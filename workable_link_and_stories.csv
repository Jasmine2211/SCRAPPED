Jacob E. asks employee, Annah Lloyd, about the THC topicals at the Harborside Health Center on Jan. 1, the first day of recreational marijuana sales in California.

President Trump says he likely will support the bipartisan congressional effort to ease federal restrictions on marijuana.

A bipartisan effort in Congress to ease federal restrictions on cannabis, which President Trump said Friday he is inclined to support, would solve a few of the biggest problems facing the nascent industry in California, experts say.

Most importantly, they say, the bill introduced Thursday — which gives states the authority to create their own marijuana laws — would open the door to banking for businesses by declaring that cannabis activities that comply with state rules do not constitute “trafficking” and their proceeds, therefore, are not the fruits of illegal transactions.

“It’s a really elegant solution,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for hundreds of marijuana farmers, business owners and patients in the state. “It doesn’t go all the way, but it does alleviate some of the day-to-day challenges we face.”

The Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act, or STATES Act, from Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Reps. David Joyce, R-Ohio, and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., would keep in place restrictions such as the bans on the sale of recreational marijuana to people under 21 and on employing anyone under 18 in a cannabis-related job.

The bill would also prohibit marijuana distribution at places such as rest areas and truck stops. By allowing states to control what happens with cannabis within their borders, the bill could also usher in new medicinal research into the drug. And industrial hemp, which can be turned into oils or fabrics, wouldn’t be classified as marijuana under the proposal.

“This is allowing the states to determine for themselves what they are going to do under recreational marijuana or medical marijuana ... and oils, anything else that they may decide, in this area of the law,” Gardner said in a joint interview with Warren on Fox News. “This is not a legalization bill. This doesn’t change the schedule. This just says that if a state like Massachusetts or Colorado decides to legalize, then that would be allowed under federal law. If a state like Oklahoma doesn’t want to do that, nothing changes.”

Trump suggested Friday he could get behind it, telling reporters, “We’re looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.” The position put him at odds with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who earlier this year encouraged federal prosecutors to file criminal charges for marijuana crimes, even in states that have legalized sale and use of the drug.

Michael Liszewski, a policy adviser with the antidrug-criminalization Drug Policy Alliance, said there are still hurdles in committees and elsewhere that need to be crossed, but was optimistic that broader marijuana reforms at the federal level are within reach.

“The fact that we had the president give some very encouraging remarks about its prospects less than a day after it was introduced — we think that changes the landscape for the better,” he said. “This would spell the end of federal interference as long as the state laws and the businesses operating under them stayed within the guard rails of the STATES Act.”

California and eight other states, as well as Washington, D.C., have legalized all adult use of marijuana. Twenty other states permit medical marijuana use.

But because of the federal prohibition, many businesses are locked out of traditional banking and lending activities. Retailers in California are known to stuff piles of cash into shopping bags and suitcases when trucking payments to state tax collectors. Lawmakers are working on a bill that would create a state charter bank for the industry.

Cities such as Oakland require cannabis business applicants to submit detailed security plans to lessen the chances of getting robbed.

“There are huge public safety implications to an all-cash industry,” Allen said.

The STATES Act could not only permit businesses to get bank accounts — since their operations would no longer be considered federal crimes — it could also allow them to deduct ordinary business expenses from their taxes, Liszewski said.

And a broader fear — that the feds could simply shut everything down someday — would potentially be abated, at least for the businesses that are licensed and in compliance with state regulations. Alex Traverso, spokesman for the California Bureau of Cannabis Control, said that worry, along with banking problems, are the chief concerns the state office hears.

The proposed law doesn’t explicitly address whether cannabis could be sold across state lines. Liszewski, though, said it might leave room for that possibility, if the states sending and receiving the product both authorized those operations.

Right now, Allen said, “The industry is crippled by the fact that we can only sell here in the state. ... What if you told the almond industry they could only sell in the state? That would be a disaster.”

12,12,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Cheap-cannabis-products-available-before-new-13032125.php,Cheap cannabis products available before new California rules kick in,"Sparc dispensary in San Francisco is selling some items for 40 percent off before new state rules go into effect Sunday.

A bonanza of cheap marijuana is flooding the market this week as growers, manufacturers and retailers unload excess cannabis in preparation for the enforcement of strict testing and packaging regulations that are sure to further shake up California’s budding industry.

The regulations took effect Jan. 1, but the state suspended enforcement during the first six months to give the industry time to prepare. The end of the transition period Sunday means all recreational and medical cannabis sold in California must be tested in state approved laboratories, sealed in child-resistant packages and labeled by the producer.

All the remaining untested products must be destroyed by Sunday. Retailers, loath to waste their stashes, are unloading stock for bargain basement prices. Discounts of as much as 50 percent have been seen this week in the Bay Area.

“I think the next couple of days here are likely to be historic lows for retail cannabis,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for some 1,250 medical marijuana farmers and business owners around the state. “I don’t think you’ll see prices this low ever again.”

The rules allow sales of cannabis that have been lab-tested for quality and have proven to be free of pesticides, chemicals and toxins. All smokable or edible products must be packaged in child-resistent containers and, before they go out to retailers, affixed with labels that outline potency and dosage amounts.

Edible cannabis goods must not have more than 10 milligrams of THC per serving or 100 milligrams per package, according to the regulations, which were regarded largely as a guideline since January, when legal sales of marijuana to adults began. The smokable stuff can have as much as 1,000 milligrams of THC per package for recreational and 2,000 milligrams for medical users, the guidelines say. All medical marijuana products must be labeled.

Cannabis policy and enforcement experts estimate that as much as $500 million worth of cannabis will have to be destroyed in California on Sunday, and it is expected to be rough going for a while as the market adapts to the rules and growers search out new distributors to replace suppliers who didn’t take the time to get a license during the grace period.

“It’s certainly going to be a disruptive and painful transition, for retailers especially,” said Allen, who expects the bargain buying to end abruptly once the regulations take hold. “There is going to be a slowdown because I don’t think the statewide supply chain exists yet.”

Prices are expected to rise, at least initially. Retailers say high prices — combined with the 15 percent excise tax on purchases of cannabis and cannabis products, including medicinal marijuana — are going to give the industry some headaches.

“I suspect we’ll have a shortage for a while until distributors get their testing figured out,” said Erich Pearson, the founder of the San Francisco Patient and Resource Center, now known as Sparc. “We’ll see limited supplies of brands and products, and probably lesser quantities, too. This at a time when we’re reaching the time of year when the highest demand for cannabis products is in the summer months.”

Growers must pay a $9.25 tax for every ounce of bud grown, along with a $2.75-an-ounce tax on dried cannabis leaves. The statewide sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent, but many cities and counties have added voter-approved district taxes, the amounts of which vary.

None of this bodes well for an industry that is already suffering from a revenue shortage. California collected $60.9 million in excise, cultivation and sales taxes in the first quarter of the year, roughly $30 million less than projections made by the state in January.

Cannabis industry officials blame the lackluster figures on the reluctance of retailers and growers to go through the legal and financial red tape of entering the legal market, a situation that has kept black market growers in business.

Allen said about half of the 1,250 marijuana businesses that he represents have obtained the temporary licenses issued by the state. State officials are expecting to complete the permanent regulations and release them for public review in mid-to-late July. That process must be completed before annual licenses are issued.

Experts say illegal growers provide about 80 percent of the pot sold in other states. Bootleg marijuana is circulating widely around Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties, known as the Emerald Triangle. An estimated 8,000 outdoor growers produce marijuana in Humboldt County, but not even half of them have filed applications under the county’s medical marijuana permit process.

“The black market is so large, and the taxes and regulations are so hard, that until the state decides to take action against the black market, it will remain a very robust and profitable business for those who participate in it,” Pearson said. “The over-regulation and taxation creates a very attractive alternative for consumers.”

Alex Traverso, communications chief for the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, urged patience while the various state agencies, including investigators, code enforcement officers and law enforcement, build strength and set priorities. He said the state has sent out more than 2,300 cease-and-desist orders to unlicensed retail and delivery services and will soon begin enforcing those orders.

“Every state that has legalized adult use of marijuana has had bumps in the road,” Traverso said. “We are very motivated to have things work, and make sure our licensees have products on their shelves and that the products are safe. If there are issues, we will find our best way forward.”

Allen said he believes many more retailers and growers will be obtaining permits once the state regulations are completed and permanent annual licenses are available. That, in turn, will improve the supply chain, he said.

Although the process of throwing out the old and bringing in the new is difficult, he said, it is necessary if California’s experiment in cannabis commerce is going to work.

“A lot of growers are excited for these requirements to be going online because, at the very least, we should be able to see the regulated market reward folks who are following the rules,” Allen said. “They’ve been competing with folks who have chosen to cut corners when it comes to pesticides. It’s exciting that for the first time in history, the entire market will be focusing on clean cannabis.”

13,13,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Legalized-marijuana-will-be-a-bit-different-from-12452940.php,Legalized marijuana will be a bit different from version that voters bought,"Some details of legalized recreational marijuana have changed since California voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016.

A San Francisco bus displays an ad for the Urban Pharm marijuana dispensary. New rules will restrict licensed marijuana sellers from placing billboards near interstate highways, schools and playgrounds.

California is days away from launching a legal marketplace for adults to buy and sell recreational marijuana. On Jan. 1, the state will carry through on a vision voters endorsed by passing Proposition 64 last year.

Yet as legal cannabis moves from campaign pitch to reality — amid lots of lobbying by industry groups along the way — some details of the plan have changed. State regulators approved the official rules last month and will update them in about a year.

“Some of the things that were touted (during the Prop. 64 campaign) definitely have been changed or reneged,” said Andrew Acosta, a political consultant who worked on the campaign against the initiative.

Here are a few ways the new rules differ from what voters may have expected:

Protecting small farms? Campaign literature supporting Prop. 64 last year said the initiative “protects small farmers, so California’s marijuana industry isn’t overrun by mega-corporations.” The measure was crafted to give small-scale growers a five-year advantage by forbidding licenses for pot farms bigger than one acre until 2023.

Now many of the mom-and-pop growers who were supposed to benefit are crying foul. They say the new rules won’t protect them because there’s no limit on the number of small-farm licenses a business can get.

“A grower can get 10 licenses and effectively be a large grower. That seems like a loophole,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, which represents more than 1,000 marijuana businesses, including many small farms in the northern reaches of the state.

Legislators from the north coast went even further, with state Sen. Mike McGuire calling the current rules “a broken promise.” A Democrat from Healdsburg, McGuire issued a statement saying that without a cap on the number of licenses, large corporations will “crush the livelihood of small family farmers.”

A spokesman for the Department of Food and Agriculture, which regulates cannabis farms under Prop. 64, said the rules don’t include a cap on small licenses “because Proposition 64 did not provide authority to impose such a limit.”

“However,” spokesman Jay Van Rein said, “local jurisdictions may impose that type of limit on their own if it meets the needs of their constituents.”

Tap-an-app delivery to your doorstep. Backers of Prop. 64 said emphatically last year that the initiative was not intended to allow on-demand delivery of recreational marijuana, a popular service among medicinal users that allows them to order cannabis products from an online menu and have drivers deliver the drugs to their door.

The Prop. 64 campaign even made the argument before a judge, saying the initiative would not allow customers to place orders online — only “in a brick and mortar establishment.”

They were trying to beat back opposition from law enforcement groups that argued that Internet-based home delivery would make it too easy for teenagers to get marijuana.

Now it turns out California will allow on-demand delivery of recreational cannabis, including for orders placed online.

“That was something we have heard a lot about from the very beginning, about how people wanted to be able to deliver to people’s homes,” said Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which held public meetings around the state during the process of drafting the recreational marijuana rules.

“After hearing the reaction from people in the industry, from patients, from people who came to summits and town halls, it became clear that it was something we needed to look at.”

Prop. 64 spokesman Jason Kinney said many local governments wanted rules that would allow for on-demand delivery. Some cities wanted to prohibit cannabis storefronts, but allow businesses to deliver it to customers who order online.

“We give them the authority to decide what takes place in their jurisdiction,” Kinney said, noting that online delivery services must have a distribution premises licensed by local officials. “We don’t view it as being in conflict” with arguments made in the Prop. 64 campaign.

Restrictions on advertising. Promises that Prop. 64 would ban cannabis ads aimed at youths permeated the campaign last year. The measure does restrict how licensed marijuana businesses can advertise, forbidding them from mounting billboards alongside interstate highways, as well as near schools and playgrounds.

But it turns out that the language of the law doesn’t cover all businesses that have a commercial interest in marijuana. It leaves out companies — like the popular website Weedmaps — that promote cannabis businesses but don’t directly sell marijuana themselves.

That’s because the law restricts advertising only by licensed marijuana businesses, and a Web platform that doesn’t directly sell marijuana doesn’t need a state license.

Weedmaps billboards — some sporting phrases like “High California,” “High Hollywood” and “High Sactown” — have popped up around the state. The company has 120 billboards up in California, including three along interstate highways, said spokesman Carl Fillichio. He said Weedmaps does not advertise near schools or playgrounds.

A bipartisan team of state legislators thinks the website should be subject to the same rules as other marijuana businesses.

“They are clearly promoting use of cannabis and advertising cannabis, and in my view, they should be subject to the same rules and regulations as licensees,” said Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda. He’s one of five lawmakers who signed a letter asking state regulators to find a way to limit ads by marijuana-focused Web platforms.

“Maybe we thought at the time when we adopted Prop. 64 that licensees was the appropriate universe to cover, but certainly Weedmaps is driving a truck through a loophole that should be closed,” Bonta said.

Kinney, the Prop. 64 spokesman, is also a lobbyist whose firm represents Weedmaps. The company spent at least $850,000 to help pass Prop. 64 last year and an additional $172,000 lobbying this year on its implementation.

He said he couldn’t comment on how Weedmaps will respond to lawmakers’ demand to limit advertising. But he noted that regulating advertising by a media platform is a “slippery slope.”

“I assume we’ll be actively part of a discussion next year,” he said.

14,14,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Oakland-s-marijuana-equity-program-is-hurting-13077077.php,Oakland’s marijuana equity program is hurting those it was supposed to help,"Alexis Bronson thinks the advantage Oakland’s cannabis equity program promised him is shrinking.

That’s because he doesn’t yet have space to grow his clone plants.

Oakland reserved half of its cannabis permits for applicants like Bronson, a black man who’s been cultivating cannabis for more than 30 years. As a teen, Bronson sold weed to his Berkeley High School classmates, but he was hoping that Oakland’s equity program would help launch a successful, sustainable business.

To qualify for the equity program, applicants had to be city residents earning less than 80 percent of the average city income. And they had to either live in a specified high-crime zone for at least 10 of the past 20 years or have been convicted of a cannabis crime in Oakland after Nov. 5, 1996.

The goal was to allow people living in parts of the city disproportionately affected by the failed war on drugs to get to the front of the pack of businesses seeking fortune in California’s cannabis gold rush.

To get the equity program off the ground, the city moved what it calls general applicants to the front of the permit line if they “incubated” equity applicants by providing them with 1,000 square feet of free business space.

The space must be provided for three years.

Bronson signed lease agreements with two incubators — NUG and Joyous Recreation & Wellness Group. He thought he’d be cultivating clones in the spaces by February, but both companies encountered significant construction delays.

According to Bronson, John Oram, CEO of Bloom Innovations, a horticulture consulting and management firm of which NUG is a subsidiary, told him his space, a greenhouse in East Oakland, would be ready in November.

Bronson told me Joyous Wellness hasn’t updated its timeline for him to move into the West Oakland warehouse.

Bronson got tired of waiting, so he asked the city to revoke the local authorization for the temporary state licenses of NUG and Joyous Wellness for failure to deliver the space. Without local authorization, businesses would run afoul of local and state cannabis laws.

“The purpose of the equity program is that we’re all starting off on a level playing field. That’s why they got the priority license,” said Bronson, who’s spent thousands on state application fees. “That’s why they incubated us. And meanwhile, I’m sitting here with no income.”

I’ve long supported the idea of Oakland’s equity program, but here is another example of how structurally flawed the implementation of the program has been. Bronson’s state licenses might expire before he gets into his spaces, and he doesn’t have the money to renew the licenses because his business isn’t generating much revenue.

And Bronson has a point: Waiting a year to start operating doesn’t seem like a head start for an equity business.

After attending a hearing for Joyous Wellness at City Hall on Friday, it seems that untangling disagreements between equity and general applicants could get messy.

Before the mediator, Denise Eaton-May, could get comfortable in her seat, the squabbling began. Joyous Wellness didn’t realize that its letter of authorization had been revoked, and that the hearing was actually an appeal of the city’s decision and not a hearing on proposed revocation.

A company representative asked for an extension, which the city granted against the wishes of Bronson’s attorney, Natalia Thurston. The hearing was rescheduled for later this month.

“There’s no enforcement of these agreements,” Thurston told me. “There’s no motivation for these people to follow through — unless the city does take action” to revoke permits.

A representative for Joyous Wellness declined to comment after the hearing. Greg Minor, an assistant city administrator who signed the revocation notices, also declined to comment.

NUG’s hearing was also scheduled for Friday, but the company had already agreed with Bronson to postpone it to July 31. The permit process for any new industry is expected to be complicated and slow, and last month I wrote about NUG’s repeated delays with building permits and inspections.

“What’s not to be expected is the city administrator’s office would not acknowledge that this delay, if anything, is the building department’s fault, not the general applicant’s fault,” said Robert Selna, an attorney representing NUG. “The building department plays a significant role in the fact that Alexis Bronson doesn’t have his greenhouse space.”

Revoking permits absolves the city from any role in the equity program’s problems. But the city shouldn’t escape without fault, because the city provided the incentive — no, the reason — for general and equity applicants to form partnerships in the first place.

Selna said NUG doesn’t blame Bronson for asking the city to revoke NUG’s letter of authorization. In fact, Selna attended the Joyous Wellness hearing and spoke to Thurston, Bronson’s attorney. The two sides are working to reach a settlement before their hearing.

In the meantime, Bronson has watched his nursery business wilt. He said his clone-selling season is from February to June, when he makes most of his money for the year.

Bronson has been trying to subsist by growing plants in the garage of his East Oakland home. Because he has limited space, he’s only been able to produce clones for popular strains like Purple Punch. He says his connections with dispensaries have dried up.

“Because I can’t deliver a consistent experience,” Bronson said. “I don’t have enough room to produce clones week in, week out to compete with my competitors. This is allowing my competitors to get a leg up on me.”

And that’s not what the equity program intended.

Bongs are available at a discount at the annual Hempfest at Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle. Soon recreational marijuana will be legal in California, too.

At the risk of alienating essentially everyone in California, I’m just going to come right out and say this: I don’t like the smell of pot smoke.

To me, it’s a cross between a decomposing animal and grilled cheese left on the stove too long. It’s not a happy smell; it’s the aroma of Market Street on a hot day, of lost jobs and bounced checks, of cold pizza and bad TV, of brain cells withering, of wet towels rumpled in a corner.

And, as everyone knows, it’s now atmospheric. That’s because last year 7.9 million California voters, myself included, decided to legalize marijuana. Granted, it was pretty much legal already in that police didn’t really enforce marijuana laws, such as they are, but soon pot will be regulated and taxed around the state. It will be as legal as chocolate milk.

Which means that rancid earthy stench will be a fixture of streetscapes and playgrounds and bar patios forever, from Crescent City to Chula Vista. Pot is now officially among the pantheon of socially acceptable vices, just like vodka tonics and Marlboro cigarettes and diet Coke.

I have no issue with the legality. After all, life can be hard, and who am I to begrudge anyone an occasional escape? And no question, growers should comply with environmental laws and pay taxes like everyone else.

But here’s what I do not understand: Diet soda, cigarettes and booze are recognized as exactly that — vices. They’re affixed with government warning labels and laden with “sin taxes.” Millions of people enjoy them, but there’s a universal acknowledgment that they’re not good for you.

But pot seems exempt from that degenerate reputation. In fact, it’s almost celebrated as a health food. Illuminated billboards loom over Interstate 80, proclaiming in full-Vegas neon: Smoke-o-Rama! Pot Town! High and Mighty! Pot stores have come to resemble friendly neighborhood cafes. People walk down Main Street smoking pot like it’s no more unusual than chewing gum or chatting on their phones.

I was at a social gathering the other day and everyone was debating the hallucinatory nuances of various strains of edibles, as if they were a Napa Pinot Noir. A whole new vocabulary is dawning — soon we’ll all know the micro-appellations of Humboldt and Mendocino counties, the names of well-respected growers, and clever new words for “stoned.” Just like we know the difference between Old Milwaukee and Pliny the Elder, and the difference between “slightly buzzed” and “throwing up.” It used to be just about seeds and stems; now it’s about vintage and varietals, as fetishized as the menu at a five-star restaurant in Yountville.

But somewhere in all this drug mania we seem to have forgotten what every college freshman already knows: Pot makes you stupid. Or it will, if you smoke it enough. (Some people report great medical benefits from pot. This is not about them.)

Is this something we really want to encourage on a mass scale?

As the parent of teenagers, I can’t say I’m in favor of this. I spend a lot of time advising my children, “Don’t smoke pot. Don’t drink. Don’t do dumb things. Pass algebra. Don’t get arrested. Go to college. Do not bring shame upon me.” Needless to say, I am powerless next to the 40-foot “Welcome to Weed World!” billboard.

And what about the smell? Why is it that, in some circles, wearing lavender hand cream is forbidden in deference to those who have fragrance sensitivities, and people recoil dramatically at the smell of cigarettes, but no one complains about pot smoke? Pot smoke is a million times stinkier than lavender hand cream! If Telegraph Avenue was awash in clouds of lavender, I might be more inclined to shop there.

I suppose all of these contradictions are part of the long, dysfunctional continuum that is our love/hate relationship with drugs and booze. Opioids, which are legal, are now the source of a national emergency. Meanwhile, voters in some states are legalizing marijuana. Suburban moms brag on Facebook about getting drunk at book club meetings, while AA programs are busting at the seams. As a culture, we are sending mixed messages to the young ’uns.

I’m looking forward to the day legal pot is no longer a novelty. Maybe it’ll settle in with all the other guilty pleasures and not be revered as some pseudo-spiritual health tonic. It can be accepted as a reliable, temporary source of relief in a harsh and unpredictable world, but not something you want to make a habit of or brag about. And maybe, just maybe, some Humboldt grower will find a way to make it smell like lavender.

16,16,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Berkeley-boy-was-Patient-X-in-first-13057044.php,Berkeley boy was ‘Patient X’ in first FDA-approved medicine derived from marijuana,"Dr. Maria Roberta Cilio of UCSF conducted the clinical trial that included Sam and led to FDA approval of Epidiolex.

Sam, with his life back after using cannabidiol, watches a show on his phone at his home.

Sam Vogelstein, 17, plays with Maisy at his home in Berkeley. He was the first person to use cannabidiol to control epilepsy.

They called him Patient X.

The Berkeley boy had his first epileptic seizure when he was 4, and after that, they kept coming, up to 100 a day. His desperate parents tried a barrage of two dozen medications, plus a high-fat medical diet and autoimmune therapy.

But nothing worked — not until a British company let him try a marijuana-based drug.

Sam Vogelstein, now 17, was the only patient in an early test that was unheard of in medical circles. The high-concentration cannabidiol strain had never been given to children and was illegal in the United States, even though the drug had been stripped of its high-inducing chemical.

It worked. And now, after six years and a clinical trial led by UCSF, the drug is available for others. On June 25, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Epidiolex for treatment of two severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

It is the first time the FDA has approved a medicine derived from marijuana. It won’t work for every patient, but for Sam’s family, it’s everything.

“What I went through, I know, was not normal,” said Sam, a junior at Sterne High School in San Francisco. “It’s not something anyone should have to go through. I hope I’m able to somehow make a large impact.”

It started, seemingly, with a judo bow.

Evelyn Nussenbaum and her husband, Fred Vogelstein, were saying goodbye to a college friend who had spent the evening at their home. Sam let his head drop, like a martial artist, then snapped it back.

“Why did you do that?” his mother asked.

“I don’t know,” the 4-year-old said.

Two months passed. Sam did it again. This time, they were in New York visiting Vogelstein’s family. Sam bowed and didn’t know why. Soon, it was happening once a week. His twin, Beatrice, seemed unaffected.

Definitely a nervous tick, Vogelstein said. Definitely something more, Nussenbaum replied.

They fought about it, back and forth, not ready to receive a heavy truth. Eventually, they took Sam to the hospital for an electroencephalogram.

“They said he had a seizure disorder,” Nussenbaum said. “I didn’t know that meant epilepsy. When I looked it up, my heart dropped. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, my God, it’s epilepsy.’”

The misfiring of Sam’s electrical system changed the family’s trajectory. His disorder was an uncrackable riddle that doctors and medication could not solve.

The boy fell down a flight of stairs. He cracked a window pane with his head, and went facedown in a plate of spaghetti. “Glad I don’t remember that one,” he said. He didn’t have grand mal seizures, characterized by collapsing and twitching on the ground. Instead, for five to 20 seconds, his face would go slack and he would seemingly leave his body.

When Sam regained consciousness, things would be slightly different. At school, his classmates would angrily urge him — the line leader — forward. They didn’t understand why he was standing still. He would spend an hour learning a math formula, only to have a seizure and forget it.

His life was like a scratched DVD; entire portions were missing. Some medications helped, but many didn’t. And their side effects were severe: anger, full-body rashes, or hallucinations that bugs were crawling from holes in his skin.

More than 3.4 million people in the United States have epilepsy, but because of the brain’s complexity, relatively little is known about how to treat the disorder. As Sam got older, there were seemingly fewer options. Then Nussenbaum, a journalist who had given up her career to care for her son, found an article on cannabidiol in Seizure, a British medical journal.

Maybe this was the secret.

Known as CBD, the purified drug has no trace of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the euphoria-inducing chemical in marijuana. In one study, cannabidiol had stopped seizures in rodents. It could work for Sam, too, his parents thought.

“We are out of options,” Nussenbaum thought. “How can I get cannabidiol?”

She and her husband joined an underground cannabidiol collective, but when they tested what they received they found more THC than CBD in the concoction. They had a family friend buy marijuana from a dealer in Oakland and purify it in her kitchen. But the process was long and costly, and it made her suburban home smell like pot. There had to be a better way.

Eventually, with the help of family friends, Nussenbaum and Vogelstein persuaded British company GW Pharmaceuticals to test a cannabis-based oil for epileptic children. The firm had previously gained market approval in the United Kingdom for another cannabis derivative, for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Sam would be their test dummy — the only one.

The one-person trial had to be done overseas because the U.S. government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, the same tier as heroin. Sam’s parents paid thousands of dollars out of pocket for airfare, hotels and medical co-payments to make it possible.

“I knew we were going on a trip to London for whatever medical reason,” Sam said. “I don’t think I really understood what was happening. But it changed my life.”

Within days of traveling from Berkeley to London and taking the cannabidiol, Sam’s seizures plummeted from 68 to six per day, and then to zero. With no side effects.

Dr. Maria Roberta Cilio moved from Rome to join UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in 2011 and had been appointed as a professor of neurology and pediatrics in 2012 when she met Sam. Though she was still relatively new, she began lobbying the FDA for a compassionate use trial, in which illegal drugs can be used outside of a clinical trial.

“Sam’s life had completely changed because of CBD,” Cilio recalled. “For this particular patient, for him, it was a huge change.”

After four months, the FDA approved the trial. But the Drug Enforcement Administration was less convinced.

One day in 2013, agents unexpectedly showed up at Cilio’s office at UCSF and questioned her for two hours — a scene that reminded her of a crime show — about whether she had used drugs and how she would store the imported cannabidiol oil. In the end, they made her obtain a 965-pound safe for storing the medicine.

That May, Cilio began giving Epidiolex to Sam. His parents had ordered a special hemp oil through the mail as a makeshift medication during the four-month interim period. It wasn’t as effective.

Sam was the first patient to receive the drug, and 162 children and young adults in 11 epilepsy centers across the nation would follow, receiving 12-week courses of the drops.

Cilio’s research, published in 2015 in the Lancet Neurology, showed a 36.5 percent average reduction in monthly motor seizures, which affect muscle activity. In the last month of the trial, she said, some patients who once had hundreds of seizures a day were completely free of them.

“Drugs are normally only tested in adults first. This time, it was the opposite. The drug had never been used in humans, let alone children. It worked,” Cilio said.

“I feel that we followed the right path that was not easy,” she said. “I was not pro, and I was not con, about marijuana. I took it as I would have done any drug. I wrote a protocol that was strict and rigorous and accurate, and this is the reason the FDA approved it for the first time.”

How cannabidiol alleviates seizures at a molecular level, though, remains unclear. More studies are needed.

Recently, on the anniversary of Sam’s seizures stopping, the family celebrated by making ice cream sundaes at their Berkeley home. They sprayed whip cream on each other’s faces, and Nussenbaum got a perfect beard and mustache.

“Genius comes from the smallest of things,” Sam said, smiling. “I saw the can of whipped cream while my mom was shopping and knew just what I wanted to use it for.”

Sam wants to get his driver’s license. He wants to be a counselor at an epilepsy camp so he can help other kids who went through what he did. He might even get a job at a comic book store. This fall, he’ll start competing in fencing. He knows these are all things someone suffering from severe seizures can’t do. But that’s not him anymore.

Sometimes he thinks back to the London trip, when he first tried Epidiolex. On one of the last days, he went zip-lining 30 feet over Hyde Park, something that would have been unthinkable even a week earlier. For the first time in a long time, he felt like an average kid — and a healthy one.

Flying through the air, he felt free. He wasn’t Patient X. He was just Sam.

17,17,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-marijuana-purveyors-go-mainstream-12532315.php,"California marijuana purveyors go mainstream, except for the sacks of cash","A marijuana business owner’s cash tax payment sits on a counter at the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in Oakland.

A marijuana business owner pays his taxes in cash at the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in Oakland, CA, on Monday November 27, 2017.

Bay Area marijuana retailers who went fully mainstream this month were forced to act like gangsters anyway as they rumbled down freeways and across bridges in sport utility vehicles and sedans and, in at least one case, a Tesla, bearing cash piled in shopping bags and suitcases.

The money was headed for the collectors at the San Francisco and Oakland offices of the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, which are handling tax payments under the 2016 state law that legalized recreational cannabis.

Everyone agrees the bundles of moola are a lure for criminals, but merchants who can’t access traditional banking have no other way to settle up. A month after California’s first recreational marijuana shops opened, the industry is mired in a fiscal free-for-all with few answers on how to handle the explosion of cash from rising sales and increased taxes.

Industry leaders estimate that 70 percent of the more than 1,600 recreational and medical dispensaries in the state are still dealing in cash. They must lug stacks of 20s, 50s and 100s to the tax collector every month, payments that are growing after California on Jan. 1 initiated a 15 percent cannabis tax on top of sales taxes.

The Wild West situation stems from marijuana remaining illegal under federal law, which prompts banks that might open accounts and extend loans to fear money-laundering charges.

In the latest bid for a solution, state Sen. Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, introduced legislation Thursday that would allow state-chartered banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to open accounts and issue checks for marijuana retailers.

Members of Congress have also sought protections, and Oakland and San Francisco have studied the idea of a public bank, but U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pushed in the other direction, signaling he favors a marijuana crackdown.

Frustrated state Treasurer John Chiang urged California in November to hire armored cars to help pick up the taxes, which industry experts predict will top $1 billion a year. But many courier services are fearful of being targeted by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, and nothing has been done.

Instead, 90 percent of all cash tax payments to the state are now made by the cannabis industry, officials said.

“Certainly it’s an impediment to doing business,” said Erich Pearson, the founder of the San Francisco Patient and Resource Center, or SPARC, the city’s largest cannabis outlet. “A lack of banking has all sorts of logistical and operational challenges ... so you have safes and cameras and security.”

The issue has intensified since Jan. 1, when the state put new taxes on retailers, growers and manufacturers. California businesses must normally pay a penalty for dealing in cash, but those in the cannabis trade can obtain a waiver, officials said.

Recent events in San Francisco and Oakland have only worsened the cash-only dilemma. The San Francisco tax collector closed in the fall after the office was accidentally flooded, forcing dozens of marijuana purveyors to drive to Oakland or Sacramento. The office reopened Jan. 22.

Earlier this month, the Oakland tax office became so swamped with currency that officials notified retailers it would only accept $20,000 in cash a day — a move that would have required some businesses to make multiple trips. The limit was rescinded shortly after The Chronicle inquired about it.

Tax authorities could not provide data on how much cash they are receiving and from how many businesses, but shop owners in San Francisco said it was not uncommon for them to haul in $80,000 at a time.

While no recent robberies have been reported publicly, dispensary workers across the country have fallen victim to cash heists over the years, including an Orange County dispensary owner who was kidnapped in 2012 and sexually tortured by four thieves trying to force him to hand over money. Another risk is that police or federal agents might confiscate gains considered ill-gotten.

“It’s a burden for the whole industry,” said Erick Alfaro, director of operations for the Green Cross in San Francisco, whose boss Kevin Reed had to make two trips to Oakland in his Tesla to pay taxes this month. “Walking around with that large amount of money is definitely a danger and a safety concern for us.”

Before January, medical dispensaries were required to pay state sales taxes that amounted to around $50 million annually, plus varying local taxes. Officials said only about a third of dispensaries paid all they owed — a shortfall that became one of the arguments for legalization.

The newly raised taxes will pay for marijuana research and regulation as well as programs to prevent drug abuse, protect the environment and test for pesticides.

Despite the windfall, bank managers contemplating opening cannabis accounts remain wary, and got no encouragement from Attorney General Sessions, who on Jan. 4 rescinded a memo issued under President Barack Obama’s administration that instructed the Department of Justice to leave cannabis businesses alone in states where the drug is legal.

“It would be ridiculous for banks like ours to bank in marijuana,” said Jim Brush, the president and chief executive of Summit State Bank in Santa Rosa, a state-chartered institution subject to federal regulation.

“Anytime we think there is anything to do with marijuana, we have to report that as suspicious activity because its illegal,” Brush said. “I have heard of some banks that have started it, but usually within a few months they aren’t doing it anymore. The fines can be substantial.”

Before Sessions rescinded the Obama administration directive, known as the Cole memo, 400 banks in the country had cannabis customers, according to a September 2017 study by the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

It isn’t clear how many banks have cut ties since. Industry experts say the institutions that remain are mostly small credit unions or banks where branch managers negotiate side deals without telling their corporate bosses about the clients’ marijuana connection.

Such arrangements can be fleeting, and many merchants have been forced to move from one institution to another as audits flag their accounts. Henry Wykowski, an attorney who represents Oakland’s Harborside dispensary and more than 100 other cannabis businesses in California, said he was bounced by Comerica Inc. after 25 years as a client, apparently after they found out he was depositing legal fees paid in cash by the dispensary.

Other outlets wire money to banks or use debit cards and ATM processing machines supplied by independent merchant-services groups, like CreditWeed and Green Kinex. But the fees can be 5 percent or more per transaction.

“We do receive inquiries from different companies offering credit card terminals, but there are quite a bit of fees,” said Alfaro, who recently received an offer with a 10-percent overall charge. “That wouldn’t be a really efficient way for us to run our business. It would be like them being a part-owner.”

Wykowski said the restrictions may open doors for drug cartels, which have experience dealing in cash and providing the kind of muscle needed to protect it.

“Not allowing cannabis businesses to engage in banking is actually detrimental to the federal government because there are now billions of dollars on the underground economy and all of it is cash that you can’t track,” Wykowski said. “Most businesses have found some type of accommodation, but the accommodation we have found is putting duct tape on the leaky pipe rather than replacing it.”

18,18,CA,www.ocregister.com,http://www.ocregister.com/marijuana-shops-will-have-glut-of-cheap-weed-followed-by-a-possible-shortage,"Marijuana shops will have glut of cheap weed, followed by a possible shortage","Cannabis consumers soon should be able to shop at licensed stores in California without worrying about whether products on the shelves are laced with pesticides and other contaminants often found in black-market weed.

Customers also will be able to see, on the package, how potent their products are, where they came from, and what other ingredients are used in any cannabis-infused edibles.

But all that will be true once new state-mandated safety standards for marijuana kick in July 1. Until then, consumers can expect to see something of a cannabis roller coaster.

For the next few weeks, retailers will do what they can to move stockpiles of untested product left over from California’s unregulated gray market. What they can’t sell by July 1, in theory, they’ll have to destroy.

And once the old inventory is cleared out, experts say, licensed shops might be looking at a very different problem — a cannabis shortage.

Inventory piled up

Many marijuana shops loaded up on inventory in late 2017, before California, on New Years Day, launched legal recreational marijuana sales and imposed hundreds of pages of ew rules for the cannabis industry.

State regulators gave businesses a six-month grace period to sell off their old stockpiles, as long as the packaging told customers that the product didn’t meet new state standards. But sales this year have been slower than expected, and many shops still have lots of unsold inventory, said Josh Drayton, spokesman for the California Cannabis Industry Association.

Retailers were hoping the state might extend the grace period on some products, but that’s not happening. Over the past week, the Bureau of Cannabis Control sent out reminder notices telling retailers that the new rules will be firm starting July 1.

“We gave everyone six months to use up their supply on hand and get ready for the new standards that were coming July 1,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the state’s cannabis bureau. “We felt like that was a sufficient amount of transition time.”

New rules coming

Here are the new cannabis regulations that kick in July 1.

— Products must be tested in a licensed lab. Tests must check for levels of THC, the compound in cannabis that makes people high, and CBD, the compound thought to have the most medical benefits. They also must check for contaminants such as pesticides and fungus.

— Products must be properly labeled. Labels must include lab results, a universal symbol for cannabis products, the date the product was made and a safety warning. Edibles also must list ingredients and nutrition information. And no products can include cartoons, the word “candy,” or make unproven health claims.

— There will be new THC limits. Edibles will only be allowed to have 100 milligrams of THC per package, and they must be delineated into 10-milligram servings. Nonedible cannabis products, such as oils and topicals, will only be allowed to have 1,000 milligrams of THC if they’re for recreational consumers. They can have 2,000 milligrams of THC if they’re sold to medical marijuana patients.

— Products must come in child-resistant packaging. The state has been letting retailers put products in child-resistant packaging at the time of sale. But starting July 1, distributors will have to seal marijuana products in child-resistant packaging before sending them to stores.

Bottlenecks coming?

One rule that was set to apply July 1 — requiring medical and recreational cannabis retailers to work with only medical and recreational suppliers, respectively — has been dropped out of concern that it would create shortages in the cannabis supply chain.

But some experts are still worried about bottlenecks in other segments of the industry.

For example, the Bureau of Cannabis Control has licensed just 28 labs statewide, so far, and a number of those haven’t yet opened their doors.

In theory, with less than three weeks left before the licensing rules kick in, that should have led to a glut of products in the licensing pipeline. But for Steep Hill lab in Berkeley, while there has been an uptick in business, it hasn’t been as big as expected, according to chief revenue officer Tony Daniel.

“We were a little surprised that more growers and producers weren’t coming to the labs to make sure that their products were going to survive compliance,” Daniel said. He noted that many businesses seemingly skirt the rules for as long as possible so they can pocket the 1 to 5 percent that testing adds to wholesale prices.

Steep Hill more than doubled in size in recent months, leading up to the July 1 deadline, Daniel said. So, when business begins to surge in the next few weeks, he doesn’t expect any delays in turnaround time.

But Daniel also said companies that haven’t had their products tested could be in for a rude awakening if they discover they have clean-up work to do before they can send items to market. That, in turn, could leave shops without enough legal product to sell.

Enforcement question lingers

The degree to which California’s marijuana industry falls in line with the new policies — or continues pushing product to the state’s still-thriving black market — will depend largely on whether the state puts teeth into its rules, Daniel said.

“Regulation without enforcement is completely worthless,” he said.

The Bureau of Cannabis Control has been doing compliance checks all over the state, Traverso said, and will continue those checks after July 1.

But the state has largely been issuing warning notices, giving businesses time to comply with the new rules. And state funds to support stepped-up enforcement have so far been stripped from the budget.

As tough as the environment is for regulated businesses, Drayton of the Cannabis Industry Association is urging cannabis entrepreneurs to be proactive about compliance and to support the safety rules set to kick in July 1.

“We fought for legalization with public safety and public health in mind,” he said.

“This date needed to happen at some point.”"
19,19,CA,www.ocregister.com,http://www.ocregister.com/state-gives-marijuana-businesses-more-time-for-compliance,State gives marijuana businesses more time for compliance,"The transition to a fully regulated cannabis industry is taking California a bit longer than anticipated.

While state regulators scramble to extend temporary marijuana business licenses, they’re also considering whether to extend a grace period that gives operators extra time to comply with strict new industry standards.

As of Monday, a tenth of the 6,000 temporary cannabis licenses state regulators have issued were set to expire by May 1, which marks the four-month anniversary of the start of legal recreational marijuana sales in California. A third of all existing licenses were due to lapse by the start of June.

The state hasn’t issued any full annual licenses yet. And the first approvals are likely still at least four weeks out.

Instead, regulators are extending provisional permits for another 90 days while businesses deal with complex regulations, backlogs in getting local approval and, it seems, their own procrastination.

“Part of the problem, I think, is that people wait until the last minute,” said Lori Ajax, chief of California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control. “I’m a procrastinator sometimes. I get it, so I’m not upset.”

Only 278 businesses had even applied for annual licenses as of April 25. That includes just 24 cultivators, 61 manufacturers and 193 retailers, distributors or testers, according to figures provided by the three agencies regulating marijuana businesses.

If businesses don’t get complete applications in before their temporary permits expire, they’ll be required to shut down until however long it takes them to get annual authorization. Ajax said her staff will inspect sites to insure compliance.

Still, neither state regulators nor industry insiders seem too concerned about the slow pace of processing, with everyone confident that a coming flood of temporary permit extensions will take care of the problem.

State regulators created simple temporary licenses, good for 120 days, so they could hit a mandated Jan. 1 target to launch recreational sales and regulate all segments of California’s massive marijuana market for the first time.

The goal was to give marijuana business owners time to compile the additional information needed to get annual licenses, including security plans, insurance bonds, business formation documents and fingerprinting for all owners. It also gave the state time to review and verify conditions needed for annual licenses, such as local approval.

The temporary licenses came with an optional 90-day extension. Now it seems all businesses will need to take advantage of that provision.

Delays in licensing don’t seem to be happening at the state level. In fact, industry operators say state agencies have been extremely prompt about processing applications and responsive in answering questions that pop up along the way.

“When you think about the herculean task they had, they did a really good job,” said Rob Bernheimer, chief counselor for Irvine-based Cultivation Technologies.

But the requirement that operators show they have permission from their local jurisdiction before they can get a state license has proven particularly challenging.

While the Bureau of Cannabis Control had approved 1,779 licenses as of April 25, Ajax said they’d denied another 1,150 license applications. About 90 percent of the denials were issued because businesses didn’t have approval form their city or county to set up shop.

More than two-thirds of California cities don’t allow any cannabis businesses at all, according to a statewide database of policies compiled by the Southern California News Group.

Some cities and counties that do have policies on the books to allow the industry have been slow in rolling out local permits. Sonoma and Nevada counties, for example, have substantial backlogs in processing local applications to grow cannabis, according to Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association trade group.

The application process itself also is challenging, Allen said, noting that he’s seen annual license applications that were 300 pages long.

It took Bernheimer and his team of dedicated staff about a month to put together all of the information needed in the four separate annual license applications they submitted to manufacture and distribute both medical and recreational cannabis out of Coachella.

Then there are the fees associated with state annual licenses, which range from $800 up to $120,000 a year, depending on the business type and size. Allen said some small cultivators are being priced out of business, particularly when state fees are added to the fees associated with local permits and the price of operational upgrades needed to comply with new regulations.

Given these challenges, Ajax said the state is also considering extending a grace period they offered businesses to comply with portions of the hundreds of pages of new state regulations. That includes letting shops sell inventory that doesn’t meet new testing and packaging requirements, and allowing businesses to keep working with other licensed operators without worrying about whether their permits are for medical and recreational activities.

That grace period is set to expire July 1. But many stores stocked up on inventory before new regulations kicked in, so Ajax said owners are saying they’re still going to have lots of unsold product if that July 1 date sticks. Also, she said giving operators more time before they have additional limits on who they can do business with will probably be needed to help avoid any hiccups in the supply chain.

We saw supply chain issues in other states as they struggled to launch regulated cannabis markets. In Nevada, for example, a delay in licensing distributors meant retailers were running out of product just days after recreational marijuana sales launched there on July 1, 2017.

California regulators say they’re proud to report they haven’t had those kinds of issues here, even while rolling out licenses and rules for the world’s largest legal marijuana market.

Extending temporary permits and the grace period on some compliance issues will help them maintain a steady flow of licensed product, Ajax said. But it also means it will likely be late summer before California cannabis consumers can be sure products they’re buying have been lab tested, tracked from seed to sale, sold by vendors that have cleared background checks and passed other security measures.

Meanwhile, the state is also busy creating final regulations for the cannabis industry.

Businesses are now operating under 276 pages of emergency regulations issued in mid-November. California’s Cannabis Advisory Committee has been meeting to discuss changes to these rules, and Ajax said she expects quite a few adjustments once final plans come out in perhaps two months.

Some issues on the table are possibly loosening hours of operation for retailers, limits on delivery services and a requirement that vertically integrated businesses must use distributors to move products even on their own campuses, Ajax said.

“There’s plenty of room for improvement and we’re OK with that because I just think that makes for a better product,” she said.

As final rules are approved and temporary permits expire, Ajax said the state does plan to step up enforcement in the second half of 2018.

They’ve already sent out cease and desist letters to nearly 1,000 businesses that don’t seem to have made any attempt to comply with new state laws, including the giant dispensary-mapping service Weedmaps. Soon, Ajax said her small agency will begin partnering with the Department of Consumers and local law enforcement to shut down unlicensed businesses.

But even at that stage, Ajax said they’ll still be taking into consideration operators who are trying to get local permits or otherwise follow the rules, since the goal is to move as many businesses as possible into the regulated marketplace.

“It’s not as black and white as a regulator would like it to be,” she said. “But I think there just comes a point where we’ve got to cut it off.”"

Someone began banging on her front door. As she moved to open it, she saw a line of police officers in her front yard and red laser gun sights coming through the windows, bouncing off her and her children.

Officers searched her home. They found and took blueprints for a kitchen remodel project and her cell phone.

At the same time, 80 miles due east in San Bernardino, dozens of officers were raiding two warehouses and another home owned by Smith. They seized nearly 25,000 marijuana plants and arrested eight men for growing cannabis in the three locations without city permits.

Smith wasn’t arrested or fined. But headlines the next day painted the 43-year-old as a “queenpin” and the “mastermind” of a multimillion-dollar illegal marijuana-growing operation.

“To be labeled a ‘drug lord’ in international press was a surprise,” she said.

“I don’t even have house plants.”

Though the mother of five boasts that she’s the biggest cannabis landlord in California, Smith insists she’s just that, a landlord. She says she isn’t involved with the marijuana businesses ran by her tenants.

Smith also insists her San Bernardino clients weren’t hiding. She says they’re part of California’s entrenched cannabis industry that’s struggling to join the emerging legal market, and that those efforts are being hampered by “corrupt” and “regressive” city policies.

Smith shrank from public attention when she was part of a very different scandal a decade ago, legally changing her last name to something that’s as anonymous as it can get.

This time, she says she’s fighting back.

Smith has filed lawsuits against San Bernardino and three other Inland Empire cities over their marijuana policies. And she’s floating marijuana ballot measures in six communities, determined to make conditions fairer for the industry that’s been so good to her.

First brush with infamy

Smith, whose name at birth was Stephanie Darcy, was raised in Minneapolis by a single working mom. She grew up dreaming of being an artist, and she still nurses a passion for painting.

After studying marketing in Boston, and using her artist’s eye to flip houses in the Phoenix area, she moved to Southern California in 2005 to attend business school at UCLA.

She was dating and working for Dr. Craig Alan Bittner, who had a successful liposuction practice in Beverly Hills. Things were going well until 2008, when a trio of lawsuits claimed Bittner had let Smith perform botched liposuction procedures even though she had no medical training. The lawsuits were eventually dismissed.

“At the end of the day, I made a regulatory mistake a decade ago and paid a $242 fine,” Smith said.

Things got more complicated when authorities caught wind that Bittner was violating medical waste laws by using fat removed from his patients to power his and Smith’s cars.

Smith said the intent with “LipoDiesel” was never to suggest that people could actually run their vehicles on human fat. She said it was simply a way to illustrate what was possible if people opened their minds to alternative energy sources. And she said they asked permission from every client, with all but one of some 8,000 patients enthusiastically consenting.

There was no word for internet “trolls” then, but Smith said she was intimidated into silence.

“If I could go back in time, I would have talked very openly about our goals for changing our view of energy,” she said. “I would have talked about my passion for the environment instead of being afraid.”

Becoming a cannabis landlord

Smith’s foray into another controversial industry started as a favor.

With the housing market in crisis a decade ago, Smith dove into commercial real estate.

A friend of a friend was growing cannabis under California’s loose medical marijuana laws as he put himself through law school in 2009. But he was struggling to find space to house his operation, with local and federal policies that made it risky for landlords to take on marijuana tenants.

Smith says she’s never been a “hardcore” marijuana consumer herself. “But like a lot of people, I wanted the laws changed.” So she let the small-time grower lease one of her L.A. properties.

The tenant finished law school and moved on. So Smith put the site back on the market, thinking its water and power stations would make for a good laundromat or nail salon.

She said she had no idea then that anyone would recognize signs of a grow house. But 45 minutes after the property went up on Craigslist, a cultivator offered double the asking price. Soon, she was in a bidding war, eventually landing a grower who paid three times the requested rent.

Sound The gallery will resume in seconds

Today, she said her company, Industrial Partners Group, owns two million square feet of industrial space. Most of it is in Southern California, but she has property as far north as Sacramento. And, while she rents buildings to Walmart and bakeries, many of her warehouses are leased to cannabis growers and manufacturers.

One reason Smith believes she’s been so successful is that many cannabis entrepreneurs were accustomed to dealing with landlords who refused to sign leases or made them use fake names so they could feign ignorance. Smith said she tried to “inject some professionalism” by treating them like other valuable tenants.

She’s also discreet.

B-Real, stage name for lead Cypress Hill rapper Louis Freese, leases a Downtown L.A. warehouse from Smith. When asked if she has any other famous tenants, Smith pauses, flashes her frequent smile and says: “I have a nice reputation among hip-hop and sports celebrities.”

Smith considers her work with the industry a form of activism. But this election cycle, she says, is different.

“This is my first time taking it to the streets.”

Raid prompts activism

Smith wore a gray cotton shirt, jeans and colorful sneakers on a recent Friday evening as she joined a political support team canvassing San Bernardino’s Verdemont neighborhood. The goal is to collect the 8,602 signatures needed to get her proposed cannabis measure on the November ballot.

Residents seemed largely receptive, though they’ve been through this before.

When Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana under Proposition 64 in 2016, San Bernardino voters also approved Measure O, which laid out a framework for cannabis businesses to operate in town.

The measure was needed because Prop. 64 gives cities the rights to regulate businesses in their borders. And a study of local marijuana policies shows more than two-thirds of cities in California still bans all marijuana ventures.

San Bernardino awarded its first business permit under Measure O last year, to the owners of Flesh Showgirls. They now run a strip club in one half of the building and Captain Jack’s marijuana dispensary in the other.

But multiple lawsuits were filed over Measure O, and in December a judge threw the initiative out because, he said, it used spot zoning to create a monopoly that allowed just two shops in town. That ruling is being appealed.

Smith says her San Bernardino tenants had applied at least eight times for licenses to operate their businesses legally under Measure O, inviting city officials to inspect their high-end security and odor filtration systems.

A week after the raids, she said two of the tenants received letters from the city saying they could legally grow marijuana if they paid $140,000 in fees. Smith said they paid up but still haven’t been cleared to operate, leaving 100 people out of work. And she said police have been called 10 times since the raids over reports of vandalism and homeless people squatting in the vacant buildings.

The city is now accepting applications under its own licensing scheme. But a new policy says companies previously deemed to be operating illegally aren’t eligible for permits, leaving Smith’s clients with no route to run legal cannabis businesses in San Bernardino.

City and police officials declined to comment on any of Smith’s claims, citing pending and potential litigation.

Branching out

Spurred by what happened in San Bernardino, Smith has filed additional lawsuits against Colton, Hemet and Moreno Valley.

Concerns raised in the suits include Colton’s requirement that residents get permission from the city if they want to grow marijuana plants at home for personal use, as allowed under Prop. 64. And that anyone working for a marijuana business in Moreno Valley, from contractors to janitors, first get a city permit.

Her team is also collecting signatures for marijuana ballot measures in Colton, Hemet, Upland, Bakersfield and Kern County.

The initiatives are tailored for each area, Smith said. That means Central Valley policies support a cultivation-heavy market while San Bernardino is encouraged to put its affordable industrial properties to work by becoming a manufacturing hub, making vape pens and edibles popular with cannabis consumers.

California is close to an inflection point, Smith believes, where marijuana businesses won’t have to hide or beg cities to let them in. When that happens, Smith said she hopes Southern California cities will have fair policies in place that position them to compete for the jobs and tax revenue the cannabis industry can generate.

And Smith, of course, will have properties ready to house those valuable tenants."
22,22,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/04/09/database-of-marijuana-rules-from-every-city-and-county-in-california-shows-slow-acceptance-of-prop-64/,Marijuana laws for every city and county? Our database shows California slow to accept Prop. 64,"Fewer than one in three California cities (144 out of 482) allow any kind of cannabis business to operate in their borders. And just 18 of the state’s 58 counties permit cannabis businesses in their unincorporated areas.

Also, fewer than one in five California cities welcome medical marijuana dispensaries, while fewer than one in seven allow recreational cannabis stores, where anyone 21 and older has been able to shop for legal weed since Jan. 1.

These are some of the findings in a first-of-its-kind investigation, tracking and compiling the cannabis ordinances in all 540 city and county jurisdictions in California, a study conducted by Southern California News Group and other Digital First newspapers.

The information opens a window into how the industry is taking shape three months after California began licensing marijuana businesses and permitting the sale of recreational marijuana.

The study is needed because of a simple rule in California: While Proposition 64 (approved by 57 percent of state voters in November 2016) makes it legal for people to carry up to an ounce of marijuana and to grow it at home and consume it for pleasure, the law also gives cities and counties a strong say in how that law is implemented within their jurisdictions.

That dichotomy has led to a crazy quilt of policies across the state. Some towns are cannabis friendly, allowing a wide range of businesses related to a product that residents are free to use at their discretion. Other cities are less enthusiastic, with some blocking virtually every type of marijuana-related enterprise and, in some cases, passing ordinances that seem aimed at regulating personal use as much as possible.

Last year, to help everyone from pot consumers and would-be pot entrepreneurs to people who simply are curious about the progress of a new state law, we began gathering details on local marijuana policies. In January, we launched a database with some of that information, offering cannabis rules from about half the cities in the state. Today, we’ve upgraded that work, with rules from every city and county in California.

The information is included in our online database, where readers can search policies by location or by business type. And, based on an analysis of that data, we’ve ranked each community on our 100-point scale of marijuana friendliness.

The data reveals some interesting trends, conflicts and anomalies. It also shows that leaders in some communities are far less enthusiastic (or, in some cases, more enthusiastic) about cannabis than the residents who voted for or against Prop 64. That’s one reason the database shows city-by-city voting results, too.

Today’s story is the first in a three-part series. Next up is a story about how some city laws seem to paint cannabis as a barely-legal product, and after that will come a story about how a few cities are particularly eager to make money off the cannabis industry.

(Read Part 2 and Part 3)

We’ll continue exploring and expanding the data so, down the road, we can offer more insights about the multi-billion-dollar world of legal cannabis in California.

California hasn’t gone green

Many people seem to think it’s a free-for-all when it comes to cannabis in California now that recreational marijuana is legal. But that’s far from the case, as many cities are setting up strict rules on what types of cannabis businesses — if any — can open in their town.

And even the numbers that seem to indicate where the cannabis industry is being welcomed can paint an overly enthusiastic picture. A couple dozen cities on the chart — places such as Moreno Valley and Davis — have passed rules to allow marijuana businesses. But that data doesn’t show how those cities have yet to fully develop the regulations, or issue permits, to let those businesses start.

That’s why even though 61 cities and nine counties have ordinances on the books that allow recreational marijuana stores, as of April 6, 2018, the state Bureau of Cannabis Control had licensed recreational shops in only 34 cities and five unincorporated county areas of California.

Here’s a map of shops licensed to sell recreational cannabis.

Most cannabis-friendly cities in California

A couple dozen cities are leading the pack for the most points we’ve doled out so far, meaning they’re the most lenient cities in the state when it comes to cannabis policy.

(If the graphics with this story are unresponsive, refresh this page.)

Riverside County has by far the highest number of permissive cities, with six that score above 96 points on our scale. A few other counties have two 96-point cities each, including Los Angeles and Sonoma.

Four counties are also racking up points when it comes to their lenient policies for unincorporated areas: Humboldt, Inyo, Del Norte and Monterey.

To get above 96 points, cities and counties must allow every type of marijuana business licensed by the state. That means permitting medical and recreational licenses for cannabis sales, cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and testing. They would also have to allow their residents to grow marijuana at home, both indoors and outdoors.

No one yet has a score of 100 is because we reserved a few points in our scale for cities that go a step further and allow, say, cannabis lounges or festivals. We’ll be incorporating these factors as we continue to build out the database, with cities such as Palm Springs and San Francisco — which permit cannabis lounges — expected to jump even higher.

(Note: We don’t mean to imply that “high” scores are better or worse than “low” scores. If you support cannabis rights, you’ll likely see a high score as a good thing. If you oppose them, you’ll likely see a low score as preferable. Our scoring system is simply a mathematical way to compare city and county policies.)

Least cannabis-friendly cities in California

More than five dozen cities score a zero on our scale of cannabis friendliness.

These cities are spread over 26 counties. The highest number is predictably in the county with by far the most cities: Los Angeles. But just 19 percent of L.A. County cities are super strict on cannabis, while every city in the tiny counties of Madera and Sutter have passed the toughest rules possible.

Perhaps the biggest surprise is in Humboldt County, which is famous for cannabis production. Despite the region’s reputation as a cannabis hotbed, and despite having a couple cities where cannabis ordinances are lenient, four of the seven cities in Humboldt County earn zero points on our scale.

To get a zero score, a city has to ban all marijuana businesses, block residents from growing marijuana for personal use outdoors and require them to get a permit to grow it inside their homes.

County policies sometimes conflict with cities

So far, counties have been slightly more likely than cities to welcome marijuana businesses.

The gap is most pronounced when it comes to shops and cultivation. More than 15 percent of California counties allow recreational stores in unincorporated areas, for example, compared with 12 percent of cities. And 27 percent of counties allow medical marijuana cultivation, compared with just 20 percent of cities.

In some places, county policies contrast sharply with some of the rules passed by cities within that county.

Imperial County, for example, permits all types of marijuana businesses in its unincorporated areas, mostly near the Arizona and Mexico borders. Yet most cities in Imperial County (the three biggest are El Centro, Calexico and Brawley) have banned the industry, and none allow recreational shops.

There are also state-licensed marijuana stores that claim addresses in Carmel and Monterey, even though both of those cities block all marijuana businesses.

The shops are technically in unincorporated Monterey County, which allows all types of marijuana businesses. Same goes for a recreational shop “in Crescent City” that’s actually in unincorporated Del Norte County, and another with an address “in Fort Bragg” though it’s officially in unincorporated Mendocino County.

Local policies vs. voter wishes

In some cities and counties, cannabis industry rules contrast sharply with how residents there voted on Prop. 64.

In the top left corner of the chart you’ll find cities and counties where local leaders have passed liberal marijuana policies even though most of their constituents voted against Prop. 64.

Imperial County again stands out. Only 45 percent of unincorporated county residents there voted in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana. But the Imperial County Board of Supervisors voted in November to welcome every type of cannabis business, giving the area a score of 95.9 on our scale of permissiveness.

Oakdale and Riverbank, in Stanislaus County, are the only two cities in the state that welcome every type of recreational marijuana business even though a majority of residents in both cities voted against Prop. 64.

The opposite can be seen in the bottom right corner of the chart, which shows cities and counties where local leaders are sticking with strict cannabis policies even though more than two thirds of the voters in their communities were in favor of Prop. 64.

In Sausalito, in Marin County, 77 percent of voters supported legal weed, but city council members there have blocked all businesses and outdoor home gardens. The numbers are similar in the Bay Area city of Albany.

In other places, local policies are very much in line with voter wishes.

West Hollywood and Berkeley voters, for example, tied with a high of 83 percent of residents approving Prop. 64. Both cities also have liberal cannabis policies, just missing the leader board for most permissive cities in the state because they block commercial cultivation and other behind-the-scenes businesses.

Kingsburg, in Fresno County, also has policies that align with election numbers. Residents of the farming town opposed Prop. 64 more than anywhere else in California, with only 35 percent favoring marijuana legalization. And city council members have taken a similar stance, with policies that earn Kingsburg 0.5 out of 100 points on our scale of marijuana friendliness."
23,23,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/07/13/israeli-marijuana-researchers-to-open-first-u-s-clinic-in-laguna-woods/,Israeli marijuana researchers to open first U.S. clinic in Laguna Woods,"Israel has been, for decades, the global leader in medical marijuana research and treatment, with the government funding human clinical trials even as the United States and other countries discouraged or criminalized such studies.

Now, a company formed by doctors and nurses involved in some of Israel’s pioneering cannabis research is working to open its first American clinic in Laguna Woods.

Israel-based NiaMedic is promising to offer conventional medical care alongside what company leaders describe as research-backed cannabis treatment aimed at seniors. The focus will be on the use of cannabis to handle pain management, physical rehabilitation, insomnia and other conditions linked to aging.

“Right now, it’s scary to get older,” said Alon Blatt, NiaMedic’s director of business development. “We’re showing people that there’s a better way.”

The clinic is on track to open in late August, just outside the gates to Laguna Woods Village. Though an exact location isn’t nailed down, Blatt said they already have a list of roughly 100 local seniors hoping to sign on as patients.

“I’m very enthusiastic about this,” said Shari Horne, a Laguna Woods councilwoman who occasionally relies on medical marijuana.

“I think there’s so much potential.”

Ideal population

The demographics of Laguna Woods, and the community’s progressive stance on medical marijuana, make the age-restricted town an ideal setting for NiaMedic’s first U.S. clinic, according to Blatt.

Laguna Woods is an incorporated city, but one that’s comprised almost entirely of Laguna Woods Village, a gated retirement community. Home prices are comparatively affordable, amenities are abundant and the 16,400 residents make up one of America’s oldest communities — with a median age of about 75, according to Census data.

Since cannabis has been shown to effectively treat conditions that plague people in that age range — including certain types of chronic pain, spasms and appetite problems — people over 65 are one of the fastest-growing segments of cannabis consumers in the United States.

What’s more, cannabis already has something of a toe-hold in Laguna Woods.

In 2008, Laguna Woods became the first city in Orange County to pass an ordinance allowing medical marijuana dispensaries. But a lack of viable commercial space, and pressure from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, prevented a cannabis shop from ever opening in town. And in April 2017, the council reversed its rules, voting to block all marijuana-related businesses.

But over the years, hundreds of area residents have consumed cannabis through the Laguna Woods Medical Cannabis Club, a collective founded by a resident, Lonnie Painter, and staffed by volunteer “peer guides.” Members of the club, also known as a collective, have been able to get information about how to use medical marijuana and buy lab-tested cannabis products sourced by Painter.

However, because of new state laws related to cannabis, the collective will have to get a license to sell cannabis directly, or dissolve, by the end of 2018. Since Laguna Woods’ city ordinances no longer permits marijuana sales, it looks likes the town’s Cannabis Club will be defunct in less than six months.

New options needed

Paradoxically, Proposition 64 — which this year legalized recreational cannabis sales in California — establishes some guidelines that can make life trickier for some medical consumers.

As part of the law, Californians no longer need a doctor’s recommendation to buy cannabis. And, because of that, many doctors who used to meet with “patients” and offer up medical recommendations have been shutting down their practices.

Bud and Bloom, a licensed dispensary in Santa Ana, saw this problem as an opportunity. Last year, the company started sending a bus to Laguna Woods once a month, offering regular consumers and the merely curious a free ride to consult with cannabis experts and buy product from the Bud and Bloom shop on St. Gertrude Place.

But with the Laguna Woods collective scheduled to sunset, residents with serious medical conditions are afraid that, come January, they’ll face a gap when it comes to getting reliable information and access to cannabis.

Enter NiaMedic.

The company was co-founded by Inbal Sikorin, an Israeli nurse known internationally as an advocate for using cannabis to help geriatric patients deal with age-related conditions.

Early in her career, Sikorin opposed marijuana use. But the family of a patient in a nursing home outside Tel Aviv asked if Sikorin would consider using cannabis to help their mom, who was in constant pain and relied on a feeding tube. Sikorin said marijuana transformed that patient, and others in her care, and she quickly became a leading researcher on using cannabis to treat dementia, pain and other conditions. Her work has drawn interest from celebrity medical types such as TV host Montel Williams and neurosurgeon Dr. Sunjay Gupta.

Sikorin and partners launched NiaMedic two years ago as a way to bridge the gap between the mainstream medical world and the exploding cannabis industry. In Israel, two NiaMedic clinics have treated roughly 800 patients whose average age was 78.

While the hub for medical marijuana research remains Israel, Blatt notes the biggest market for cannabis is in the United States. So NiaMedic has set up its U.S. headquarters in West Hollywood and selected Laguna Woods for its first local facility.

Councilwoman Horne, among others, believes cannabis can help ease some forms of chronic pain and, therefore, could help ease the opioid epidemic that’s plaguing Laguna Woods and other U.S. communities.

“It’s not for everyone, or every medical condition,” Horne said of cannabis. But she added that she regularly hears from hears from residents who say cannabis works as an opioid substitute.

Without much regulated cannabis research in the United States, and with few doctors willing to offer advice on the drug’s potential uses, U.S. cannabis patients typically are left to experiment when it comes to products and doses. But Horne said one element of the NiaMedic model — a database with information from thousands of people treated by Sikorin and others — could be particularly helpful as a guide for local patients trying to sort out which type of cannabis to use for a particular condition.

Patients at the Laguna Woods clinic also will add to that research, since Blatt said they’ll monitor — without names — how treatment methods stack up against results.

How the clinic will work

NiaMedic will be staffed by doctors and nurses who focus on geriatrics, pain management, neurology, psychiatry and physical rehabilitation. While the clinic will cater to Laguna Woods seniors, Blatt said they’ll treat patients of any age, from any location. And cannabis will be “just one tool” in a broader toolbox.

A typical first visit will cost $350. Though that’s not currently covered by insurance (Blatt says they’re hoping to change that), the fee covers a full health assessment, a lengthy consultation, treatment planning and a month of routine monitoring.

Patients also can chose to become NiaMedic members. They’ll then pay $100 a month and $150 for each visit.

The fees won’t include the cannabis. Just as traditional medical clinics use pharmacies to dispense opioids or antibiotics, NiaMedic won’t sell cannabis directly to patients. Instead, Blatt said they’re developing partnerships with cannabis cultivators and manufacturers, and with area dispensaries, so they can send patients to stores that carry what they deem to be appropriate cannabis products.

While the company is developing the standalone clinic in Laguna Woods, Blatt said NiaMedic nurses trained in using cannabis to treat elderly patients will be placed Los Angeles area clinics. The company also plans to host educational seminars for patients and medical professionals, and to develop software that will suggest the best cannabis products and doses to treat different conditions.

The vision is big. But Blatt, a former investment banker, said it’s all aimed at helping seniors.

“The medical world has focused so much on prolonging life,” he said. “We want to improve the quality of that life.”"
24,24,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/07/05/marijuana-festivals-and-businesses-that-benefit-from-them-are-hurting-now-that-cannabis-is-legal-in-california/,"Marijuana festivals, and businesses that benefit from them, are hurting now that cannabis is legal in California","Marijuana festival organizers were banking on this to be their biggest year yet, now that recreational cannabis is legal in California and the state is legitimizing such events by licensing them for the first time.

Promoters say they planned to stop operating under the loose protections of the state’s medical marijuana laws, where they’d force attendees to get doctor’s recommendations for cannabis before entering the gates. Instead, they hoped to have licenses that would allow anyone 21 and older to buy and smoke cannabis, just like they can buy and drink beer at other festivals.

But with local authorities now able to block such festivals even from the limited venues where they’re permitted by new state rules, there weren’t any state-sanctioned events in Southern California during the first half of the year. And none are on the horizon for the rest of 2018.

The picture is a bit brighter in Northern California. The state licensed marijuana festivals this spring in Sacramento and in Santa Rosa, where the massive Emerald Cup is also expected to go off in December without a hitch.

“It’s costing us a lot of money, but it’s going to come back in the long run,” said Tim Blake, who founded The Emerald Cup festival and competition 15 years ago. “We’re going to really be teaching them how it should be done.”

But with many of California’s largest marijuana festivals – such as the now-postponed Chalice California in Victorville – unable to secure permits to allow consumption and sales, overall attendance and revenue for promoters, vendors and fairground venues is expected to be down significantly in the first year of legalization.

“We are taking a big hit,” said Franco Rodriguez, promoter of the High Life Music Festival, which got turned down for a marijuana sales permit by the city of San Bernardino. “Our own government is not letting the people do what we voted for.”

People who own hotels, restaurants and other businesses near these venues are also expressing concern. They say the boost they’ve seen as tens of thousands of people have flocked to these events in the past has helped them sustain and grow their operations.

A lawsuit over these festival rules is pending, while some organizers say they’re looking to move their events out of California.

Other festival promoters are taking the same approach as the rest of California’s still-massive black market. They’re citing a “crippling” permit system, lingering legal gray areas and delayed enforcement as justification to keep hosting events that make it look as though nothing has changed when it comes to marijuana laws in California – even though, officially, everything has.

Options limited

Festivals that let people buy and smoke marijuana are now legally restricted to fairground venues authorized by the Department of Food and Agriculture.

“There’s no other type of event to be limited to that,” Blake said. “It’s kind of ridiculous.”

Several of the state’s 80 sanctioned fairs are defunct or share facilities. Others – such as Santa Maria Fairpark, home to the Santa Barbara County Fair – can’t host cannabis events under state law because they’re within 600 feet of schools.

Carving out those properties leaves California with around 70 venues that can entertain the notion of permitting cannabis festivals. But the obstacles don’t end there.

Layers of permission required

For 20 years, medical marijuana festivals in California only needed permission from whoever owned or managed the event venue. But as of Jan. 1, companies that want to host festivals where cannabis can be sold and consumed must first get annual licenses from the state. Then, for every event they host, they need permission from the board that oversees the venue, from the city or county where the venue is located and again from the state.

Several fair boards, such as the ones that oversee OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa and Amador County Fairgrounds & Event Center near Sacramento, have opted to ban all cannabis-themed events.

“We just don’t think it is a good fit for us here in Amador County,” said Troy Bowers, chief executive for the Northern California venue.

The Department of Food Agriculture has recommended “that each fair board set local policy about cannabis events,” according to agency spokesman Steve Lyle. But managers for some facilities, including Tehama District Fairgrounds in Northern California, said they don’t have a policy because they haven’t yet been approached about holding marijuana events. Others say their city or county already prohibits all commercial cannabis activity, so they know festivals wouldn’t get local approval anyway.

“We have to abide by local rules and regulations,” said Dan Jacobs, general manager of the Antelope Valley Fair & Event Center in Lancaster, which blocks marijuana sales.

Only around 10 state-sanctioned fairground venues are in cities or counties that permit recreational marijuana sales, according to a database of local marijuana policies compiled by the Southern California News Group.

In at least two of those 10 communities, either the fair board or local authorities have already opted to block cannabis events. That leaves perhaps eight viable venues for hosting marijuana festivals in all of California, with several in remote communities far from the state’s population centers.

Organizers feel ‘big hit’

Getting turned down for marijuana consumption and sales permits is expected to mean a substantial drop in attendance, industry insiders say.

Attendees called High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup, held in San Bernardino in April, a “ghost town” after the city refused to sign off on the event at the last minute.

Chalice was slated to take place in Victorville from July 13-15, with shows by Ludacris and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on the ticket. But event producer Ryan Heil said he expected a 60 percent loss in revenue after the city said its ordinance bans cannabis sales at the event, which they said brought more than $33 million to the area last year. So on July 4, organizers announced they were postponing the event, with no word yet on when and where it will now take place.

Rodriguez said he expects to make at least 50 percent less money than he’d hoped when High Life comes to National Orange Show Events Center in September, since he was forced to make it an all-ages show with no cannabis sales allowed. They’re still telling adults 21 and older that they can bring their own marijuana to consume in a “cannabis garden.”

With fairgrounds in Humboldt County so far shutting them out, organizers of the Cannifest event are looking at potentially moving their operation to Pennsylvania or Ohio.

Other festival organizers – including the team behind Re-Up Festival 2.0 at National Orange Show Events Center this weekend – appear to be carrying on just like they did in previous years.

Re-Up Festival is promoting a “special 420 area” that will be open to anyone 18 and older with a doctor’s recommendation for medical marijuana. And they’re selling both “medicated” and “non-medicated” vendor packages, just as festival organizers did for years under California’s Proposition 215 medical marijuana law.

“I think there are still events happening that feel they’re operating under Prop. 215 rules,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control. He said that’s why his agency in April issued a notice letting people know sales are only allowed at licensed festivals by licensed vendors. The notice also says collectives that do business at festivals could face civil penalties for “unlicensed commercial cannabis activity.”

Lawsuit, new laws may expand options

Chalice organizers in June filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Cannabis Control and the city of Victorville after both entities refused to issue permits for the festival. The suit claims that Victorville shouldn’t have authority over the state-owned fairgrounds.

If Chalice wins the legal challenge, marijuana festivals could potentially take place at any of California’s 50 or so state-owned fairground venues even without approval from the local city or county.

Southern California festival organizers are hoping they might soon find a new home at the Lake Perris Fairgrounds. Riverside County is floating an ordinance that would permit festivals in unincorporated areas.

Assembly Bill 2020, proposed by Assemblyman Bill Quirk, D-Hayward, could also significantly increase the options by letting the state authorize cannabis events at any venue that has local approval. That would allow, say, the city of Los Angeles to permit marijuana-themed festivals even though there aren’t any fairgrounds in its boundaries.

Los Angeles appears to be banking on some such change to state law. The City Council on Tuesday approved placing a marijuana tax measure on the Nov. 6 ballot that includes a $5 surcharge for tickets to temporary cannabis events."

Failures have been triggered by inaccurate labeling or contamination from pesticides, bacteria or processing chemicals.

Those testing requirements and results have left some retailers with severely limited inventory over the past few weeks, as cultivators and product manufacturers scramble to get compliant products to market.

There was a big gap at the beginning of the month with the supply of marijuana buds in particular, according to Nick Rinella, chief operating officer of Verdant Distribution, a Long Beach-based independent cannabis distributor.

The new testing requirements have also created backlogs at busy labs.

The state has licensed just 31 testing labs, most located in Northern California, and many of them aren’t yet taking customers. As a result, Rinella said cannabis safety tests are taking between one and two weeks.

And this week the first cannabis product was recalled from store shelves because it doesn’t meet new standards regarding pesticide levels.

While that’s concerning, in the short term, industry experts believe it’s also a sign that California’s cannabis industry is maturing and starting to look like other regulated markets, such as alcohol and food.

Wrong labels

California launched legal recreational marijuana sales and imposed new rules for the cannabis industry on New Years Day. But state regulators gave businesses a six-month grace period to comply with some rules, including a requirement that they could only sell products that had been tested for safety by a licensed lab.

That grace period ended July 1, and the state says since then labs have tested 5,268 batches of marijuana, about 20 percent of which failed to meet state standards.

Those numbers would likely be higher if companies weren’t paying for independent lab tests before putting their products through the official supply chain, according to Verdant Distribution founder Brian Blatz.

“Smart brands are pretesting first, then testing again in the labs,” he said.

More than two thirds (68 percent) of the cannabis batches that failed in state tests did so because of inaccurate claims on the labels. Specifically, labels often over-state the amount of THC — the compound in cannabis that makes people feel high — that’s actually in the cannabis, according to Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso.

While that’s not necessarily a safety hazard, it can lead consumers to overpay for products that aren’t as strong as advertised.

Pesticides trigger recall

Nearly one in five of the failed tests (19 percent) were related to pesticides. In some cases, the cannabis tested for traces of pesticides that are totally forbidden; in others, it tested with higher levels of pesticides than the amount deemed safe by state law.

Los Angeles-based company The Bloom Brand announced Wednesday it was recalling four vaporizer cartridges with cannabis oil that doesn’t meet state standards for safe levels of the pesticide Myclobutanil.The fungicide is commonly used on food crops, such as grapes and almonds, but is believed to be unsafe when heated — a process that’s common for marijuana smokers.

The Bloom Brand cartridges were sold to 100 stores throughout the state between July 1-19. It’s not yet clear how the products got to market after July 1 with unsafe levels of Myclobutanil.

“We are working closely with (state cannabis officials) to remedy this issue and expect clean, compliant products to be back on shelves in three weeks,” the company said in a press release.

Some marijuana is testing positive for pesticides that cultivators never used, according to Micah Anderson, president of the Southern California Responsible Growers Council, a cannabis trade group. He said product from several growers who’ve taken over former vineyards, for example, failed initial tests because the soil was contaminated, with stricter limits on pesticides allowed in marijuana than in wine.

“For growers, this will definitively be the biggest challenge they face,” said Cliff Yeh, co-founder of Encore Labs, a cannabis testing center in Pasadena.

There are 60-plus banned or regulated pesticides. Growers can pass the majority of the limits on the pesticide guidelines, Yeh said, but if they fail on a few the whole batch is considered a failure.

Other contaminants

Around 6 percent of lab test failures since July 1 have been due to microbial impurities, such as mold and bacteria. The most common microbes showing up are the fungus aspergillus and the bacteria e.coli and salmonella, all of which can develop in marijuana if it isn’t properly stored with careful controls for humidity.

Another 5 percent of failed marijuana samples have involved concentrated waxes and oils that tested positive for residual solvents, such as ethanol, butane and isopropanol. Those chemicals are used to extract THC and other active ingredients from marijuana plants.

Some additional marijuana testing requirements will be phased in Dec. 31.

Starting in 2019, all marijuana products will need to be tested for heavy metals and mycotoxins, toxic substances that can come from mold. Products will also need to be tested for levels of terpenoids, the organic chemicals that give marijuana its distinct aroma and play a role in its effects. And marijuana-infused edibles will have to be tested for moisture content, to make sure they’re not breeding grounds for bacteria and mold.

And more as yet unspecified adjustments are expected, with the state still crafting permanent industry regulations. But just three weeks after the latest testing requirements took affect, Rinella said shelves at marijuana shops are starting to fill back up with product deemed safe for consumers.

Profit margins for most licensed cannabis companies remain thin as they struggle to make it through turbulence that comes when a gray market is fully legalized, Blatz said. But the producers that do survive are competing to see who will be the first Anheuser-Busch of cannabis.

“Because the market is still maturing, there’s not really brand loyalty yet,” he said. “But it’s coming.”"
26,26,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/27/la-palma-city-council-drops-idea-of-allowing-some-marijuana-related-businesses/,La Palma City Council drops idea of allowing some marijuana-related businesses,"La Palma might be small, but its citizens were loud and clear Tuesday night: They don’t want their city to become what one resident described as “the pot capital of northwest Orange County.”

Citizens overflowed the City Council Chambers, some having to sit in an adjoining room, to oppose changing city laws to allow some cannabis-related businesses. Many residents learned of the meeting from flyers left on their doorsteps, calling them to the meeting to voice their opinions.

Council members said they heard the residents’ opinions and agreed to not pursue changes to La Palma’s current ban on the commercial cultivation, warehousing, delivery, testing and sale of marijuana in town.

If the city later needs a new source of revenue the conversation could be revisited, Mayor Gerard Goedhart said at the end of the meeting, but it is off the table for now. Council members were clear they weren’t interested in dispensaries.

“The public paid me to teach kids to say no to drugs. I can see a teacher in 2019 trying to teach kids to say no to drugs and a kid says, ‘Well, wait. La Palma makes drugs,’” Jeanne Culver, a resident and long-time teacher, said. “What kind of message are we telling our children?”

Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and La Habra are the only Orange County cities to allow any marijuana-related businesses, Santa Ana is the only allowing dispensaries.

Residents also asked the City Council that if the issue comes back up to put the decision to voters on a ballot, instead of having the elected leaders make the call.

“Why would you do something that runs against the people of La Palma?” Carlos Alcaino asked council members, referencing the 57 percent of La Palma voters who opposed Proposition 64. “We said in 2016 that we didn’t want it.”

City Manager Laurie Murray said the discussion came about as a “business decision” to diversify city revenues and protect La Palma’s financial stability in the event another major tax provider leaves the city. La Palma residents approved a 1 cent sales tax increase after facing a $772,000 budget deficit in 2016. Estimates were marijuana-related businesses could net the city “anywhere from $500,000 to 1.2 million” annually in revenue.

Murray added staff members also broached the question because there seemed to be a “paradigm shift” in opinion regarding cannabis, referencing the recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a cannabis-based drug treatment for epilepsy and recommendations to the Drug Enforcement Agency to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug in response.

“Right now, we’re not ready,” Goedhart said. “The controversy isn’t something we need right now.”"

SAN RAFAEL, Calif. - For as long as most residents can remember, smoking marijuana has been a part of life here. The fact that California legalized the practice in January went practically unnoticed in this quiet town a half-hour's drive north of San Francisco, where some say the normalization of America's marijuana culture got its start.

For Quintin Pohl and other teenagers before him, smoking pot was a rite of passage. It was a diversion from the loneliness he felt at home when his parents were splitting up and a salve for middle-school angst. It was his entire social life in seventh and eighth grades, he said, when social life is everything.

Even though nearly all his friends were using marijuana and seeming to enjoy it, Pohl said, at some point his marijuana use took a turn he never saw coming: He became addicted.

Many people are unaware of marijuana addiction. But in the public health and medical communities, it is a well-defined disorder that includes physical withdrawal symptoms, cravings and psychological dependence. Many say it is on the rise, perhaps because of the increasing potency of genetically engineered plants and the use of concentrated products, or because more users are partaking multiple times a day.

""There should be no controversy about the existence of marijuana addiction,"" said David Smith, a physician who has been treating addiction since he opened a free clinic in San Francisco's drug-drenched Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the 1960s. ""We see it every day. The controversy should be why it appears to be affecting more people.""

Although estimates of the number of people who use marijuana vary, the federal government and the marijuana industry tend to agree that total marijuana use has remained relatively constant over the past decade. Increased use in the past three years has been slight, despite increased commercial availability in states that have legalized it.

The percentage of people who become addicted to marijuana - estimated at about 9 percent of all users, and about 17 percent of those who start in adolescence - also has been stable. Some studies report that even higher proportions of marijuana users develop a dependence, which means they experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the drug.

Yet here in Northern California, some addiction treatment practitioners say they're seeing a surge in demand for help, particularly among adolescents.

Marijuana's estimated rate of addiction is lower than that of cocaine and alcohol (15 percent) and heroin (24 percent). Unlike with opioids and stimulants, marijuana dependence tends to develop slowly: Months or years may pass before symptoms begin to affect a dependent user's life.

There are no known reports of anyone dying of a marijuana overdose or of the drug's common withdrawal symptoms: chills, sweats, cravings, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, anxiety and irritability.

According to Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, an estimated 2.7 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for marijuana dependence, second only to alcohol dependence.

Smith, a visiting physician at Muir Wood Adolescent and Family Services, a treatment center for boys where Pohl eventually got help, speculates that the potency of today's pot is causing a higher prevalence of problematic marijuana use.

""Back in the day when kids were sitting around smoking a joint, the THC levels found in marijuana averaged from 2 to 4 percent,"" Smith said. ""That's what most parents think is going on today. And that's why society thinks marijuana is harmless.""

But selective breeding has resulted in an average potency of 20 percent THC, the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana. Some strains exceed 30 percent.

Marijuana concentrates and extracts, much more commonly used in the past five years, have THC levels that range from 40 percent to more than 80 percent, according to marijuana industry promotional information and Drug Enforcement Administration reports.

Susan Weiss, who directs research on the health effects of marijuana at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, told a group of addiction doctors at the annual meeting of the American Society of Addiction Medicine in April that the federal government is trying to get the message out that marijuana can be addictive.

""But believe it or not,"" she told the group, ""we're having a hard time convincing people that addiction exists.""

The National Cannabis Industry Association's chief spokesman, Morgan Fox, said he's not surprised the federal government is having a hard time convincing the public that marijuana can be addictive.

""It's their own fault,"" he said of the government. ""When people find out they've been lied to by the federal government about the relative harms of marijuana for decades, they are much less likely to believe anything they have to say going forward, even if that information is accurate.""

Fox said his organization has no disagreement with the finding that about 9 percent of people who use marijuana become addicted, and his organization urges its members to make that clear in their marketing information. But he disagrees that more-potent forms of marijuana may be causing an increase in addiction. ""It just means people need to consume less to achieve the desired effect,"" he said.

So far, no scientific studies have shown that stronger pot increases the likelihood of addiction, and large swaths of the general public continue to question the existence of marijuana addiction. But for Quintin Pohl, addiction was real.

Pohl said his marijuana addiction took years to develop. His mother, Kimberly Thomas, said that once she realized her son was using marijuana frequently, ""it was like a roller coaster chugging uphill, chugging, chugging, chugging. You know something is happening,"" she said, ""and then just within a couple of days, you reach the peak and zoom downhill. It was awful, awful.""

Scott Sowle, executive director of the Muir Wood rehabilitation center, said he gets the same call from parents nearly every day.

""They call and say, 'My 16-year-old son was doing really well in school. He was interested in sports and involved in extracurricular activities. But suddenly, he's just not the same kid anymore.' ""

Pohl recalled that he drank a little, off and on, but that marijuana was his constant obsession. After middle school, he got involved in rowing for a couple of years and took a break from his group of marijuana friends. But after he decided competitive rowing wasn't for him, Pohl said he started smoking pot again, this time with new friends who smoked all the time.

And then the roller coaster plunged.

His grades plummeted. He stopped going home most of the time and was couch surfing for a while. Finally, he said, his mom called the police on him for stealing her car. ""At that point, I was heartless, emotionless,"" he said. ""I was just kind of a blob taking up space. I was baked 24/7.""

Pohl's mother said she saw that he was in trouble and demanded that he stay at home every moment he wasn't in school. (Pohl's father was living in San Francisco.)

""She told me to come back home. So I did,"" Pohl said. ""At the time, I wasn't sure why she did that. I was still in that whole miserable phase, smoking at least an ounce of weed a week - two ounces on a good week."" (One ounce is enough to smoke four to eight joints every day for a week, depending on their size.)

Then early one morning before school, Pohl recalled, two private investigators his mother had hired appeared and took him to Muir Wood.

Pohl said he went through a week of pure misery at the rehab center: angry, in denial and suffering. ""I couldn't sleep for a week. I was cold, and then I was sweating. I hated everything,"" he said. ""And then the sun hit my face one morning, and it felt great. Things tasted good, smelled better, everything was just enhanced.""

During his six weeks there, Pohl took intensive classes with about 10 other boys and talked to his therapist frequently. His mother spent eight hours a week there, attending parent classes, sharing meals with her son and working with him and his therapist to address the underlying issues that had led him to self-medicate with marijuana.

Pohl says he hasn't smoked marijuana since he left Muir Wood last July. For the rest of the summer and after school in the fall, he attended classes at a Muir Wood outpatient clinic in San Rafael.

Wearing black pants, a black sweatshirt and a pink skull cap on a cool but sunny day in late May, Pohl smiles broadly when he talks about his future. After his June graduation, he says, he plans to start working full time at the grocery store where he's had a part-time job for the last year.

He's thinks he can start smoking marijuana again some day - socially, when he's an adult.

Tens of millions of Americans are expected to clock out and spark up for the global cannabis holiday today known as 4/20. That includes about 15,000 in Golden Gate Park's Robin Williams Meadow, the site of so-called Hippie Hill and the second annual licensed 4/20 gathering.

The term ""420"" has evolved from a code for ""time to toke up"" among Northern California high school students in the late 1970s, to a marijuana subcultural meme, to a global rallying cry for cannabis-user liberation.

We talked to 10 noted growers, activists, retailers, and experts about 420's meaning to them on the eve of the first 4/20 with commercial legalization in California.

1) Has 420 lost its meaning now that cannabis is legal?

""NO. After all, it's still illegal to smoke pot in [Golden Gate] Park."" — Dale Gieringer, director, California NORML.

""No! It is only further legitimized. My wife sent me an email blast earlier today from a mainstream online clothing retailer who is doing 20% off their entire site on 4/20. I think it's great that we dedicate at least one day a year to globally celebrate this amazing plant. We cannabis users deserve a national holiday and now we have it!"" — Aaron Justis, President, Buds & Roses.

""Not at all. ... We just need more public venues to party in style. That will require a change of the regulations, but we will get there."" — Mikki Norris, East Bay activist.

""For the longest time, nobody knew what the mysterious 420 stood for anyway ... until High Times revealed its secret. Then, after Senate Bill 420 was enacted, the number became enshrined in the broader vernacular. So I don't think it's lost its significance at all."" — Chris Conrad, East Bay activist.

""Absolutely not! It will only get more popular - I expect Hallmark will have 420 greeting cards soon."" — Nikki Lastreto, Swami Select Farms.

""Hell no, it's just becoming the St. Patrick's Day of weed, but greener and safer."" — Jane West, CEO of the Jane West cannabis lifestyle brand.

""Absolutely not. Adult sales will offer an entrance to the Willy Wonka Factory (cannabis retailers) for an entirely new segment, that were not medical patients or refused to identify as."" — Keith Stephenson, Purple Heart Patient Center.

""In fact, you can think about 4/20 like the Super Bowl (or Mardi Gras) of cannabis."" — Jamie Warm, CEO, Henry's Original.

Now Playing:

2) Is the significance of the ""holiday"" enhanced or diminished by the fact that the code word for something that was once taboo is no longer taboo and how basically any secrecy has long since passed in the era where huge crowds show up to Hippie Hill?

""Cannabis is only legal in eight states so far, with limited medical exemptions in another 21, so 420 may have lost its significance as far as being a 'secret' code but, to the extent that cannabis consumers federally and in most states still need a secret code to illegally share this pastime, the taboo is real."" — Conrad

""It's true that the subversive aspect of the 420 code is long gone. It's no longer being used to quietly signal 'it's time to sneak away to smoke pot' anymore, unless maybe you are in the midwest in a room full of senior citizens. Instead, it has morphed into a day of celebration, where we get together to proudly celebrate the fact that prohibition is finally ending. ... 420 forever!"" — Debbie Goldsberry, operator, Magnolia Wellness

""It's enhanced as more people are looking forward to this epic day. There's still sworn secrecy, as casual consumers do not always want everyone to know their personal business."" — Stephenson

""Is cannabis 'no longer taboo'? Depends on who you're talking too, even though we have made huge steps forward, it amazes me that some people still live in the dark ages."" — Mario Sherbinski, founder of Sherbinskis cannabis

""With legalization and lower dosed products, I think 4/20 has moved away from being a holiday to being more of a lifestyle or integration into every day life. I think every day is now 4/20."" — Clement Kwan, co-founder of Beboe

""The vast majority of the world still cannot consume this plant and thousands are still locked up because of it. The hippie's can't stop yet, as Jack Herer once told me, and many others, 'We cannot stop until ALL POT PRISONERS ARE SET FREE!!'"" — Justis

""It remains taboo for millions of workers and people on government jobs."" — Gieringer

""Legalization brings new consumers, so I would say enhanced. Our industry is growing so rapidly. More people learn about 420 every day, and it means something different to each person, depending on their age, where they grew up, and how important cannabis is to them."" — 'Hitman Dougie' Dracup, Hitman Glass

""Let us not forget that cannabis is still federally illegal, mothers cannot safely give their kids CBD oil and many counties have placed bans on cannabis cultivation and sales. The fight has only just begun."" — Madrone Stewart, author of Feminist Weed Farmer: Growing Mindful Medicine in Your Own Back Yard

""The stigma is not gone yet, but we are working on it though education. We live in a bubble in California, especially up here in Mendocino, but if this were Louisiana ..."" — Lastreto.

""I wouldn't say that it's enhanced or diminished. I think we went beyond that long before cannabis was legal this year."" — Daniel Stein, EVB, Oakland

""It may have lost its secrecy but there's a lot to celebrate with the end of prohibition."" — West

3) Is 420 still used as a code word at all?

""Absolutely."" — Gieringer

""Not really. I remember when my kids first 'discovered' 420 in middle school (probably from a Seth Rogen movie). They thought they were on to something that their parents didn't know about. Little did they know..."" — Stein

""It's morphed from code word to symbol. 420 means freedom. You say it and cheer."" — Goldsberry

""Just to refer to 'weed stuff,' as far as I can tell."" — West

""Amongst our circles, we don't hear people using that as a code word at all anymore. I think with the many lower dosage products, it's no longer an event or ritual to consume as its incorporated so seamlessly into every day life."" — Kwan

""I don't think it's used as a code word as much as an excuse to smoke herb, because it's 420, haha!"" — Sherbinski

""YES, it's still code for 'want to get high?'. Being legal just means more people will use it and know what it means!"" — Lastreto

""Yes. People in Humboldt use 420 to advertise properties that are set up for cannabis cultivation."" — Stewart

""Yes. We always notice when it's 4:20 and start thinking it's time to light one up. When an ad or someone says something is '420-friendly,' it means that people allow or are open to cannabis use."" — Norris

""I don't personally use it, but people use it regularly."" — Dracup

4) How will you observe 4/20?

""It's my birthday. I celebrate by taking a vacation from all MJ business."" — Gieringer

""I'll probably stay home on my boat and relax. I don't like crowds."" — Stewart

""I will be attending a 40 0z. Van party in LA."" — Sherbinski

""We'll treat it like your average Friday. We as a brand have found that Mother's Day and the week leading up to it has really been our ""4/20"". — Kwan

""Smoking out at Earth Day with my lovely wife, Mikki Norris."" — Conrad

""We are throwing a big party to celebrate 4/20 at Magnolia Wellness, with a marijuana farmers market, music, and vape samples in our consumption lounge. We are also auditioning for Shark Tank that morning. That is going to be so fun!"" — Goldsberry

5) How should 4/20 (4:20) be observed?

""The best way to observe 4/20 is to be with lots of other cannabis consumers, sharing a joint or sacrament, listening to music, dancing, having great conversations, or enjoying some food — all the things cannabis enhances for us. It's up to you about the daily observance of 4:20. Sometimes, when you still have a lot of work to do, it may be better to light up at 6:20 or 8:40 (two 420s). But, if you are done with your responsibilities, then observing 4:20 by smoking cannabis and taking a nice walk to enjoy nature is a wonderful thing to do."" — Norris

""Daily!"" — Stewart Stinson, general manager of TheWEED.

""Of course! We also like to honor 2:15 (in honor of Proposition 215) — and you could consider Proposition 64 to be 4 minutes after every hour ... in other words, it is always time for 4:20! — Lastreto

""It should be celebrated in every time zone, so you can smoke cannabis with people all around the world. It's 4:20 somewhere, at least 48 times a day."" — Goldsberry

""To be proper, in the wee hours of the morning."" — Gieringer

""4:20 kicks off the end of my work day. I like to call it 'flower hour,' and I use cannabis to unwind and clear my head of business and busy-ness. This isn't meant to be 'cute.' For real: happy hour is a culturally accepted daily routine where people consume intoxicants in bars and restaurants. How is sparking up at 4:20 at the end of a long workday any different?"" — West

""Responsibly, in moderation and within the confines of an approved space."" — Stephenson

""420 is one of those magical things that can take the shape of a time, date, dollar amount, address, etc. Every time I see it pop up, it makes me stop and smile. Maybe that is how it should be observed."" — Stein

""I like to observe 4:20 when I can. The magic of 4:20 is to light up at the same time you know that thousands of other people are doing exactly the same thing. It creates a virtual community — we don't have to see or hear or even know each other but we know that we all share this moment with cannabis and honor it with high honor. That feels pretty good."" — Conrad

""For all that care to unite and light, 420 is still and always will be our time! — Sherbinski"

This article appeared on KSBW.

A huge fire broke out just after 4:20 p.m. Monday at a marijuana growing operation in Greenfield, about an hour's drive from Monterey.

Videos sent to KSBW by Greenfield residents show several greenhouses on fire that are used for cultivating cannabis.

The property at 900 Cherry Avenue is operated by Greenfield's largest employer, Loudpack Farms.

At least 300 people work at the cannabis facility. Dispatchers said employees were evacuated, and no injuries have been reported.

Witness Delia Gonzales said, ""A marijuana company is up in smoke.""

""The Greenfield Fire Department and Soledad Fire Department are on the scene of multiple greenhouse structures on fire at 900 Cherry Avenue in the City of Greenfield. The on-scene Incident Commander is now requesting three additional engines from Gonzales, CTF, and King City,"" Fire Service of the Central Coast wrote on Facebook.

Witnesses posted photos on social media of thick black smoke billowing into a blue sky."

Six months after marijuana was legalized, new safety and regulation laws take effect Sunday, and some Sacramento dispensaries are rushing to clear inventory that will no longer be salable come Sunday, July 1.

The deadline marks the end of a six-month transition window before new labeling, packaging and product testing requirements take hold.

Starting Sunday, products must pass additional checks for pesticides, chemicals and foreign material, according to the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. Dispensaries are required to destroy any marijuana goods out of compliance starting Sunday.

Employees at A Therapeutic Alternative in Sacramento said that 60 percent of their inventory is on clearance until the end of the month and will be pulled from shelves July 1, due to the changes in product regulations and licensing of their suppliers.

Staff had a positive spin on the retail crunch and urged potential buyers to make the most of the window, saying that products are discounted down to prices that they don’t plan to offer in the future.

Following strict advertising and communications laws, A Therapeutic Alternative could only publicize their menu featuring sale products and prices inside the dispensary, on their website and on sites for visitors 21 and older.

In July, A Therapeutic Alternative executive director Kimberly Cargile said that the dispensary's selection will thin out as noncompliant products get taken off the shelf, but Cargile expects many of her suppliers to be back in business once they’ve caught up with testing and packaging requirements.

On Saturday, A Therapeutic Alternative will give away any remaining clearance products to anyone with a state-issued medical marijuana ID card.

On Sunday, all remaining noncompliant inventory will be turned over to cannabis waste hauling services. The unsellable marijuana products will be quarantined for 72 hours, mixed with shredded paper and water and sent to a landfill.

Despite losing inventory, Cargile said she is a strong proponent of the regulations.

“These regulations are very necessary for consumer protections, environmental protection and public safety protections, so they are good and we support them,” said Cargile.





“However it's more difficult to operate within a regulated market and more difficult than we anticipated.”"
33,33,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article214224109.html,Is your favorite dispensary out of marijuana? Blame this new state regulation | The Sacramento Bee,"A newly-enacted state ordinance regulating cannabis products has forced multiple area dispensaries to close while others make do with a limited selection.

Sunday marked the end of California dispensaries' grace period before new restrictions on THC limits, packaging and labeling took effect. The state Bureau of Cannabis Control mandated the destruction of all improperly labeled or overly strong products by July 1, leading to steep clearance sales at the end of June as up to $500 million worth of marijuana was predicted to be destroyed statewide.

The new regulations were approved as part of recreational marijuana's statewide legalization in November 2016 under Proposition 64, and required cannabis products to first be tested at state-certified labs starting on July 1 of this year before they can be sold. Such labs can be hard to find and are in high demand, said Shayna Schonauer, the Sacramento regional manager for Metro Cannabis Co.

While Metro Cannabis Co. has a good amount of marijuana buds available, edibles and concentrate have been harder to come by. That won't change anytime soon, she said.

""We're doing the best we can, but we're basically at the state's mercy in terms of being compliant,"" Schonauer said. ""It's going to be a little while before you see that rush of product.""

At Valley Health Options, ordinarily open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. near the intersection of Auburn Boulevard and El Camino Avenue, two security guards turned customers away on Monday afternoon and said the store would be closed through the end of the week. A guard confirmed the closure was related to the new regulation and said Valley Health's owner had been in and out of the building throughout the morning.

Turlock-based Dry Lake Wellness was also closed Monday despite normally being open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., though Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso said they were an unlicensed dispensary. Other dispensaries such as A Therapeutic Alternative gave their non-compliant substances away free to customers Saturday to avoid handing them over the next day to specialty waste hauling services that would lock buds and pre-rolled joints in compost bins and deposit crushed cartridges in landfills.

A California Cannabis Industry Association spokesman told Wired he expected four tons of marijuana to be destroyed in the Sacramento area alone. Steep discounts led to record sales on June 29 and June 30 at Green Solutions, manager Justin Robertson said, as dispensaries attempted to make some money back on their inventory.

Green Solutions previously ordered bulk shipments of buds from distributors and packaged them into various weights down to individual grams in a back room. Distributors now have to do the final packaging under the new regulations, Robertson said, and Green Solutions hasn't found one willing to spend the time and money on shipping small quantities of weed.

Prices have risen at Robertson's store due to having an ""enforced middleman"" making child-proof containers instead of the typical mylar bags he bought and filled in the back, and about one in five customers came in looking for their usual items Monday only to find them unavailable. Some forms of cannabis were especially hard to come by: Green Solutions had just one type of concentrate in stock instead of the usual 15.

Still, Robertson wasn't convinced the extra oversight would ultimately be bad for business. It's better to have top-grade product in the long run, he said, even if the initial transition is rocky for low-budget customers.

""(People are) guaranteed to get a certain product now, compared to before when the quality could vary,"" he said. ""(The change is) bad for people's wallets, but good for their lungs."""

They are ""guard dogs,"" seized from illegal pot operations, and they are filling up the already overburdened shelter.

Within the past week, at least 10 dogs guarding properties that police have identified as marijuana ""grow houses"" have been transferred to Front Street. Eight are German shepherds or shepherd mixes, which authorities said seem to be a favored breed among illegal pot growers.

This year, the city began collecting data on dogs brought to the shelter from suspected unlicensed pot houses, said chief animal control officer Jace Huggins. During the first six months, animal control officers have picked up about 70 dogs that police said were tied to those operations, he said.

""Unfortunately, it's almost a weekly occurrence for us these days,"" Huggins said.

Although the city has no comparative figures, ""I really do think we're seeing more than we have in the past,"" he said. Huggins speculated that California's legalization of recreational and medical marijuana may have emboldened criminals to launch illegal residential grow houses in an effort to ""make some easy money.""

Illegal grow house operators use large, strong dogs to protect their wares, Huggins said. The animals are not treated as pets.

""Most of these houses are not lived in,"" he said. ""The product is grown in them, and the dogs are used as security. They live outside and get the bare minimum of food and water, and they usually are not socialized. They can be very aggressive.""

Staffers at Front Street evaluate each of the animals for behavioral issues and their potential for adoption success, said shelter manager Gina Knepp.

""Some of them are beautiful animals and good dogs,"" she said. But because of their backgrounds and temperaments, they may never make it out of the shelter alive.

Janna Haynes, a spokeswoman for the county's Bradshaw Animal Shelter, said that facility receives far fewer guard dogs from criminal pot operations than the city is reporting.

""Occasionally we get dogs in here associated with a drug situation,"" she said. ""We did get three this past weekend.

""However, we've found the majority of these dogs to be somewhat sociable and good candidates for our behavior rehab program,"" she said. ""We have a lot of dogs that come in less than perfectly adoptable that emerge as great pets after some work.""

Last week, the city shelter, already jammed with an overabundance of homeless dogs and cats, took charge of seven large canines that police said were guarding marijuana houses in south Sacramento.

The Sacramento Police Department served search warrants on two homes in the area, neither of which appeared to be occupied, said spokesman Sgt. Vance Chandler. Four German shepherds were guarding one of the houses. At the other, a Mastiff and two mixed breed dogs patrolled the property.

Because the city shelter was at capacity, animal control officers left the dogs at the homes and visited them daily to make sure they were properly fed and watered, said Huggins. They since have been transferred to Front Street. Authorities seized three more shepherds in similar circumstances on Tuesday.

Despite the shelter's efforts, no one has come forward to claim the dogs. No arrests have been made in the cases, said Chandler.

On Tuesday afternoon, the ""guard dogs"" and many others awaited their fate at Front Street. At least 14 German shepherds were scattered among the pit bull terriers, chihuahuas and others that occupied row after row of kennels, barking and gazing at visitors.

Shepherds now are among the most common breed of dog that winds up at the shelter, said Knepp. During the first six months of 2017, the shelter took in 229 of the dogs. Through June 23 of this year, 331 had been impounded.

""Certainly, I won't attribute all of it to marijuana grow houses,"" she said. ""But one has to wonder how much of that might be true.""

Sacramento County animal control officer Mechelle Crites said that facility’s population of German shepherds also has soared recently.

""Our intake of shepherds definitely is higher in the last year or so,” she said. “I can’t say why that is the case. “It’s kind of like a wave. We had the pit bull wave. Now it’s a shepherd wave.

""It could be word of mouth that they make better guard dogs than pit bulls. Pit bulls can be unreliable as guard dogs. They can be real sissies.""

German shepherds are widely coveted as ""protection animals"" because of their intelligence and strength, according to animal experts. The booming marijuana trade has spawned businesses that train shepherds specifically as ""cannabis security dogs.""

""We understand the unique security needs surrounding the cannabis industry, and work closely with our clientele to provide them protection dogs that fit those needs,"" reads an online advertisement for one company, Forged K9, which features pictures of shepherds. ""From protecting a large cannabis grow operation to transporting produce or dispensary security, our dogs become your eyes and ears, as well as a trusted and beloved member of your family.""

It is highly doubtful that the ""pot dogs"" now lingering at Front Street were viewed as family, said Huggins.

""Unfortunately, most of them just are not very people friendly because of the lives that they've led,"" he said. ""Through no fault of their own, many of them just are not capable of being pets."""

Everado Cuadro Campos, 49, who is from Michoacan, Mexico, was arrested July 17 at a “marijuana garden” in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Shasta County, according to a news release by the United States Department of Justice.

U.S. Forest Service and California Department of Fish and Wildlife agents found a marijuana cultivation site near Rock Creek, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint, and entered through a “well-worn” path. A Forest Service special agent noticed plastic water lines that diverted water from a drainage area of the nearby creek.

The piping led the agents to a campsite, where a rifle, homemade spear, and knives were found, the complaint said. Agents followed the trail down to marijuana growth site, where they heard footsteps and Campos appeared, though he ran as soon as he saw the agents, the complaint said.

Campos was chased by a California Department of Fish and Wildlife dog who stopped him, and officers arrested him, the complaint said.

Campos said that he was hired by a “co-conspirator who eluded apprehension at the time of his arrest,” according to the complaint. Agents removed 2,079 marijuana plants from the farm.

Campos faces at least 10 years in prison and a $10 million fine for the marijuana manufacturing and distribution charges, if convicted. Charges for environmental crimes carry a penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Campos was found guilty of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver in Iowa in 1995, court documents show. During his trial for that incident, it was found that he was not a legal resident of the United States. Campos was deported after spending “no more than” 5 years in custody.

The same court document said that Campos had been discovered in the United States again in 2005 and was sent back to Mexico.

Despite the objections of the City Council member whose district represents the Cal Expo fairgrounds, the council approved a one-time license for marijuana consumption at the facility at this weekend’s Cannabis Cup festival.

By a 6-2 vote, the council approved a permit for on-site consumption and sales of marijuana at the Cannabis Cup on Friday and Saturday. Councilman Jeff Harris, whose district covers Cal Expo, and Councilwoman Angelique Ashby were the lone “no” votes. This will be the first permitted event for on-site consumption in the state since recreational use has been allowed.

Harris said the city has tried to adopt marijuana policy “slowly and methodically and transparently.” But he said he was not made aware of the Cannabis Cup request for on-site consumption until 12 days ago and that the council has not debated the broader topic of public consumption of marijuana.

“I don’t think we’re ready for this type of event in Sacramento,” he said. “We’ve never had a conversation about adult use in public. This is a big conversation to have.”

The state has the authority to allow on-site marijuana consumption at events on fairgrounds, but only if the local government approves the request.

Adam Levin, CEO of High Times, which is operating the festival, said the company thought it had the proper approvals prior to last week. “Unfortunately we came up in error,” he said. “And we worked to rectify the situation.”

Joe Devlin, the city’s chief of cannabis policy, said the event would generate more than $200,000 in local tax revenue. He said High Times had developed a “comprehensive security plan” that was approved by law enforcement and had organized a ride share program for those attending the festival.

High Times “has a distinguished track record of hosting safe, successful and compliant cannabis events,” Devlin said.





The musical lineup for Cannabis Cup includes acclaimed artists, including Hill, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Rich The Kid, Cypress Hill, Rick Ross and Ludacris. The festival is expected to draw 15,000 visitors.

Councilman Jay Schenirer acknowledged that the city would have already debated the broader policy of on-site consumption at events “in a perfect world,” but that he doesn’t expect that debate to occur for a while.

Schenirer said he supported the license because of the financial impact the event will have, saying the $200,000 tax windfall “honestly is very attractive to me because of the needs of the city.”"
39,39,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article194066459.html,Sacramento dispensaries say pot legalization has led to supply shortages,"Less than two weeks after recreational pot sales became legal in California, some of Sacramento’s dispensaries already are complaining about supply problems.

Curtis Ducart, purchasing manager for River City Phoenix and Hugs Sacramento, said the dispensaries haven’t been able to stock many of the edible marijuana products that are popular with people who consume cannabis but don’t like to smoke it. He said the dispensaries only have been able to secure products from three manufacturers instead of the 10 they used when they served only medical customers.

In going from a medical-marijuana market to a retail market, California’s cannabis industry has had to make some quick adjustments because state regulations weren’t released until about a month before the Jan. 1 start of retail sales. Few sectors of the industry were pinched as hard as the edibles market, as the state approved potency limits that were generally lower than what was sold to medical customers and required the edibles to be divided into portions.

“For people who don’t like to smoke, this is quite concerning,” Ducart said. “A lot of the edible companies are two to three months away from being able to sell.”

Kimberly Cargile, owner of A Therapeutic Alternative dispensary, said she has the same problem with edibles. “We had a huge selection before and now we have only a few kinds,” she said.

In a state with as much marijuana as California, it might be hard to imagine a supply shortage. But the supply chain is a new system, and it requires licensed operators to only work with other licensed operators. State and local regulators have acknowledged that it will take time before the state’s marijuana supply chain is operating efficiently, and interruptions should be expected.

“There is no supply shortage, but there is a permitting crisis, and it is especially severe in the Sacramento/Gold Country region,” said Hezekiah Allen of the California Growers Association.

Nevada, Colorado and Washington had supply shortages after the start of legalization.

Sacramento pot czar Joe Devlin said a lack of licensed distributors could create supply problems. Under state law, licensed distribution companies must ship cannabis products from cultivators, manufacturers and testing facilities to retail dispensaries.

The Bureau of Cannabis Control has licensed 66 distribution companies statewide and two in Sacramento. Devlin attributes the low number of distributors to the relatively short time that the state system has been in place, and he thinks companies will fill the void quickly.

“We won’t be talking about this in a couple of months,” he said.

Devlin’s counterpart at the state, Lori Ajax of the Bureau of Cannabis Control, also has expressed optimism that the distribution problem will work itself out.

Ducart said a lack of distributors has created some hangups for his dispensaries although not as much as the shortage of edibles.

Another supply issue for Sacramento dispensaries is all the nearby counties with bans on commercial grows, including Placer and Nevada, Allen said. Some dispensaries had agreements with growers in those counties before the bans were enacted."
40,40,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/california-weed/article210480879.html,Cannabis Cup: Sacramento hosts first marijuana festival in California,"A cloud of smoke hung over Cal Expo Friday afternoon as thousands gathered for the High Times Cannabis Cup, the first permitted event in California to allow recreational use of marijuana.

Organizers expected upwards of 15,000 people over the course of the two-day festival, which boasts musical performances from acclaimed artists, including Lauryn Hill, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Rich The Kid, Cypress Hill, Rick Ross and Ludacris.

The event was at risk of becoming a music-only festival until the Sacramento City Council approved a license for on-site consumption and sales in a 6-2 vote Tuesday. Weeks earlier, a similar High Times event had its permit denied by the San Bernardino City Council just before it was scheduled to take place.

At Cal Expo, crowds maneuvered their way through the rows of booths Friday afternoon, sometimes stopping to take long drags from blunts or sample products. In between puffs from a neatly-rolled joint, Brian Johnson said he was grateful to the city for approving the license.

“I think it was really cool for the city of Sacramento to trust the cannabis community to do something like this,"" Johnson said. ""I think we’ll hold up our end and have a great event with no mishaps. We’re just out here having fun, trying to socialize and enjoy our products.""

Other attendees, like medical marijuana user William Bennett, said they simply came to learn more about the cannabis industry.

Bennett said he wanted tips for growing marijuana at home. Bennett, who said he suffers from chronic pain caused by a back injury, began using medical marijuana about five years ago as an alternative to prescription opiate painkillers, which he said caused him unbearable side effects. Bennett has since started to grow his own.

“I’m kind of on the fence with recreational, but in the long run, it’s better than people drinking and doing other things,"" Bennett said. ""You don’t hear about people having big brawls and fights at (events like this). Everyone’s just sitting back.”





Bennett's wife, Dianne Kirk-Bennett, said she was impressed with how expansive and well-organized the event was.

“If this is your thing, this is the place to be,” Kirk-Bennett said.

The event has approximately 280 vendors, selling marijuana-themed apparel and art, vape pens, concentrates, topicals, edibles and a variety of other cannabis products.

High Times Chief Revenue Officer Matt Stang said it felt ""incredible"" to host the event, which he characterized as a watershed moment for the industry.

""It gives me a feeling that we’ve really progressed as a country. We’ve come to a point where we can have a peaceful gathering to consume and purchase cannabis with a state sanction,"" Stang said. ""The ability to do this legally — it’s been a long fight. High Times has been doing this for 44 years. We started as the voice of the opposition, and now we’ve grown into the majority. ""

Security was tight during for the strictly 21-and-up event. Unlike most music festivals, no alcohol sales were allowed.

Joe Devlin, Sacramento's chief of cannabis policy, said the event would generate more than $200,000 in tax revenue. Devlin said High Times “has a distinguished track record of hosting safe, successful and compliant cannabis events,” noting that the company had developed a “comprehensive security plan” that was approved by law enforcement and had organized a ride share program for those attending the festival.

Stang said High Times had contracted with two separate security firms to ensure no attendees purchased more than the legally-allowed amount and to check for impaired drivers. Ticket buyers were given Uber and Lyft codes at the time of purchase in order to minimize the risk of attendees driving under the influence.

For those in the industry, the event served as a safe demonstration to convince skeptics and state government officials.

“We want to make sure that people understand what a great, compliant, adult-use event can be, because we want this to be the model for the rest of the country,"" Stang said."
41,41,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/medical-marijuana-recommendation/,Increase Your Cannabis Savings with a Medical Marijuana Recommendation,"



The passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 made California the sixth state to allow the recreational use of cannabis. Yet nearly two-and-a-half years into cannabis legalization, many Californians are still choosing to see a cannabis doctor. But why?



California Municipalities Vs. Recreational Cannabis Sales

The truth is, there are 332 California municipalities that have full bans on cannabis activities. Here are the stats as of May 2018:



14% s allow recreational cannabis dispensaries.

19% sanction recreational marijuana deliveries inside their borders.

20% permit storefront medical cannabis dispensaries.

32% authorize MMJ delivery.

These numbers may change as legalization progresses but, as you can see, you’re clearly more likely to obtain legal cannabis with a medical marijuana recommendation.



Benefits of Being a Medical Cannabis Patient

You enjoy several perks that just don’t apply to recreational users.



Increased possession limits for all forms of cannabis.

Potential exemption from state and local sales taxes.

Less restrictive purchase limits at dispensaries and on cannabis delivery orders.

Increased access to cannabis (as mentioned).

Medical dispensaries offer first time patient (FTP) deals, which recreational users can’t receive.

In some municipalities, you can grow more plants.

Cannabis remains illegal for anyone under 21. If you are, you must get a MMJ card to legally partake.*

Simple and dedicated medical service; with NuggMD there is no cost to find out if you qualify.

(*Because of Measure BB, backed and passed by Weedmaps, Santa Ana medical cannabis patients under the age of 21 cannot purchase cannabis without their parents’ or guardians’ presence.)



Medical Marijuana I.D. Cards

MMICs, or medical marijuana identification cards, are different than medical marijuana recommendations. A MMIC registers you in a state-run database for easy verification without the need for personal info like address, Social Security or phone number. All that’s required is the card number.



MMICs are protected by HIPPA regulations so your info won’t appear in background checks or elsewhere. Additionally, a state MMJ ID card is the only way to obtain a state, and sometimes local, sales tax exemption.



Patients who can’t afford to pay the MMIC fee (now limited to $100 or less) can apply for a waiver. Those on Medi-Cal can receive their state-issued cards for $50 or less.







Medical Marijuana Recommendations

MMJ recs are by far the most common and preferred option of cannabis patient identification; most never obtain a MMIC and simply opt for a rec. All of the above MMIC benefits still apply, except for the sales tax. Recommendations are also not registered or stored in any state databases and covered under HIPPA.



A medical marijuana recommendation through NuggMD costs a mere $39, or $59 for it plus a wallet-sized cannabis photo ID card (a more convenient way to carry).



Applying for Your Medical Marijuana Recommendation Is Easy!

NuggMD has used their experience as the nation’s largest telemedicine service to provide the most simplified, affordable and streamlined service at the lowest possible price. They connect you to a registered cannabis doctor from any internet connected device with a camera, anywhere. Plus, you’ll only be charged if the doctor believes MMJ is right for you.



The average online process takes about 15-25 minutes, but take all the time you need with the doctor until you’re comfortable with medical cannabis. When approved, you instantly receive your recommendation via email, which you can immediately use to order from Nugg, until the hard copy comes in a few days.



Nugg Is Committed to You

NuggMD’s services don’t end after your recommendation. You also have access to a team of trained and incredibly knowledgeable cannabis concierges who will help you better understand how cannabis can meet your medical needs and improve your life.



Why such hands-on service? Because NuggMD’s founders believe you are the lynchpin of the cannabis community. “Anyone can provide ordinary services and try to cash in on the new green rush. Most of those companies won’t be here 10 years from now because they don’t recognize that the most important part of the cannabis industry isn’t the cannabis – it’s the cannabis consumer. After all, good cannabis isn’t hard to find anymore, but good customer service is.”

42,42,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/truth-lies-marijuana/,"Truth, lies and marijuana","I am worried because hate groups and fake news are on the rise, even here in San Francisco.

In a couple days, an anti-LGBT hate group will have the opportunity to address the Board of Supervisors and ask for their votes. They are appealing a decision by the Planning Commission — and they might even win, which is why I’m raising the alarm.

On Tuesday, the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) and its local allies will ask my former colleagues on the board to stop The Apothecarium from opening a medical cannabis dispensary in the Sunset District.

This should be simple. Sunset voters have overwhelmingly supported marijuana at the polls every time the issue has come before them. The Planning Commission voted 5-1 to approve the dispensary, and The Apothecarium is one of The City’s most respected dispensaries. But PJI and its network of right-wing, conservative Christian allies are pushing back.

This fight matters because the truth matters. PJI is a group that does not dwell in the realm of truth. Like our president, the group lies easily, reflexively and constantly. They have held news conferences claiming that people have died of marijuana overdoses. They have predicted gunfire in the Sunset if the dispensary opens.

These are fear-mongering lies. It’s important that we call them out clearly and simply for what they are: lies. In all of recorded history, no one has ever died of a marijuana overdose. And gunfire? That’s laughable. For 25 years, San Francisco has had medical cannabis dispensaries, peacefully. I can’t remember the last time I heard of a serious issue arising because of a dispensary.

PJI isn’t an ordinary hate group. They combine a veneer of legal respectability with outreach to communities of color — especially my own community, Chinese Americans. This is a new force in San Francisco politics: right-wing Christian groups successfully organizing in the Chinese community.

So far, they’ve been effective. A couple months ago, PJI and its partners turned out 700 people — the vast majority of them Chinese American — to testify against the dispensary. Virtually every word spoken against the project was based on PJI’s lies and propaganda.

Some claimed that traffic deaths would rise. (That’s a lie; states with legal marijuana see traffic deaths go down by around 10 percent.) Others claimed that teen use of marijuana would skyrocket. (That’s also a lie; teen use of marijuana has stayed flat or gone down both nationally and in Colorado.) Still, others said a dispensary would bring crime to the Sunset neighborhood. (This is another easily disproved lie; peer-reviewed data shows that dispensaries deter crime.)

If all these arguments have a familiar ring to them, that’s no surprise. For decades, PJI has used a version of these false arguments against the LGBT community. That’s why they have been designated an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

PJI has pushed the lie that homosexuality is caused by child abuse. They have promoted the harmful and discredited practice of reparative therapy, which seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation. Now, they are directing their “What about the children?!” hysteria toward cannabis patients.

It is tempting to dismiss PJI as clowns. But they successfully overturned an earlier attempt to open a medical cannabis dispensary in the Sunset and have clearly made inroads with conservative Christian Chinese organizers in the Bay Area.

While many San Franciscans are rightly focused on fighting hate groups at the national level, we must not allow PJI and its allies to gain a further foothold in our city or our political discourse.

If a right-wing group can convince the Board of Supervisors to vote with them — undoing the clearly expressed will of the voters — then we are in very deep trouble.

43,43,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/legal-cannabis-sales-begin-monday-california-not-sf/,"Legal cannabis sales begin Monday in California, but not in SF","The historic moment of legal marijuana sales begins Monday in cities throughout California, but those in San Francisco will have to wait until at least next weekend to buy recreational weed.

A number of San Francisco’s existing medical dispensaries are working through both City Hall’s Office of Cannabis and the state’s Bureau of Cannabis Control to obtain approval to begin selling the drug to adults over 21.

Businesses need to obtain both a state license and local approval before that happens. None have yet.

Because the Board of Supervisors did not approve legislation regulating recreational cannabis sales until Dec. 5, the law won’t take effect locally until Jan. 6 — the earliest sales can begin.

The board had stumbled in meeting the Jan. 1 milestone amid significant political pressure from a segment of the Chinese community, who took an anti-cannabis stance and showed up en mass at City Hall to urge strict regulations — and even for The City to ban weed altogether. Ultimately, the board crafted rules to the satisfaction of the cannabis industry, such as by reducing the distance cannabis outlets must be from schools from 1,000 feet to 600 feet.

It was unclear Friday if retail sales will begin Jan. 6. Nicole Elliott, the Office of Cannabis director, said it’s possible — but not certain.

“The City is working hard to prepare operators for temporary adult use sales as early as Jan. 6 and we are reviewing operators’ security plans, good neighbor policies and equity plans at this time,” Elliott told the San Francisco Examiner.

She said not until she gives the approval can state licenses be officially granted to local shops, but dispensaries can go through the two approval processes concurrently.

Many already are.

The rollout has had at least one mixup. The state granted the first adult use cannabis sales permit in San Francisco to Flower Power Dispensary at 70th Second St., which was confirmed by Alex Traverso, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Cannabis Control.

That news, however, came as a surprise to Elliott, who said she hadn’t authorized any dispensaries to receive state licenses to sell retail cannabis and that “it will be undone.”

Sure enough, later that day, what was the first adult use retail cannabis license granted in San Francisco was revoked. “The adult use license was issued in error,” Traverso said in an email after being asked to respond to Elliott’s comment. “We’ve revoked the adult use license for now, pending city approval.”

Flower Power did not respond to requests for comment.

Elliott provided the Examiner with a list of 20 medical dispensaries that are furthest along in the local approval process to begin selling retail cannabis.

They include the three locations of The Apothecarium.

“We are hoping to start recreational sales at The Apothecarium’s Castro, SoMa and Marina stores on January 6,” Eliot Dobris, The Apothecarium’s spokesperson, said Friday. “We are hopeful that at least one of them will be permitted for recreational sales on January 6. However, like other San Francisco dispensaries, we are still waiting to receive our city permits.”

He added The Apothecarium has planned a promotion on Jan. 6 to celebrate the historic moment. There will be a 20 percent discount off one’s purchase if they bring their mother. “We want people to know that The Apothecarium is a safe and friendly place where you can feel comfortable bringing your mother,” Dobris said.

The City is most immediately focused on existing dispensaries starting to sell recreational cannabis. But The City will also soon start allowing new outlets to open, but only through an equity program meant to provide redress for the impacts of the war on drugs. To be considered for the equity program, applicants must meet certain criteria, such as having been arrested for cannabis crimes.

Applications for these new business are not yet available. “We are seeking to make applications available in the first quarter of 2018,” Elliott said.

Former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, California’s current lieutenant governor running for governor, said in a Dec. 21 tweet that, “Legalizing marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform.”

He wrote, “It’s about ending the failed war on drugs and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities.”

The new era of legal cannabis officially begins Monday, after voters approved Proposition 64 last year. Statewide, the cannabis industry is expected to have more than $7 billion in sales annually and generate an estimated $1 billion in tax revenues. The industry is also expected to serve as a growing job sector.

The City is exploring creating a job-training program similar to the one it has for construction work to help residents gain employment in the cannabis industry, such as in retail, back office and manufacturing.

“We will leverage our robust training programs we offer today in hospitality, healthcare, and construction to train and connect residents to new jobs in the cannabis industry,” said Katherine Daniel, a deputy director with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. “Like any emerging sector we will look for opportunities to create new or additional training to better prepare residents for these jobs.”

As of Friday morning, the Bureau of Cannabis Control said it had issued 174 permits for cannabis operations throughout the state, including for medical, adult use retail, distribution and micro-businesses. There were 691 pending applications.

44,44,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/california-laws-owning-operating-cannabis-business/,California laws for owning and operating a cannabis business,"This week’s question comes from Robin D. in San Francisco, who asks:

Q: “I understand that marijuana (cannabis) will be come legal in 2018. Some friends and I are thinking of starting a retail cannabis store. We currently own a liquor store and want to know about the new laws, so we don’t get busted for illegal distribution.”

A: Robin, I am not a cannabis attorney, and we do not represent people who sell or buy marijuana in either criminal or civil proceedings (except for suing distributors for mislabeling, defective products and those who cause injury under the influence). Here is a very general analysis of the new laws relating to the ownership and operation of cannabis businesses, but if you wish to pursue this line of business, contact a lawyer with specific knowledge in this area for guidance.

Cannabis is about to be legal (and heavily regulated). To deal with the myriad issues related to legalized marijuana, California has charged some existing regulatory bodies -— the Department of Food and Agriculture (for cultivators), the Department of Public Health (for manufacturers) and the Department of Consumer Affair’s Bureau of Cannabis Control (for retailers, distributors and testers) — with developing regulations to implement the new cannabis laws. The Departments of Agriculture and Public Health have long been established; the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) is a new division within the Department of Consumer Affairs.

The new regulations set forth by the BCC are designed to regulate cannabis business operations. Some of the regulations are designed to identify and restrict any criminal enterprises from engaging in cannabis sales. For example, Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations (when laws are passed, the agencies are tasked with drafting regulations for their implementation, which are published in the CCR) Section 5002 requires those who want to sell cannabis to obtain a license and renew it annually and, in doing so, to identify not only who will own and operate the business but also who the investors are and where the funds for the operation come from, as well as where the funds for the enterprise are kept, such as bank accounts.

An applicant for a license must disclose whether they have an interest in any other cannabis operations, as well as any prior criminal convictions, a detailed description of the offenses leading to convictions, dates of incarceration, probation, parole and other criminal history. According to the regulations, a prior conviction, in which the sentence, including any term of probation, incarceration or supervised release, is completed for possession of, possession for sale, sale, manufacture, transportation or cultivation of a controlled substance shall not be the sole ground for denial of a license. Conviction for any controlled substance felony after licensure shall be grounds for revocation of a license or denial of the renewal of a license.

When considering prior criminal offense, the BCC will consider the nature of the offense, including the severity of the offense, whether the offense would be a felony under current law at the time of the application (many drug crimes that were felonies at the time of their occurrence have now been decriminalized), the applicant’s criminal record, the time since the offense occurred and any evidence of rehabilitation in determining whether a permit should be issued.

The regulations state that a criminal conviction of any person holding a license to sell marijuana, which occurs after the license has been issued, must notify the BCC within 48 hours of such a conviction and the conviction may be the basis of revocation of the license or refusal to reissue the license.

Regulations prohibit any individual holding office in any state agency that regulates marijuana, as well as any persons employed by the state’s Department of Justice or any district attorney’s office, city attorney’s office, sheriff’s office or local police department, from holding a license to sell marijuana.

If you or any of your partners work in such a capacity, you cannot be owners of the business.

You should also be aware that a landlord may refuse to rent to you, and an applicant must demonstrate that a landlord has provided written approval for their premises to be used as a marijuana business.

If you decide to go forward with your plan, you will need to provide evidence of $2 million in liability insurance and post a $5,000 bond to ensure payment of the cost incurred for the destruction of cannabis goods necessitated by any violation of the regulations.

Be aware that cannabis, like alcohol, may be sold only to people ages 21 or over. However, unlike alcohol, cannabis may be sold to an individual 18 or older who has a valid physician recommendation.

Lastly, while a retailer may sell noncannabis products in their shop, cannabis can not be sold where alcohol, alcohol products, tobacco and tobacco products are sold.

45,45,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-will-continue-roll-legal-cannabis-despite-threat-justice-department/,SF will continue to roll out legal cannabis despite threat from Justice Department,"San Francisco will continue with plans to permit pot shops to sell recreational cannabis as early as Saturday despite Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinding Thursday the Obama-era policy of lenient enforcement of the federal law prohibiting marijuana.

Sessions’ decision to rescind President Barack Obama’s policy is a significant step backward for marijuana advocates who have fought for decades to legalize the drug. The decision creates uncertainty around whether the federal government will start cracking down on the recreational cannabis industry in California, which became legal Monday as a result of voter-approved Proposition 64.

SEE RELATED: Legal cannabis sales begin Monday in California, but not in SF

Both San Francisco’s Office of Cannabis and California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control said Thursday they will continue with existing plans to permit new recreational marijuana businesses.

Businesses need approval from both agencies to begin selling retail cannabis in San Francisco. The earliest legal cannabis sales can be permitted under local law is Saturday. None had yet to gain approval to do so as of Thursday afternoon.

“We will respect the will of the voters and continue to move forward in implementing state law,” Acting Mayor London Breed, who is also serving as president of the Board of Supervisors, said Thursday.

She continued, “Here in San Francisco, we have worked hard during the last year to put a regulatory structure in place that will reinvest in communities that have historically been affected by the war on drugs and ensure that adult use sales are safe and responsible.”

Lori Ajax, chief of California’s Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, said Thursday they are conferring with the California attorney general and other states on the matter, but will proceed.

“We expect the federal government to respect the rights of states and the votes of millions of people across America and if they won’t, Congress should act,” Ajax said in a statement Thursday. “Regardless, we’ll continue to move forward with the state’s regulatory processes covering both medicinal and adult-use cannabis consistent with the will of California’s voters, while defending our state’s laws to the fullest extent.”

For San Francisco, a long-time leader on medical marijuana, the conflict and confusion over federal drug enforcement is nothing new. In 2012, for instance, the U.S. Justice Department sent threatening letters to landlords of pot clubs in San Francisco, which prompted the closure of prominent cannabis operators.

Sessions’ new marijuana enforcement policy issued in a memo Thursday comes as legal cannabis has gained growing acceptance and recreational use is now legal in eight states as well as Washington, D.C.

Sessions said in a statement Thursday that the Obama-era marijuana enforcement policy “undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission.”

He continued, “Therefore, today’s memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.”

Obama’s administration had faced sharp criticism from cannabis advocates for federal government enforcement against marijuana, such as by sending threatening letters to landlords of pot shops and raiding establishments, leading to such headlines as “Obama’s War on Pot.” But subsequent Obama policy helped usher in legalization, notably the guidance from his Deputy Attorney General James Cole in August 2013, which essentially promised no federal prosecution for medical and recreational cannabis activities as long as it was regulated by states and local governments.

Sessions, a President Donald Trump appointment, rescinded the August 2013 Cole memo Thursday, along with other policies, and instead said enforcement of marijuana laws is up to the discretion of U.S. attorneys in the districts they represent.

Sessions’ memo notes that “marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime” and says in deciding to pursue prosecution of marijuana activity, federal prosecutors should weigh the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect it would have.

It’s not immediately clear what impacts this may have on California’s new legal recreational cannabis industry, which is estimated to generate $7 billion annually in sales and $1 billion in tax revenue.

Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor and candidate for California governor, blasted Sessions’ decision. Newsom, himself a proponent of cannabis legalization, said it “flies in the face of the overwhelming public opinion of a vast majority of Americans, who support marijuana legalization.”

Newsom said in the statement, “Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration destructively doubled down on the failed, costly and racially discriminatory policy of marijuana criminalization.”

While recreational sales began Monday in some cities where pot shops obtained state and local permits, those in San Francisco cannot begin selling recreational cannabis until Saturday at the earliest under legislation approved last month by the Board of Supervisors and mayor regulating the recreational cannabis industry.

Only existing medical dispensaries in San Francisco can begin selling retail cannabis this weekend, and only after obtaining a state license from California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control, which cannot be issued without authorization from The City’s Office of Cannabis.

The Office of Cannabis was reviewing about 20 applications from dispensaries that sought to start selling retail cannabis, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported. These businesses are required to submit such required documents as a “good neighbor” policy, a security plan and a plan to foster more equity, such as through hiring employees who were arrested in the past for cannabis crimes.

Applicants remain hopeful they will receive approval to begin selling recreational cannabis on Saturday.

Existing medical marijuana dispensaries are also required to obtain a permit to continue to sell medical cannabis. Twenty dispensaries and three delivery services in San Francisco obtained such permits, according to the Bureau of Cannabis Control’s database.

“The city and county of San Francisco continues to work towards bringing all operators in compliance with state and local law,” Nicole Elliott, director of the Office of Cannabis, said in a statement. “In 2016, the majority of voters demanded this activity be legalized to allow for the thoughtful regulation of activity that has been occurring for decades. This regulation will serve to create a safer environment for our communities and consumers.”

The Board of Supervisors Land Use and Transportation Committee unanimously approved the ban Monday and forwarded it to the full board for a vote.

The ban, introduced by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, comes after the board last year approved citywide regulations that ushered in the new era of legal recreational cannabis, following voter approval of Proposition 64. The regulations were hotly contested by some in the Chinese-American community who opposed the entire industry and viewed cannabis as a harmful drug.

Peskin, who represents Chinatown, said he was respecting the wishes of Chinatown residents. Distancing himself from reefer madness, Peskin said the ban proposal centers “around concerns about gentrification and rents that Chinatown has been fighting.”

Mayor London Breed also expressed support for the ban during her campaign, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported.

The committee’s support comes despite the Planning Commission voting 5 to 2 on June 14 to reject the proposal. Commissioners objected to taking a piecemeal approach to cannabis regulations and emphasized the importance of having an equitable approach for all neighborhoods.

Peskin noted the commission is advisory, and pointed to a letter sent in April by Wing Hoo Leung, president of the Community Tenants Association, in support of the pot ban.

“At least until this newly-legal industry stabilizes, the prospect of high rents that cannabis retail can afford is causing property owners to hold out on renting vacant commercial space and, in some instances, to raise the rents of existing community-serving retail space – sometimes doubling them – in order to replace them with higher rent businesses. Our fragile commercial corridors in Chinatown will not survive this pressure,” he wrote.

The letter also complained that “Chinatown [single-room occupancy] buildings are old, the walls are often thin, and secondhand smoke continues to be a problem for many of our tenants.”

Supervisor Ahsha Safai had previously tried to impose a ban on additional pot businesses in the Excelsior neighborhood he represents but the board shot it down when enacting the new cannabis regulations.

“I really appreciate the theme of respecting the district supervisor’s wishes when it comes to issues like this. So hopefully we will have further conversation in the months to come,” Safai said.

He later confirmed to the Examiner he may try again to get a cap approved for the Excelsior.

Gascon announced on Wednesday that his office will immediately dismiss and seal 3,038 misdemeanor convictions and review another 4,940 more serious felony convictions that could be reduced and resentenced.

“We want to address the wrongs that were caused by the failures of the War on Drugs for many years in this country and begin to fix the harm that was done not only to the entire nation but specifically to communities of color,” Gascon said.

SEE RELATED: Dispensary alleges supervisors were under political influence in Sunset pot shop decision

Under Prop. 64, California voters legalized recreational cannabis for adults over the age of 21 beginning in January. Prop. 64 also allowed those convicted of marijuana offenses to petition their cases for dismissal or reduction to a lesser offense.

But Gascon said only 23 people in San Francisco and 4,885 people in California have used Prop. 64 to petition their cases so far. Gascon’s plan is to begin the process automatically in San Francisco without those who are eligible having to hire an attorney or come to court.

“We will do all the work for them,” Gascon said.

The criminal justice system has disproportionately targeted people of color in San Francisco and across the nation, with drug offenses creating barriers to employment and housing for minorities. Gascon said that as many as 2.8 million Californians were arrested on cannabis offenses between 1915 and 2016.

“This is a giant step toward justice and it is a stride toward getting black people free to live in the community, to have jobs, to have health care, to have decent education,” said Rev. Amos Brown, leader of the local chapter of the NAACP.

Supervisor Malia Cohen, who represents the Bayview, said the effort goes hand-in-hand with the equity program she spearheaded to benefit cannabis dispensary applicants previously convicted of drug-related crimes.

“It’s the marrying of our political ideology, finally, in lockstep with our policy,” Cohen said.

Gascon announced the plan at a Hall of Justice news conference Wednesday alongside Brown, Cohen, Office of Cannabis Director Nicole Elliott, Supervisor Jeff Sheehy and Laura Thomas of the Drug Policy Alliance.

Gascon said those with cannabis misdemeanor offenses should check to see if their records have been cleared in the coming months.

The felony cases require a second layer of review and take longer to be resentenced.

Medithrive, Grass Roots and Harvest on Geary became the first three medical marijuana dispensaries to obtain approval from the Office of Cannabis and then late Friday from the state Bureau of Cannabis Control to sell recreational cannabis.

SEE RELATED: SF gives green light to seven dispensaries to seek state approval for recreational weed sales

Both Grass Roots, at 1077 Post St., and Harvest on Geary, at 4811 Geary Blvd., confirmed to the San Francisco Examiner they would begin selling recreational cannabis Saturday morning. Medithrive did not confirm sales.

Grass Roots said they would begin sales at 8 a.m. Harvest on Geary is expected to begin sales at 9 a.m.

“We’re grateful to be participating in this momentous day,” said Harvest on Geary owner Marty Higgins.

Higgins said they have been preparing for months with inventory and staffing.

Recreational cannabis became legal on Monday throughout California after voters approved Proposition 64 last year. While recreational sales began in other cities on New Year’s Day, San Francisco law regulating recreational cannabis allowed sales to begin on Saturday, at the earliest.

After the initial first three adult sales permits were granted, more dispensaries received state licenses to sell retail cannabis, including ReLeaf Herbal Cooperative, at 1284 Mission St., and The Green Cross, at 4218 Mission Street, according to the Bureau of Cannabis database.

The Apothecarium, at 2029 Market St., said they also obtained a state license to sell retail sales and plan to have a ribbon cutting ceremony with State Sen. Scott Wiener and Supervisor Jeff Sheehy beginning at 8:15 am, with doors opening for sales at 9 am.

The seven dispensaries in San Francisco that may seek a state license to begin selling marijuana are:

– Grass Roots, at 1077 Post St.

– Harvest on Geary, at 4811 Geary Blvd.

– MediThrive, at 1933 Mission St.

– Shambhala, at 2441 Mission St.

– ReLeaf Herbal Cooperative, at 1284 Mission St.

– The Apothecarium, at 2029 Market St.

– The Green Cross, at 4218 Mission St.

Alex Traverso, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, said the state hoped to issue licenses to the seven dispensaries Friday.

“We just received The City’s approved list a few hours ago,” Traverso told the San Francisco Examiner. “[We’re] working to get those seven licensed by [close of business] today, if possible.”

The City has received 31 submissions to date from dispensaries seeking authorization to sell adult-use recreational marijuana. City officials said those submissions are being reviewed in the order in which they were received by the Department of Public Health, the Police Department and the Office of Cannabis.

California ushered in a new era with legalized cannabis on New Year’s Day, with numerous Bay Area locations celebrating the occasion. However, those in San Francisco cannot begin selling recreational cannabis until Saturday at the earliest under legislation approved last month by the Board of Supervisors and mayor regulating the recreational cannabis industry, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported.

“As San Francisco implements legal adult-use cannabis, we look forward to the benefits to consumers, who will be able to know that they are buying products that are regulated and tested for quality and safety,” Health Department Director Barbara Garcia said in a statement. “We anticipate working together with retailers to ensure that consumers are given information about the safe consumption of the products, so that the transition goes smoothly and successfully for everyone.”

Office of Cannabis Director Nicole Elliott acknowledged the significance of The City’s decision to proceed with authorizing recreational marijuana sales.

“The City has been working diligently and swiftly to move the cannabis industry to a regulated space so that our small businesses can be in compliance with state and local law – laws that are meant to better protect our communities and consumers,” she said in a statement. “Today marks an important transition in our endeavors, and I appreciate these retailers’ commitment to being good neighbors and to creating a safer and more equitable environment in San Francisco.”

The announcement comes a day after Attorney General Jeff Sessions shared his decision Thursday to rescind the Obama-era policy of lenient enforcement of the federal law prohibiting marijuana, marking a significant step backward for marijuana advocates who have fought for decades to legalize the drug. The decision creates uncertainty around whether the federal government will start cracking down on the recreational cannabis industry in California, which became legal Monday as a result of voter-approved Proposition 64.

50,50,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/sfs-marijuana-labor-movement-growing-new-dispensary-applicant/,SF’s marijuana labor movement growing with new dispensary applicant,"The site of San Francisco’s last gun shop that shuttered two years ago may turn into a medical marijuana dispensary.

The Bernal Heights Cooperative’s permit application to open for business as a medical marijuana dispensary is set to go before the Planning Commission today.

The proposed dispensary would occupy the commercial space formerly famous for being San Francisco’s last remaining gun shop, known as High Bridge Arms, at 3185 Mission St. The gun store closed when the Board of Supervisors added more restrictions on gun shops.

The dispensary was displaced after the building where it operated out of since 2005 was sold, and a new dispensary that could pay more rent displaced it, according to dispensary applicant Sean Killen.

The tech software worker decided to enter the marijuana industry in 2015 by helping the cooperative. Killen said The City shouldn’t allow the permit to be transferred from one dispensary to another at the same location to prevent similar building sales, displacing long-term dispensaries.

“It’s been a work in progress ever since 2015 to just put it in a new home,” Killen said. That included paying $5,000 in rent for the former gun shop site since last year and also maintaining a site outside The City and offering a delivery service to longstanding patients.

The application is also among the first batch of dispensary applications to heard by the Planning Commission since voters approved Proposition 64 in November, which legalized adult recreational use of marijuana.

The application has another distinction. Killen on Tuesday signed an agreement, which was provided to the San Francisco Examiner, with United Food & Commercial Workers, Local 648, a local chapter of labor union United Food and Commercial Workers that represents a growing number workers in the marijuana industry across California.

The union is in talks with City College of San Francisco to create an apprenticeship training program for the medical marijuana industry beginning in the spring 2018 semester.

Killen’s agreement supports employees organizing and agrees to certain worker standards, such as at least $20 an hour in the first year of employment. Killen said it is the first such agreement with UFCW Local 648 and a dispensary. He also committed to hiring local apprentices through UFCW.

“If we knew someone was coming in with the right knowledge I think that’s fantastic,” Killen said in support the proposed CCSF cannabis training program

UFCW Local 648 did not return calls for comment, but member Jennifer Garcia said in an email that the union “is excited to work with Bernal Heights Cooperative and we hope that the Planning Commission approves their application to re-open.”

The state is expected to begin in January 2018 issuing permits for recreational marijuana use in accordance with Prop. 64.

Mayor Ed Lee has directed departments to come up with local permits by September 2017. San Francisco is expected to permit adult-use businesses and allow medical dispensaries to apply to also distribute recreational marijuana.

The location is in the proximity of its former location at 33 29th St., where Harvest now operates out of and Cookie Co. 415 at 3139 Mission St. There is another dispensary application pending at 3326 Mission St.

There is some opposition to the proposal. One resident wrote the commission opposing the application arguing that two other locations in the area was sufficient for patient access.

Killen said he understands concerns of clustering, but also thought two or three wasn’t a problem.

“The claim we are trying to make is that we are continuing our service,” Killen said. “It’s in the neighborhood still. We are just down the street from where we [were]. We are serving the same patient base.”

What’s more, there are now 30 states where medical marijuana is allowed, with a couple more close to coming on board.

So, as vacationers prepare to hit the road, many have a simple question: How can we legally mix travel and weed?

In California, the rules on traveling with cannabis are evolving. And conflicts between state and federal marijuana laws – and how rules are enforced among the various states or even one airport vs. another – are causing confusion.

For recreational consumers of cannabis, the simple answer is to leave weed at home and, if desired, to unwind with a cocktail. But for medical patients who aren’t able to take along specific strains or cannabis products they use daily to combat symptoms of an illness or chronic pain, summer travel could be anything but simple.

Here’s a closer look at what the law says, how the rules are actually playing out and what experts recommend to stay safe and legal.

Promoters say they planned to stop operating under the loose protections of the state’s medical marijuana laws, where they’d force attendees to get doctor’s recommendations for cannabis before entering the gates. Instead, they hoped to have licenses that would allow anyone 21 and older to buy and smoke cannabis, just like they can buy and drink beer at other festivals.

But with local authorities now able to block such festivals even from the limited venues where they’re permitted by new state rules, there weren’t any state-sanctioned events in Southern California during the first half of the year. And none are on the horizon for the rest of 2018.

Interested in more coverage of the California marijuana industry? Head to TheCannifornian.com or subscribe to The Cannifornian newsletter to get cannabis-related news, features and more.

The picture is a bit brighter in Northern California. The state licensed marijuana festivals this spring in Sacramento and in Santa Rosa, where the massive Emerald Cup is also expected to go off in December without a hitch.

“It’s costing us a lot of money, but it’s going to come back in the long run,” said Tim Blake, who founded The Emerald Cup festival and competition 15 years ago. “We’re going to really be teaching them how it should be done.”

But with many of California’s largest marijuana festivals – such as the upcoming Chalice California in Victorville – unable to secure permits to allow consumption and sales, overall attendance and revenue for promoters, vendors and fairground venues is expected to be down significantly in the first year of legalization.

“We are taking a big hit,” said Franco Rodriguez, promoter of the High Life Music Festival, which got turned down for a marijuana sales permit by the city of San Bernardino. “Our own government is not letting the people do what we voted for.”

People who own hotels, restaurants and other businesses near these venues are also expressing concern. They say the boost they’ve seen as tens of thousands of people have flocked to these events in the past has helped them sustain and grow their operations.

A lawsuit over these festival rules is pending, while some organizers say they’re looking to move their events out of California.

Other festival promoters are taking the same approach as the rest of California’s still-massive black market. They’re citing a “crippling” permit system, lingering legal gray areas and delayed enforcement as justification to keep hosting events that make it look as though nothing has changed when it comes to marijuana laws in California – even though, officially, everything has.

Options limited

Festivals that let people buy and smoke marijuana are now legally restricted to fairground venues authorized by the Department of Food and Agriculture.

“There’s no other type of event to be limited to that,” Blake said. “It’s kind of ridiculous.”

Several of the state’s 80 sanctioned fairs are defunct or share facilities. Others – such as Santa Maria Fairpark, home to the Santa Barbara County Fair – can’t host cannabis events under state law because they’re within 600 feet of schools.

Carving out those properties leaves California with around 70 venues that can entertain the notion of permitting cannabis festivals. But the obstacles don’t end there.

Layers of permission required

For 20 years, medical marijuana festivals in California only needed permission from whoever owned or managed the event venue. But as of Jan. 1, companies that want to host festivals where cannabis can be sold and consumed must first get annual licenses from the state. Then, for every event they host, they need permission from the board that oversees the venue, from the city or county where the venue is located and again from the state.

Several fair boards, such as the ones that oversee OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa and Amador County Fairgrounds & Event Center near Sacramento, have opted to ban all cannabis-themed events.

“We just don’t think it is a good fit for us here in Amador County,” said Troy Bowers, chief executive for the Northern California venue.

The Department of Food Agriculture has recommended “that each fair board set local policy about cannabis events,” according to agency spokesman Steve Lyle. But managers for some facilities, including Tehama District Fairgrounds in Northern California, said they don’t have a policy because they haven’t yet been approached about holding marijuana events. Others say their city or county already prohibits all commercial cannabis activity, so they know festivals wouldn’t get local approval anyway.

“We have to abide by local rules and regulations,” said Dan Jacobs, general manager of the Antelope Valley Fair & Event Center in Lancaster, which blocks marijuana sales.

Only around 10 state-sanctioned fairground venues are in cities or counties that permit recreational marijuana sales, according to a database of local marijuana policies compiled by the Southern California News Group.

In at least two of those 10 communities, either the fair board or local authorities have already opted to block cannabis events. That leaves perhaps eight viable venues for hosting marijuana festivals in all of California, with several in remote communities far from the state’s population centers.

Organizers feel ‘big hit’

Getting turned down for marijuana consumption and sales permits is expected to mean a substantial drop in attendance, industry insiders say.

Attendees called High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup, held in San Bernardino in April, a “ghost town” after the city refused to sign off on the event at the last minute.

Chalice is still slated to take place in Victorville from July 13-15, with shows by Ludacris and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on the ticket. But promoter Ryan Heil said he expects a 60 percent loss in revenue after the city said its ordinance bans cannabis sales at the event, which they said brought more than $33 million to the area last year.

Rodriguez said he expects to make at least 50 percent less money than he’d hoped when High Life comes to National Orange Show Events Center in September, since he was forced to make it an all-ages show with no cannabis sales allowed. They’re still telling adults 21 and older that they can bring their own marijuana to consume in a “cannabis garden.”"

California legalized marijuana in 2016, and this past New Year’s Eve eager customers lined up in the darkness outside medical marijuana dispensaries across the state, ready to start shopping at the stroke of midnight.

The effect has gone beyond the cannabis cash register. Everyone has seen the ads or heard the chatter — and that includes minors, though marijuana remains illegal for those under 21.

“Coming out of SFO [San Francisco] airport, there are billboards for Eaze [a weed delivery service] that say ‘Marijuana is here,’” said Danielle Ramo, a psychologist who conducts research at University of California-San Francisco on adolescent drug use. “I’m not sure parents were expecting to see so many images of cannabis all over.”

Failures have been triggered by inaccurate labeling or contamination from pesticides, bacteria or processing chemicals.

Those testing requirements and results have left some retailers with severely limited inventory over the past few weeks, as cultivators and product manufacturers scramble to get compliant products to market.

There was a big gap at the beginning of the month with the supply of marijuana buds in particular, according to Nick Rinella, chief operating officer of Verdant Distribution, a Long Beach-based independent cannabis distributor.

The new testing requirements have also created backlogs at busy labs.

The state has licensed just 31 testing labs, most located in Northern California, and many of them aren’t yet taking customers. As a result, Rinella said cannabis safety tests are taking between one and two weeks.

And this week the first cannabis product was recalled from store shelves because it doesn’t meet new standards regarding pesticide levels.

While that’s concerning, in the short term, industry experts believe it’s also a sign that California’s cannabis industry is maturing and starting to look like other regulated markets, such as alcohol and food.

All three shifts are among the new rules proposed Friday by state regulators in their long-awaited draft of permanent regulations for California’s cannabis industry.

The permanent regulations will replace the “emergency” rules under which the multibillion-dollar industry has been operating this year. The public has 45 days to comment — in writing or at one of 10 hearings to be held soon throughout the state — on the proposed permanent cannabis rules before they’re adopted by regulators.

This is the state’s fourth round of developing regulations for the cannabis industry.

Rules first were drafted for the medical marijuana sector, but those had to be scrapped after Californians voted to approve recreational marijuana in November 2016. The state released its first round of emergency regulations for both sectors in November 2017, then made some changes as they extended those emergency rules this May. But the goal is to get final rules in place by the end of the year.

“This is about seven months of listening, going to meetings and events and all of these town halls and summits, and hearing what people had to say about how the emergency regulations were working or not working,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which oversees marijuana retailers, distributors, event promoters and lab testers.

Many of the changes simply clarify the laws that regulators already laid out, Traverso explained. He said that’s true, for example, of what seems to be a big change to cannabis delivery rules.

Emergency regulations said cities couldn’t stop marijuana delivery services from using public roads. But that was interpreted by some city attorneys to mean that even though municipalities couldn’t prevent licensed deliveries from passing through their jurisdictions, they could ban them from actually making stops in their towns. The recommended permanent regulation — included in 136 pages of rules issued Friday by the bureau — clarifies the law this way: “A delivery employee may deliver to any jurisdiction within the State of California.”

Interested in more coverage of the California marijuana industry? Head to TheCannifornian.com or subscribe to The Cannifornian newsletter to get cannabis-related news, features and more.

Given that most California cities still don’t allow retail cannabis sales, any expansion of delivery services figures to make cannabis more accessible to more people, said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association.

The bureau’s updated rules also include tougher guidelines for cannabis advertisers and packaging. Retailers will no longer be able to promote free products, for example. And there are stricter rules about marketing products in ways that might appeal to kids.

In its separate list — 111 pages of draft permanent rules — for companies that make marijuana products, the Department of Public Health’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch is proposing to loosen one rule that figures to benefit medical marijuana patients.

Emergency rules say edible products must be in packages with no more than 100 total milligrams of THC, the chemical in cannabis that can make people high. The rules out Friday suggest letting patients with doctor’s recommendations for medical marijuana buy dissolving “edibles,” such as lozenges or mouth strips, that have up to 500 milligrams of THC.

The Department of Food and Agriculture’s CalCannabis division, which oversees cultivators, also issued 68 pages of new rules that don’t include a change favored by growers.

The department didn’t add back in a 1-acre cap on grow space per farmer. That cap was floated in state environmental documents, but dropped in emergency regulations. The California Growers Association in January sued the state over that change, saying it was needed to give small- and medium-sized growers a chance to compete in the new market.

Many licensed retailers say they’re struggling to stay afloat. So Traverso said most of the other changes included in the rules released Friday are technical tweaks aimed at making compliance easier, including loosening a number of rules for distributors and easing a couple lab testing and labeling requirements.

Though around two-thirds of the city’s residents supported legalizing marijuana when it hit the ballot last year, several members of the council have resisted allowing businesses to operate within the city. A local church group has been particularly vocal in its opposition and even local law enforcement officials have cited concerns about crime with little recent data, Thorpe said.

“Your local Applebee’s creates more crime than cannabis,” Thorpe said, noting that the restaurant serves alcohol.

Wilson acknowledged she originally opposed allowing marijuana to be sold in the city, but said she felt differently after learning more about the industry.

“I really had to open my mind,” Wilson said.

Sean Kali-rai, the founder and president of the Silicon Valley Cannabis Alliance hopes more local officials will make that same leap. And if they’re not, he’s preparing to push them toward acceptance.

“We’re really going to start to try to push the industry,” he said.

The former San Jose official said he’s meeting with former Obama organizer Peggy Moore and working on a political action committee.

“We will help them figure out how to vote,” Kali-rai said, issuing what seemed to be a barely veiled threat to city officials to get on board or prepare to face a backlash.

For now, though, despite what residents may want, many cities don’t have licensing systems in place to allow marijuana companies to operate legally. So many people are either driving long distances to buy cannabis or opting to purchase it illegally nearby. It also leaves marijuana companies scrambling to figure out the tangled web of different regulations and ordinances, with few options for where to operate.

David Hua is the CEO of Meadow, a Y Combinator-backed software startup that aims to connect medical cannabis patients with dispensaries. But, he said, “It’s been a challenge to be a tech provider in this space.”

Businesses find themselves playing “arbitrage,” Hua continued, urging for increased simplicity across the state.

But reaching that point means that places like Antioch, which is still in the beginning stages of figuring out whether and how to allow legal sales, have to play catch up with places like San Jose and Sacramento, which both have licensed dispensaries and ordinances in place to regulate them.

And it means paying workers fair wages and benefits.

“We’re competing with In-N-Out Burger,” said Kali-rai, noting that the beloved chain pays workers more than $16 an hour in many places and predicting that the industry will have to negotiate labor peace agreements with unions in the future.

“We’re a brand new industry,” Kali-rai said. “We can’t afford to make enemies.”

Fiona Ma, a member of the state’s Board of Equalization and a candidate for state treasurer, thinks the state can help by creating banks to serve cannabis businesses, which right now are forced to pay taxes and fees using cash.

Ma, who moderated a panel at the seminar, said she sees cannabis as the “largest underground economic driver” in the state.

But, she added, so many illegal companies struggle to transition to operating legally because they can be penalize, for example, failing to pay taxes in previous years.

And Frank Louie, the chief operating officer of the state’s Asian-Pacific Chamber of Commerce, thinks that when cities do decide to allow cannabis sales, they need to do a better job of reaching out to underrepresented minorities.

“Diversity and inclusion are a challenge,” he said. “I really do think it’s about education.”"

CARPINTERIA — This picturesque coastal town cradled by mountains and sandy shores is a scene out of a Southern California postcard. Residents of Carpinteria say they feel lucky to live in what they consider a slice of paradise.

But change is in the air. And sometimes, they say, it stinks.

That’s because marijuana has become a new crop of choice in the farmlands surrounding this tight-knit community of 14,000, which has long helped fuel the U.S. cut flower industry.

Residents say a thick, skunk-like odor from the marijuana plants settles over the valley in the evenings and before dawn. To keep out the stench, they have tried stuffing pillows under doors, lighting incense and shutting windows, a reluctant choice since it also keeps out the cool ocean breezes that are part of the town’s allure.

“We don’t want a marijuana smell,” said Xave Saragosa, a 73-year-old retired sheriff’s deputy who was born and raised in the town and lives near a greenhouse that grows marijuana. “We want fresh air.”

Saragosa said the odor pervades his hillside home at night and keeps his wife up coughing.

Carpinteria, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) from Los Angeles, is in the southeast corner of Santa Barbara County, a tourist area famous for its beaches, wine and temperate climate. It’s also becoming known as a haven for cannabis growers.

The county amassed the largest number of marijuana cultivation licenses in California since broad legalization arrived on Jan. 1 — about 800, according to state data compiled by The Associated Press. Two-thirds of them are in Carpinteria and Lompoc, a larger agricultural city about an hour’s drive to the northwest.

Virtually all of Carpinteria’s licenses are for small, “mixed-light” facilities, which essentially means greenhouses.

The result is a large number of licenses but small total acreage. Only about 200 acres of the county’s farmland is devoted to marijuana, compared with tens of thousands sown with strawberries and vegetables, said Dennis Bozanich, who oversees the county’s marijuana planning.

The area’s greenhouses have their roots in Carpinteria’s cut flower industry, which was sapped after the U.S. government granted trade preferences to South American countries in the 1990s to encourage their farmers to grow flowers instead of coca, the plant used to make cocaine.

In an ironic twist, some California flower growers weary of import competition have started trying to grow cannabis, a plant that, like coca, is deemed illicit by the federal government. Others have sold their greenhouses to marijuana investors.

“We have literally no carnation production in the United States any longer because South America grows them so cheaply,” said Kasey Cronquist, chief executive of the California Cut Flower Commission. “Farmers had to move crops, and that is what we have seen happen over time — they’ve gone to crops that are more valuable or more difficult for Ecuador and Colombia to ship.”

Domestic cut flower growers saw their share of the U.S. market drop to 27 percent in 2015 from 58 percent in 1991. Sales of imported cut flowers grew to more than $1 billion during the same period, according to data compiled by the commission.

Greenhouses that once produced flowers are seen as ideal for marijuana. In Carpinteria’s climate, the greenhouses heat and cool easily and inexpensively, and the plants thrive. It takes only about three months to grow cannabis in pots of shredded coconut husks, so farmers can get multiple harvests each year.

In the hills of the so-called Emerald Triangle of Northern California, where most of the state’s pot is grown, there is a single harvest each year.

Some farmers see cannabis as a plant that can help preserve the area’s farming culture, said Mollie Culver, a consultant for the Cannabis Business Council of Santa Barbara County. Many growers live locally and welcomed the county’s recently crafted regulations requiring odor abatement, she said.

“Santa Barbara isn’t like cannabis run amok,” said Jared Ficker, a partner at advocacy group California Strategies who consults with local cannabis growers. “It is actually the most compliant market we’ve seen in the state.”

Some residents said the stench has decreased in recent months as some growers installed systems aimed at reducing the smells. Others said the problem persists.

The county passed rules in February requiring growers to submit odor abatement plans and designate a representative to handle complaints. They are expected to take effect in some county areas this year and in Carpinteria following a review by state coastal regulators.

Californians voted to legalize marijuana in 2016, but counties and cities have a say on whether they allow cannabis production, distribution or sales.

Even before the ballot measure, Santa Barbara County recognized a number of farmers were growing marijuana to supply the state’s medical market. So officials started looking at establishing odor, security and other rules.

“We have a lot of people who are interested in being compliant and getting into the regulated market,” Bozanich said. “If we can continue that kind of relationship where they’re going to stay in the regulated market,” it will be easier to target and eliminate black market growers, he said.

All of the county’s licenses are to grow medical marijuana, Bozanich said, though the state allows some crossover into the adult market.

In Carpinteria, some residents worry property values will fall if the town keeps reeking of pot. They hope the smell will fade as more growers install odor control systems and those who don’t are shut down.

Football recruit pleads with college coaches to see past his medical cannabis medication Toni Stuart, an 80-year-old retired Episcopal priest, said the odor doesn’t creep into the area near the beach where she lives, but she worries about the community changing.

“I would not like Carpinteria to be the ‘cannabis capital’ of Southern California. I like it the way it is. It’s a very quiet, unpretentious beach town,” she said.

“If people want to grow cannabis instead of flowers or avocados or macadamia nuts — I suppose that’s their right. But they’ve got to think about their neighbors.”

But that hasn’t changed since Jan. 1, when recreational sales became legal in California, according to new data. Overall, the percentage of calls about marijuana and pets, as a fraction of all poison center calls, has held at a relatively low level.

TORONTO – With two months to go before recreational cannabis is legalized in Canada on Oct. 17, new data from the country’s national statistics agency is stoking fears about drugged driving and raising questions about the ability of law enforcement officials to detect impairment.

According to Statistics Canada data released last week, 1 in 7 cannabis users with a valid driver’s license has hopped behind the wheel within two hours of consuming the drug at least once within the past three months.

Other surveys from Health Canada and Public Safety Canada in 2017 also revealed that large percentages of Canadians are driving after consuming marijuana. In fact, 1 in 10 respondents of the latter survey said they believed cannabis makes a person “a more careful driver” – a conviction refuted by science.

But while Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada described the Statistics Canada numbers as “alarming,” others say the survey data tells only part of the story since it does not indicate that those who drove after smoking were actually impaired.

Identifying marijuana impairment is a major issue that has beguiled Canadian lawmakers since the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first introduced legislation to legalize the drug in April 2017.

Their attempt to do so is represented by Bill C-46, which overhauled Canada’s impaired driving laws. Under the legislation, drivers with two to five nanograms of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis – per milliliter of blood will face charges, which could result in hefty fines. Drivers exceeding the five-nanogram limit, or with both THC and alcohol in their systems, will face stiffer penalties, including up to 10 years in prison.

The problem, according to Rob De Luca, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s public safety programs, is “that the link between THC levels and impairment is quite loose.”

Cannabis is unlike alcohol, which can be easily and accurately measured by a person’s blood alcohol content levels, experts say. Cannabis metabolizes differently, and factors ranging from body fat levels to personal history with the drug to how it was ingested affect whether a driver is impaired by it.

“Peak impairment does not occur when THC concentration in the blood is at or near peak levels,” a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report to Congress in 2017 found. “In contrast to the situation with alcohol, someone can show little or no impairment at a THC level at which someone else may show a greater degree of impairment.”

An annex to Bill C-46 made the same point, noting, “the science is unable to provide general guidance to drivers about how much cannabis can be consumed before it is unsafe to drive or before the proposed levels would be exceeded.”

Habitual users of the drug and those who ingest it for medicinal purposes are likely to have high THC levels days or even weeks after they last consumed marijuana and long after experiencing its psychoactive effects, De Luca said. Some studies show that even people exposed to second-hand marijuana smoke can test positive for THC.

“There is a very real danger that someone who is not impaired will get caught up in the criminal justice system,” said De Luca, who anticipates Bill C-46 will face a barrage of legal challenges.

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould defended the rules earlier this year. “Until we have definitive scientific evidence around what is a safe level, we’re proceeding on a precautionary basis, saying there is no safe level,” she told the Globe and Mail.

Bill C-46 also grants police officers with reasonable suspicion that a driver is impaired new powers to administer roadside saliva tests, which determine whether a specific drug may be present in a driver’s system. The results are not admissible in court, but failing a test will spur arrest and further examinations at a police station.

Experts say that these tests and the devices used to carry them out are also riddled with problems. The NHTSA report found that “the accuracy and reliability of these devices has not yet been clearly established.”

A bill that would allow police in Vermont to use roadside saliva tests failed earlier this year because of these concerns.

Questions also have been raised about the ability of the devices, which require internal temperatures of at least 4 degrees Celsius (about 39 degrees Fahrenheit) to work, to function given Canada’s climate. A Public Safety Canada pilot study that tested some of these devices found that in 17 percent of cases where the device malfunctioned, temperature was responsible.

Undeterred, lawyers hired by the county appealed Judge Dale Ikeda's ruling.

On Thursday, the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno sided with Ikeda, saying the $99,000 fine against Xiongh Thao could not be imposed.

""Mindboggling,"" Fresno attorney Brenda Linder said of the county's insistence on spending taxpayer money on an ordinance that two judges have now ruled lacks due process.

Linder represents Thao, who was growing 99 medical marijuana plants on his property in Laton when sheriff's deputies showed up on March 3, 2014, saw the marijuana plants, and advised him that as of Feb. 7, 2014, it was illegal for anyone to grow or cultivate marijuana in the county.

""The deputies then left the property and Thao immediately removed and destroyed the plants,"" the appellate ruling says.

Three days later, sheriff's deputies returned to Thao's property and served him with a citation even though his plants were destroyed, the appellate ruling says. The Fresno County Board of Supervisors later fined Thao $1,000 per plant under the county ordinance, which the Board of Supervisors adopted in January 2014.

In his ruling in June 2015, Ikeda said Thao should not have been fined, saying the county's ordinance allows 15 days for removal of the plants.

In its appeal, the county argued that the fines ""are intended to punish the violators whether or not the nuisance is abated within a reasonable time."" The county also said the $1,000 per plant penalty is determined on the date of the inspection and ""can be imposed regardless of when the nuisance was abated.""

But the appellate court said the state's Government Code required the county to give Thao ""a reasonable time to abate the nuisance before imposing the fine."" Further, the justices said, the citation given to Thao ""clearly stated he had 15 days to abate the nuisance before penalties would be imposed and that the penalties would be assessed only if Thao failed to take action to cure the violation.""

In addition, the county argued the fine was justified because Thao's plants were an ""immediate threat to public safety."" But the appellate court noted that the deputies went to Thao's property, saw the plants and left. ""This apparent lack of urgency is inconsistent with an immediate threat to public health and safety,"" the ruling says. ""If the deputies considered the threat immediate, they could have summarily abated the nuisance.""

The county's spokesman, Jordan Scott, said county officials ""respectfully disagree"" with the appellate ruling. Scott said the county has not decided whether to appeal the ruling by Presiding Justice Brad Hill and Justices Herbert Levy and Jennifer Detjen.

Scott noted the the ruling only applies to Thao's case and the county has since amended its ordinance.

""The ruling does not have implications for how the administrative fines under county ordinances are to be assessed,"" Scott said. The appellate ruling also does not overturn any existing ban under the county's medical marijuana ordinance, Scott said."

A check of vendors closest to Fresno County (which has no recreational marijuana outlets) found none where a customer profile was not kept on dispensary computers. That includes an outlet in Woodlake in Tulare County as well as dispensaries in Stanislaus County, Salinas, Santa Cruz, Sacramento and the Bay Area.

When asked why customer profiles were created, several dispensary workers incorrectly stated the information was required under Proposition 64. Others cited it as a customer convenience. All said a customer who did not agree to the terms would be turned away. None of those queried would agree to provide a last name to a Fresno Bee reporter.

Oregon's state law, enacted in 2017, is more direct. It bans data collection and orders that any information collected by vendors be destroyed within 30 days.

Fresno attorney Brenda Linder, who has represented medical marijuana dispensaries, said the recreational outlets ""are probably taking more information than they need."" She added that it may be that dispensaries are taking information needed for sales of medical marijuana.





""It's a holdover from that model,"" she said. ""They are having a hard time shifting over (to recreational marijuana sales).""

Linder said it remains unclear how U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a foe of legal marijuana, will respond in the future to legalization of pot by states, and noted that firearms buyers who consume marijuana should be cautious.

""You either have to not possess (a gun) or make a horrible decision to lie on a firearms application,"" she said.

In December, police in Honolulu gave gun owners who are registered as medical marijuana users 30 days to turn in their firearms, a move the chief later rescinded.

Brandon Combs, an attorney with the Firearms Policy Coalition, said firearms possession while being a marijuana user continues to have ""very serious consequences."" He scoffed at assertions by dispensaries that their data was private and would not be shared with anyone.





""If they are raided by federal authorities, and that (data) is seized, there could be real problem,"" for those in such a database, Combs said. ""It raises massive concerns."""

The Chinese immigrants are all charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana, transportation of marijuana for sale, grand theft and utilities theft.

Each defendant was being held in lieu of $210,000 bail on Wednesday.

According to Murrieta police Lt. Mark Reid, the agency’s Special Enforcement Team became aware of alleged illicit commercial cannabis activity at three separate residences and gathered sufficient evidence to obtain search warrants for each location.

The first warrant was served on Aug. 2 and led to the seizure of 2,800 marijuana plants, as well as evidence that electrical circuitry had been re- routed, resulting in utilities losses of $46,000, Reid said.

He said two other properties — a house on Cardiff Road and a house on Raphael Drive — were targeted by investigators last Friday.

“Inside each of the locations, the team located large illegal marijuana grows and the theft of electricity,” the lieutenant said.

According to Reid, there were indications that an electrical fire had erupted in the garage of one home, but it had been extinguished before causing significant damage.

A total 7,000 cannabis plants in various stages of growth were seized by investigators, according to Reid, who said the estimated total loss stemming from the alleged utilities theft was $200,000.

The defendants were taken into custody at the residences without incident. None have documented prior felony convictions in Riverside County."
71,72,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/tag/marijuana/,Marijuana – Press Enterprise,Here’s a look at what’s legal and what’s not when it comes to marijuana in California cities.
72,73,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/2018/07/10/riverside-permanently-bans-marijuana-dispensaries-outdoor-growing/,"Riverside permanently bans marijuana dispensaries, outdoor growing","No marijuana dispensaries, no commercial marijuana cultivation and no outdoor growing of marijuana will be allowed in Riverside, the City Council decided Tuesday, July 10.

The permanent ban is set to go into effect Aug. 24, about two weeks before the city’s temporary moratorium with similar prohibitions expires.

The 4-3 vote still allows people to use marijuana and to grow up to six plants indoors. California voters decided through Proposition 64, which went into effect in January, that those uses couldn’t be banned. Voters in six of Riverside’s seven wards voted in favor of the state law.

Riverside, though, now bans almost everything marijuana-related that state law allows it to ban. One exception is that cannabis testing will continue to be permitted.

Previously, the city allowed four marijuana plants outside and four more inside, if they were for personal use.

The council’s two-hour debate came after several workshops beginning more than a year ago. Most recently, in March, the council heard a report from Denver police officers and a delegation of Riverside officials who traveled to the Colorado capital to study the effects of marijuana legalization there.

Councilmen Mike Gardner, Andy Melendrez and Mike Soubirous voted against the ban Tuesday. They voted instead for a motion that would have allowed the city to create a new moratorium while it studied the effects of legalization in nearby cities such as Moreno Valley as well as Oregon and Washington. In March, the Moreno Valley City Council voted to approve 27 commercial pot enterprises — eight of them dispensaries.

Riverside City Councilman Chuck Conder, whose ward voted against Proposition 64, said the ban would allow residents who need medical marijuana to get it from other cities, while limiting the crime he associated with marijuana.

“The cost of doing this is not worth the soul of Riverside,” he said. “If they want to go somewhere else to do it, then go.”

In March, officials presented a grim picture of Denver’s legalization, with dramatically increased police staffing struggling to keep up with marijuana-related crime.

Several council members said Tuesday that the presentation seemed one-sided, with Melendrez calling it “scare tactics” and “reefer madness.”

Alex Chrystall, a resident of Conder’s ward, said the meeting left many unanswered questions.

“As an educator, I’m a fierce advocate of critical thinking, and I was alarmed in March by the lack of clear answers and questions,” she told the council Tuesday.

For instance, she said, if allowing marijuana caused such a disaster in Denver, why do voters there continue to support it?

“Why has the City continued its legalization for the past four years?” she said. “If it is such a bad deal, why aren’t the citizens calling for it to be undone?”

Perhaps, she said, it was because the $2.1 million spent on enforcement is dwarfed by the $22.7 million the city collects in marijuana taxes, on top of the state’s marijuana revenues.

Other residents, including Cindy Roth, president and CEO of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, said they supported the ban.

“We heard from many of our businesses about the problems they had in the strip centers next to them (when dispensaries opened),” she said. “Fights breaking out, paraphernalia left out, places where people thought there was a dispensary broken into.”

The city’s Planning Commission voted in May against the change. Planning commissioners said they were frustrated they were asked to vote without receiving the information given to the City Council, according to a summary by David Murray, the city’s principal planner."
73,74,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/2018/06/18/a-proposed-law-would-allow-many-marijuana-business-in-unincorporated-riverside-county/,A proposed law would allow many marijuana businesses in unincorporated Riverside County,"Riverside County is considering a cannabis ordinance that would be among the most permissive in California, allowing just about every type of marijuana business permitted by state law to operate in unincorporated areas.

A draft of the ordinance is set to come before the county Planning Commission at 9 a.m. Wednesday, June 20. The commission will discuss the policies and decide whether to recommend them for approval by the county Board of Supervisors; it’s not clear when, or if, the board will consider the ordinance.

Though Prop. 64 made it legal in California for adults to use cannabis recreationally, the law also gives cities and counties the authority to regulate or ban most other marijuana activities within their borders. The idea of legal cannabis is less popular in Riverside County than in many other parts of the state; just 51 percent of voters in the county voted in favor of Prop. 64, compared with 57 percent approval statewide.

The ordinance being discussed for Riverside County’s unincorporated areas would allow businesses to grow, manufacture, test, distribute and sell marijuana products for both the medical and recreational markets. It also would permit cannabis delivery services, microbusinesses that do multiple activities and cannabis-themed festivals.

There are 58 pages of rules that businesses would need to comply with if they want to set up shop in unincorporated Riverside County. And those rules are in addition to 284 pages of rules issued by the three state agencies charged with regulating the cannabis industry in California.

Cultivation, for example, would only be allowed indoors. All businesses would need major security and odor-control systems. Employees would need to be at least 21 and pass background checks. Also, in Riverside County, retailers would be required to have separate entrances for medical and recreational customers.

The ordinance doesn’t appear to include a cap on the number of businesses allowed in any of the categories. But there are restrictions on zoning.

And the county ordinance would bump up the mandatory distance between marijuana businesses and schools, day care centers or parks, with 1,000-foot separations required rather than the 600-foot requirement in state law. Both moves will limit the number of cannabis businesses allowed in Riverside County simply based on where viable property is available.

To keep county staff from being overwhelmed, officials at a March board workshop suggest limiting the number of dispensary permits in the first year to 19, with a 50-permit limit for growers.

The rules drew criticism from members of the public at the workshop. Many objected to the first-year limit on permits, while others took issue with restrictions on outdoor growing.

The ordinance doesn’t make mention of permitting cannabis lounges, where people can consume marijuana socially the way they can drink alcohol in a bar. The lounges are important, industry advocates say, since Proposition 64 banned all public cannabis consumption and gives landlords the right to regulate marijuana use on private property. That means renters, tourists, and others are often left without a legal place to consume cannabis in California.

The state doesn’t license cannabis lounges, but cities and counties can choose to welcome them. So far, Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs and West Hollywood are among the only places in Southern California with policies in place to allow for cannabis lounges.

Pot events

One permit that might draw a lot of interest in Riverside County is the one that would allow temporary cannabis events to take place.

Under ew state laws, festivals that let guests buy and consume marijuana onsite must be held on one of the 80 county fairgrounds and agricultural districts scattered throughout the state. And event organizers must first get written permission from the local city council, if the venue is in a city boundary, or the county board of supervisors if it’s in an unincorporated area.

The state-owned Lake Perris fairground is in unincorporated Riverside County, which means the county has authority to approve cannabis festivals at the site. With venues in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties so far not welcoming to weed-themed events, this ordinance sets Lake Perris fairgrounds up to become a future hot-spot for cannabis festivals in Southern California.

The ordinance would apply only to businesses that are outside incorporated cities in Riverside County. Anyone who wants to open a marijuana business inside city boundaries would have to comply with that city’s rules for the industry.

If the ordinance passes, Riverside County would be among just 13 percent of California cities and counties that permit recreational marijuana sales.

Only Humboldt, Inyo and Del Norte counties would have slightly more permissive rules on the books, according to a Southern California News Group database of local marijuana policies. Those counties allow adults 21 and over to cultivate up to six cannabis plants for personal use at home indoors or outdoors, while Riverside County blocks all outdoor marijuana gardens.

Imperial County is the only other county in Southern California with such permissive policies on the books.

Complicated issue

Whether and how to regulate marijuana commerce in unincorporated communities has been a thorny issue for the five elected supervisors. Dispensaries, crops and the like are currently banned in unincorporated areas, with a limited exemption for medicinal marijuana.

While several supervisors opposed Prop. 64, there’s also a recognition that cannabis businesses are an unregulated fact of life in areas of the county that aren’t part of a city. The push to regulate cannabis businesses stems largely from the desire to crack down on problems caused, for example, by growers who steal water and electricity and generate noxious odors that annoy neighbors.

The board also has heard from cannabis entrepreneurs who see the potential for a booming new industry in the county’s vast swaths of rural acreage.

Originally, the board planned to put a ballot measure before voters in November that would have imposed a local tax on marijuana to pay for regulatory efforts. If the tax failed, the ban on marijuana would have stayed in place.

In March, supervisors voted 3-2 to ditch the tax and use fees from individual agreements with developers to fund enforcement efforts for the new ordinance. That concerns Lanny Swerdlow, a longtime marijuana activist from Whitewater.

“If the ‘fee’ looks like a tax, walks like a tax and smells like a tax then it is a tax and bypassing a vote by calling a tax a ‘community benefit fee’ or any other name is forbidden by Prop. 218,” which requires voter approval of local taxes, Swerdlow wrote in a blog post.

Supervisor Chuck Washington, who championed the developer agreement plan, argued a ballot measure, estimated to cost $750,000, was too costly and allowed all votes in a county of 2.4 million to decide land-use law for 379,000 people who live in unincorporated areas.

IF YOU GO

The Riverside County Planning Commission, in a public meeting, will review a proposed ordinance that would allow and regulate marijuana commerce in the county’s unincorporated areas.

The county Board of Supervisors will have the final say on whether the ordinance becomes law.

About this project

Marijuana laws in California can vary widely from one city to the next, making it tough for residents to know where they can shop for legal cannabis, open a marijuana business or even what they can do in their own homes.

That’s because, while Californians have been free to carry up to an ounce of marijuana and consume it in private since Proposition 64 passed in November 2016, state law gives local governments full authority to regulate or ban most other marijuana activity in their borders.

We asked about local rules for all types of cannabis businesses, since cities (or counties, if the proposed address is in an unincorporated area) can choose to regulate these operations or ban them entirely.

We also asked cities and counties about regulations they’ve imposed on the right (per Prop. 64) of residents 21 and older to grow up to six marijuana plants per home out of public view, since local governments can ban outdoor gardens and add other “reasonable” regulations.

We used the policy information to give cities and counties a score from zero to 100, with zero for cities that are as strict as they can be under state law and 100 for cities that are the most permissive. (Learn more about that methodology here.)

A patchwork of municipal codes can be seen in the map below, with concentrations of high-scoring, cannabis-friendly cities found in central Los Angeles County and the county seats of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino. Cities in the Coachella Valley and elsewhere in the desert also have opted to nurture marijuana businesses.

Citizens of some cities heavily favored Proposition 64 in 2016 — others largely opposed it. The following graph shows how residents’ votes on the new state law jibe with that city’s home grow and business regulations, from the city of Industry, where there was little enthusiasm for Proposition 64 and local marijuana rules are strict, to Palm Springs, where nearly three-in-four voted for the initiative and every type of cannabis business can set up shop.

What’s next?

We’ll be updating the database frequently, with cities and counties passing new cannabis regulations each week.

75,76,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/2018/07/07/a-tale-of-marijuana-in-two-inland-cities/,A tale of marijuana in two Inland cities,"Governments across the Inland Empire are continuing to grapple with the problem of marijuana prohibition versus regulation, even after majorities of voters in both Riverside and San Bernardino counties backed statewide legalization in 2016.

Voters, in approving Proposition 64, made their thoughts clear on the issue of whether the farce of marijuana prohibition should continue or not. While some Inland communities, like Palm Springs, were well ahead of the pack long before Proposition 64 was passed by permitting medical marijuana dispensaries, most others are still lagging behind.

Take, for example, the city of Riverside. Most voters supported marijuana legalization. Yet on July 10, the city council will discuss prohibition of all marijuana businesses except for laboratory testing facilities. On May 31, the city’s own planning commission rejected the proposal to prohibit marijuana, but Councilmen Chuck Conder and Steve Adams want to ignore the views of the public and proceed with prohibition anyway.

While they’re understandably concerned with the potential public safety impacts of broader, legal access to marijuana, pretending prohibition in Riverside will keep marijuana out of the city is obviously mistaken. People will continue to purchase marijuana in and around Riverside on a legal and illegal basis, and consume it.

No apologies necessary for being a Catholic — the Church needs to apologize

California takes the prize for environmental virtue signaling — but not much else The question is whether Riverside wants to bring the black market above ground and collect revenues from legal businesses to help mitigate any deleterious impacts of legal marijuana. That’s the matter at hand.

Meanwhile, in the city of San Bernardino, marijuana legalization and regulation continues to be an overly complicated matter. Back in 2014, City Attorney Gary Saenz sought to “present a plan which essentially acknowledges the futility and high cost” of prohibition. Just as it appeared that effort was gaining momentum, it was silently killed.

Fast forward four years later, majorities of San Bernardino voters have approved two legalization measures for the city, the prevailing measure was struck down in court, the city has put in place ordinances of their own and now they’re facing legal challenges and the prospect of even more ballot initiatives.

Such a disjointed state of affairs is unfortunately one consequence of governments failing to heed the wishes of the public, accept the futility of prohibition and make legalization work."

An association representing the church and about 15 others like it fired back Friday, April 13, filing a claim against the city seeking $1.2 million in damages and alleging harassment and discrimination. Church leaders say they smoke marijuana or eat edibles as part of spiritual meditation as a religious sacrament, but city officials say they’re using religion as a front for selling pot.

City Manager Gary Thompson said Jurupa Valley’s city attorney is reviewing the claim. Such a claim is often a precursor to the filing of a lawsuit.

The church’s move comes as the city is pushing for a final decision to wrap up a suit Jurupa Valley brought in Riverside County Superior Court in early 2017 against what it maintains is an illegal dispensary. The Vault incorporated as a church in January and, as of Monday, April 16, was advertising on Weedmaps.

The feud also comes weeks before city voters will be asked in June to choose between dueling ballot measures and determine whether commercial cannabis enterprises should be allowed in Jurupa Valley. Marijuana businesses of all types are banned now.

Church officials say the battle is essentially a case of religious persecution through municipal zoning laws, that violate the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000.

Brent Fraser, a founder of the The Association of Sacramental Ministeries of which the Vault Church of Open Faith belongs, said city officials are singling out the Jurupa Valley fellowship because it uses marijuana as a sacrament in meditative and other religious exercises.

And it’s not fair, Fraser said.

“We don’t ever question when they serve wine to minors at Catholic churches,” he said. “No one’s trying to shut them down. That doesn’t happen to the Catholic Church because that is their sacrament.”

Fraser said cannabis has historically been used by other religions for many years, and it’s a genuine expression of the Jurupa Valley church’s faith.

“It’s not a trick or anything like that,” Fraser said. “What law enforcement tends to do is think that everyone is faking it so that they can get stoned. That’s just not true.

“These are not dispensaries. They are spiritual centers. They are healing centers,” he said.

Cannabis-oriented churches have begun to proliferate across the state in the wake of the legalization of recreational marijuana, which took effect at the first of the year after passage of Proposition 64, a 2016 ballot measure.

Thompson, the city manager, said the Vault continues to operate as a dispensary in a city that bars any type of marijuana enterprise. Despite recreational marijuana becoming legal across the state, municipalities have the ability to permit or ban cannabis businesses in their communities.

“The bottom line is they are selling marijuana illegally,” Thompson said. “We have proof of that.”

Court documents state that a city undercover investigator purchased marijuana Dec. 28, 2016. Shortly afterwards, the city sued the Vault.

“At that time, it was never identified as a religious establishment,” Thompson said.

Matthew Pappas, attorney for the Lake Forest-based association, said, “It was a secular dispensary before. That is true. We’re not going to say that it wasn’t.”

But he said the Vault has undergone a conversion since.

According to state records, the Vault Church of Open Faith filed articles of incorporation with the California secretary of state on Jan. 19 of this year.

Conversion and incorporation aside, Thompson said the Vault appears to still be selling pot.

“This particular location is also advertising on Weedmaps,” Thompson said. “It just seems kind of odd that any religious organization would sell a sacrament when it is administered as part of a religious ceremony.”

The Weedmaps marijuana sales website listed The Vault Church at 5024 Etiwanda (Ave.) as a dispensary. Various strains of pot were listed as being for sale for $40 for an eighth of an ounce, and for $80 for a quarter ounce. Some were priced lower; some higher.

Pappas, the attorney, said the Vault reluctantly allowed Weedmaps to classify the church as a dispensary in its directory.

“Weedmaps doesn’t have a church category,” Pappas said, saying he hopes to change that.

He said the church is using the Weedmaps listing as a tool for its missionary outreach.

“Weedmaps happens to be a venue that people go to when they are looking for cannabis,” he said. “We are trying to grow the membership of the church.”

As for the church, it’s a small one that meets in the corner of a converted single-family residence in Jurupa Valley.

Services are Sunday mornings. Cannabis, said Fraser, enters into the worship picture typically during a meditative or similar exercise.

On Sunday, April 15, several members smoked pot during the service and at one point a minister helped a member smoke the cannabis sacrament through a pipe.

Fraser said there are about 15 other churches within the circle of fellowship that includes the Vault Church of Open Faith. Most are in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, with a few in Washington state. Several more are expected to form shortly, he said.

“The churches are not just a place where you pick up your weed and split,” Fraser said.

They are places where genuine worship and fellowship is practiced, he said, saying the faith is less about a particular deity than about extolling virtues such as kindness, compassion, nurturing and a spirit of brotherhood.

“Whatever you call your God, bring your God here,” Fraser said. “We will find a way to harmonize, rather than to fight with you.”

“The moniker of open faith means that we welcome everybody,” he said."
77,78,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/2018/05/08/temecula-intends-to-keep-ban-on-marijuana-businesses/,Temecula intends to keep ban on marijuana businesses,"Don’t expect Temecula to alter its ban on marijuana dispensaries anytime soon.

After learning in a poll that the majority of residents support the prohibition of commercial marijuana activities, the Temecula City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night, May 8, to keep the city’s ban in place.

The council also asked officials to look at tightening Temecula’s policy on allowing medical marijuana deliveries without making it more difficult for patients to get their medication.

The vote came more than an hour after city leaders heard the results of a poll asking about 1,000 Temecula residents for their views on issues involving marijuana.

Sharon Pinkerton, of Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz and Associates, said that 55 percent of residents backed the city’s ban on commercial marijuana activities.

The council adopted its ban, which includes the distribution, manufacturing and sale of marijuana, in June 2017.

Pinkerton also said a majority of poll respondents oppose bringing medical or recreational marijuana dispensaries into the city.

About 52 percent did not support the idea of letting stores in Temecula sell medical marijuana, Pinkerton said. Roughly 61 percent opposed the idea of stores selling marijuana for recreational use.

The results came almost three months after the city’s cannabis subcommittee, whose members include Mayor Matt Rahn and Mayor Pro Tem Mike Naggar, supported a poll to get residents’ views on cannabis, a city report states.

However, residents who responded to the survey didn’t agree entirely with the city’s complete ban on commercial pot activity.

Nearly 70 percent said they supported laboratories that tested cannabis-related products for safety but did not sell products directly to residents, a city report states.

At its meeting, the council asked city officials to look at the laboratory component to see if it fit in with the city’s master plan.

In addition, residents supported patients getting access to medical cannabis, but not through dispensaries. The city voted not to ban medical marijuana deliveries last year.

Though the city has banned commercial pot activities, it has allowed cultivation of up to 12 cannabis plants by patients and their caregivers if certain standards are met, the report states.

In accordance with Prop. 64, the city allows residents to grow up to six plants indoors. Prop. 64 legalized recreational marijuana while giving cities and counties wide authority to enact the law.

BY THE NUMBERS

1,037: Number of Temecula residents likely to vote in November 2018 who were surveyed online and by phone.

55 percent: Number who support the city’s existing ban on marijuana businesses.

71 percent: Number who support selling medical marijuana products recommended to patients by doctors. However, 52 percent did not support the city allowing storefront medical marijuana dispensaries to open.

68 percent: Number who favor the city letting laboratories test marijuana products for safety and quality but not sell directly to customers. Labs testing marijuana products are prohibited in Temecula.

TEMECULA’S POT POLICY

The city has banned medicinal and recreational marijuana businesses, including dispensaries, but there are exceptions.

Delivery: Medical marijuana can be delivered to qualified patients and caregivers.

Cultivation: Under Proposition 64, residents may grow up to six pot plants inside a single-family detached home or in an enclosed outdoor structure for recreational use. Growing plants outdoors is prohibited.

Exemption: There’s a ban exception for medical cannabis for qualified patients and caregivers. For these individuals, up to 12 plants can be grown per patient or caregiver per residence. The maximum is 24 plants per residence.

On Tuesday, the Riverside City Council voted 4 to 3 to prohibit marijuana businesses in the city.

In doing so, the Riverside City Council made clear that it is incapable of properly representing the will of the public on marijuana policy. Most Riverside voters supported Proposition 64 in 2016, including majorities of voters in six of the city’s seven city council wards.

Councilmen Steve Adams and Chuck Conder in particular indulged in plenty of reefer madness. Channeling the comical fearmongering of the 1930s over marijuana, they whipped up concerns about crime, about the children, about murder. It’s a worldview that puts them not only in the minority in Riverside, but in the country.

There’s a reason increasing numbers of states have pursued and implemented marijuana legalization. There’s a reason Democrats and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly united to introduce federal marijuana decriminalization bills. And there’s a reason President Trump has indicated his support for ending federal marijuana prohibition and leaving it to the states.

Most people understand that prohibition is a failure, that prohibition doesn’t mean that marijuana just goes away and that prohibition ultimately does more harm than good. But Chuck Conder, Steve Adams, Jim Perry and Chris MacArthur aren’t among them, and see it as their responsibility to perpetuate the folly of prohibition.

In contrast, other members of the council seemed to at least understand that rushing to prohibition does the public a disservice.

Councilman Mike Soubirous, for example, noted that the city could just as easily prohibit liquor stores on the same grounds the marijuana prohibitionists wanted to prohibit marijuana. What an absurdity that would be — right? Now carry that recognition of absurdity to the proposed marijuana prohibition. Same issues at hand.

No apologies necessary for being a Catholic — the Church needs to apologize

California takes the prize for environmental virtue signaling — but not much else Neither prohibition nor legalization are a panacea, but legalization offers more control and revenue to address the negative consequences of marijuana or alcohol use, while mitigating the black market and all that comes with it.

Councilman Andy Melendrez, meanwhile, rightly called out the “scare tactics” and incomplete information gathering to justify prohibition. While the prohibitionists cited everything negative about marijuana legalization in Colorado, they didn’t offer the other side of things. Nor did the council adequately consider the experiences of the other states that have legalized marijuana — or even their own neighbors.

Last I checked, the sky hasn’t fallen in Palm Springs after several years of permitting medical marijuana dispensaries to operate.

Alas, there’s no good in looking to the Riverside City Council for leadership on this issue in keeping with the views of the majority of Riverside voters. It’s apparent a ballot initiative will be needed to do the work the council is unwilling and incapable of doing.

79,80,CA,www.pe.com,https://www.pe.com/2018/07/11/hemet-voters-could-see-three-marijuana-initiatives-in-november/,Hemet voters could see three marijuana initiatives in November,"Hemet voters could see three cannabis-related initiatives on the November ballot after the City Council on Tuesday, July 10, decided to create its own measure to combat two other proposed measures.

One measure to legalize marijuana-related businesses has already qualified for the ballot and a second has been proposed. Both are citizen-driven and would end the city’s ban of all marijuana-related businesses.

“Philosophically, I’m opposed to someone coming in and riding roughshod on our city and putting an initiative that shoves their business down our throat,” Councilman Russ Brown said. “It’s coming, we can either control it or have it jammed down our throat.”

Both measures are more lenient about security and where the businesses could be than the city would like. One would allow retail sales.

Further complicating matters is the fact that backers of the second measure are suing the backers of the first measure, alleging it would create a monopoly.

After hearing reports about a community survey on marijuana-based business and projected revenues, council members said they were more comfortable with only allowing medical marijuana-related businesses.

“We need to take this opportunity to put it on the ballot and make our own rules,” Councilwoman Karlee Meyer said.

The survey by FM3 Research showed confusion about marijuana businesses among the 653 people interviewed. The majority of respondents do not know it is illegal to operate a medical marijuana dispensary or recreational marijuana business in the city.

Fifty percent of respondents favored allowing such businesses; 47 percent were opposed and 3 percent were undecided.

When it came to the types of businesses, 72 percent of respondents supported dispensaries that sell medical marijuana, but just 44 percent backed selling pot for recreational use.

People who favor cannabis businesses cite the revenue the city could take in and the medicinal benefits of the substance while those oppose cited concerns about crime and safety.

The financial analysis showed the city could take in from $815,000 to $11.6 million a year, based on the numbers, type and size of businesses allowed. From 117 to 1,400 jobs could be created in marijuana and ancillary businesses, the study reported.

If voters approve more than one initiative, the one receiving the most votes would win. If none pass, the city’s ban on all marijuana-related businesses would stay in place.

The decision came on the same day that the city of Riverside permanently banned marijuana dispensaries and outdoor growing.

80,81,AL,www.tuscaloosanews.com,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20180807/opinion-officials-weigh-in-on-marijuana-permit-applicants,Opinion: Officials weigh in on marijuana permit applicants,"Louisiana's burgeoning medical marijuana industry could be a booming future business for some entrepreneurs, so when pharmacists and their business partners were vying for the state's limited dispensary permits, they sought to leverage their relationships.

Pharmacy permit applicants provided letters of recommendation from a U.S. senator, state lawmakers, sheriffs, high-profile community members, health professionals, and anyone else they thought could help make their bids successful, according to documents provided to The Associated Press in response to a public records request.

Those written references seemed to carry minimal, if any sway, with the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy when sifting through the 21 applicants that eventually competed for nine permits around the state. Some applicants with heavyweight backers didn't get a medical marijuana permit, while others without pedigreed recommendations won dispensing authority.

Still, the letters offer a glimpse into the ways politicians weigh in on high-profile regulatory issues behind the scenes and how business leaders think those relationships can be beneficial.

The highest-profile endorsement came from U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, who offered his backing to Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies for a permit in the Lafayette region. The company also had letters of support from Attorney General Jeff Landry, House Speaker Taylor Barras and Lafayette Mayor-President Joel Robideaux, among others.

""I can say with confidence that Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies has the knowledge and experience to operate a medical marijuana pharmacy that is above reproach and compliant with all state rules and regulations,"" Barras wrote.

Robideaux also wrote a letter of recommendation for competing applicant The Apothecary Shoppe. Landry wrote a ""character reference"" to support a doctor involved in two medical marijuana proposals, for Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies and Calcasieu Therapeutics in Lake Charles.

Landry wrote that the doctor, J. Kevin Duplechain, ""has been a trusted caretaker for several of my family members. Additionally, he has been a loyal friend and someone I can rely upon for sage advice.""

Neither of the Landry-backed applications was selected for a dispensing permit.

Though it won't be located in his area, West Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Mike Cazes gave his backing to Hope Pharmacy for a northwest Louisiana-based permit. Cazes wrote that he's known co-owner and commissioned sheriff's deputy Chris Whittington for two decades.

""I have been in law enforcement my entire life, and I am confident that if Mr. Whittington observes any improprieties whatsoever in the medical marijuana industry in general, and the pharmacy in particular, he will take all steps necessary to immediately correct it,"" Cazes wrote.

Hope Pharmacy was selected for the permit.

Medical marijuana is expected to be available to Louisiana patients in the fall, after years of start-up work.

Under a law passed in 2015 and tweaked twice since then, Louisiana is allowing therapeutic cannabis to treat a long list of diseases and disorders, such as cancer, epilepsy, intractable pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson's disease. Marijuana can be available in medicinal oils, pills, liquids, sprays and topical applications, but cannot be sold in a form to be smoked.

Only the agricultural centers at LSU and Southern University are allowed to grow the product. LSU estimates its vendor will have the first medical marijuana products available within months.

By capping the number of dispensing pharmacies at 10, lawmakers placed a premium on permits. The pharmacy board said that to ensure equitable access, it allocated one permit to each of nine state health regions. The 10th permit may be issued later.

Permits were granted to H&W Drug Store in New Orleans; Capitol Wellness Solutions in Baton Rouge; Green Leaf Dispensary in Houma; The Apothecary Shoppe in Lafayette; Medicis in Lake Charles; The Medicine Cabinet Pharmacy in Alexandria; Hope Pharmacy in Shreveport; Delta Medmar in West Monroe; and Willow Pharmacy in Madisonville.

Exactly why each applicant was chosen is somewhat shrouded in secrecy. Portions of the applications are considered confidential and exempt from public records law, and parts of the evaluations were done behind closed doors.

Asked if recommendations from elected officials were important in influencing decision-making, pharmacy board executive director Malcolm Broussard wouldn't say.

""To answer those questions, I would need to disclose comments made during executive session,"" Broussard wrote in an email.

81,82,AL,www.tuscaloosanews.com,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20171211/city-leaders-marijuana-proposal-makes-sense,City leaders' marijuana proposal makes sense,"The biggest problem with an effort by Tuscaloosa leaders to relax penalties for marijuana possession is that it makes entirely too much sense. Well, that, and the fact that Tuscaloosa leaders don’t have home rule and can’t make such a change without the Legislature voting to approve it. That means it would be needlessly politicized with the usual banter of misinformation that often stymies any effort for sensible change in our state.

Last Thursday, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox and the City Council hosted state lawmakers from West Alabama for an annual breakfast that traditionally happens shortly before the legislators begin a session.

One of the topics discussed was the problem Tuscaloosa has with jail overcrowding. This city is not alone in that. It is a problem throughout the state, but here locally it is at a crisis level. The mayor noted that the criminal justice system is overwhelmed. A huge contributing factor in that problem is that in Alabama if you’re caught with even a small amount of marijuana, state law says you’ve got to be locked up.

More than half the nation has legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, 29 states so far. Seven states, and Washington, D.C., have legalized it for recreational use. A number of states have decriminalized the possession of a small amount of cannabis. Cities in neighboring states, such as Nashville, Memphis and Atlanta, have relaxed laws so that possession of a small amount is still illegal but there’s a fine instead of jail time.

But here in Alabama, where our prisons are so overcrowded the federal government is threatening to step in and take them over, we still lock people up for small amounts of weed. As a result, valuable resources are spent on an effort that actually makes our streets less safe.

“We don’t need to be tying officers up on this,” Maddox said, explaining that the effort to arrest and jail someone isn’t worth the effort, time and money. “We need to deal with this in a different pattern besides throwing someone in jail.”

Most states where marijuana is still illegal have found it much more effective to have police just confiscate the marijuana and write a ticket. It’s been that way a few miles down the road in Mississippi for many years, where the first offense for up to 30 grams, or a little more than an ounce, is a $250 fine. Actually, Mississippi decriminalized small amounts way back in 1978.

The city’s proposal wouldn’t legalize weed. It wouldn’t make it more prevalent. It wouldn’t lead to more drug use. It wouldn’t even change the penalties associated with a misdemeanor charge of possession.

All it would do would be to free up hours of police officers’ shifts so they could spend time enforcing other laws, free up jail space and otherwise help prevent the waste and misuse of valuable resources.

It’s a good idea and like many other good ideas, it is likely to get drowned out by half-truths and rhetoric in Alabama."
82,83,AL,www.tuscaloosanews.com,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20171207/tuscaloosa-seeks-citation-not-jail-for-minor-marijuana-offenders,"Tuscaloosa seeks citation, not jail, for minor marijuana offenders","Tuscaloosa city leaders are seeking help from state legislators on a number of topics, from protecting Lake Tuscaloosa to shoring up losses in sales tax collections.

The city also is pushing to relax the penalties associated with possessing small amounts of marijuana.

The council hosts a breakfast for the area's members of the Alabama Legislature each year before the legislative session begins.

During the Tuscaloosa City Council’s Legislative Breakfast on Thursday, Mayor Walt Maddox, City Attorney Glenda Webb and others highlighted several issues that are facing City Hall.

Among them is the requirement that anyone caught with marijuana, no matter how small an amount, must be arrested and booked into jail.

That takes up a lot of hours and bedspace in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, both of which could be used toward more serious matters, Maddox said.

“With the collapse of the corrections system and mental health, our criminal justice system is overwhelmed,” Maddox said. “We don’t need to be tying officers up on this. … We need to deal with this in a different pattern besides throwing someone in jail.”

“This allows us to do that, to focus on other crimes to continue to make Tuscaloosa safe.”

Maddox and the City Council are not pushing to decriminalize the substance. In fact, none of the penalties associated with the misdemeanor possession of marijuana would be altered.

Rather, the city is seeking a change in how police must deal with those who are found with relatively small amounts of the drug. And Maddox said he’s willing to allow the Legislature to decide how little of an amount would qualify for the citation.

About six of the state House of Representative and Senate members who represent portions of Tuscaloosa were in attendance for the breakfast, which the City Council hosts prior to the start of each session of the Alabama Legislature.

The 2018 session begins Jan. 9 – the second Tuesday in January – because this is the final year of the quadrennial, or four-year term of the elected delegation.

It begins earlier in the fourth year to allow legislators time to complete the session and return home to campaign for an additional term.

This year’s breakfast was sparsely attended by the Tuscaloosa delegates. But of those who did show, some seemed willing to at least explore the city’s request on dealing with marijuana offenders.

“I’ve always been a big proponent of decriminalizing marijuana,” said Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro.

“We’ve got so many people sitting in our jails for small amounts of marijuana.

“Where you have many states that are making it legal now, we have to look at that in the state of Alabama in terms of our overcrowdedness – I think we could see a big reduction – and I think this is a great step toward the city of Tuscaloosa looking at the seriousness of this crime but also allowing people who have just committed some minor incident to themselves by smoking a small amount of marijuana not to be filling our jails up.”

Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, also said he believed the move to be a good idea.

England reiterated Maddox’s point about how much time – sometimes hours – of an officer’s shift is spent on arresting, transporting and jailing someone caught with marijuana, no matter the amount.

Allowing police to ticket those who have small amounts of the substance could reduce the officer’s engagement to about 45 minutes, England said.

“It’s a public safety issue,” England said. “It’s more efficient and it actually keeps people out of jail who probably shouldn’t be there, anyway.”

Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, wasn’t as enthusiastic as his fellow lawmakers.

Poole, who chairs the state House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Education Committee, said changing how marijuana possession is policed at the local level would require a statewide change – not just one for Tuscaloosa – and doing so would demand a lot of consideration.

“That would be a new proposal,” Poole said. “I haven’t seen anything like that in the Legislature. I think it would have a long way to go.

“I think there’s a lot of analysis that would have to go into a proposal like that, and lot of public input. You’d have to really put it out there and have a public discussion on an issue like that.”

Maddox touched on a number of other issues, as well.

He asked the Legislature for help in regulating restaurants that, during the evening, transition into a more bar-like atmosphere. Currently, there is no license available through the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to indicate such a change.

Creating one, the mayor said, would allow those living or working near these establishments to have a better understanding of what’s moving in next door.

Maddox also voiced the City Council’s opposition toward eliminating prescription drug transactions from a pharmacy’s overall gross receipts. These sale totals are used to set business license fees and factoring out these sales would hurt municipalities.

He estimated Tuscaloosa would lose about $200,000 each year.

“And it’s not the mom-and-pop (pharmacies) that will benefit,” Maddox said. “It’s your large, out-of-state corporations that will gain the benefit of this.”

Webb highlighted the city’s wish for legal liability limits extended to city employees as they are now for state or county workers.

She also said the city would like clear legislation granting municipalities the authority to enforce parking regulations as civil citations. Now, cities are relying on a non-binding attorney general’s opinion to collect parking fees.

Maddox also asked the delegation to consider altering the distribution model of the Simplified Sellers Use Tax and Remittance Program (SSUT), a voluntary program through which online retailers can pay a flat, reduced tax rate on certain online sales.

Under this program, the state gets 50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent is divided among counties and 25 percent among cities, based on population.

Currently, about 150 businesses – or about 1 percent of those that actually conduct business online in Alabama – have signed on to the program.

And based on the collections and distribution model, the city of Tuscaloosa received about $409,000 in SSUT proceeds while Tuscaloosa County got about $533,000 in fiscal 2017.

Maddox said this is unfair, primarily because most of the retail centers of a county lie within the corporate limits of municipalities.

“Commercial sales have nothing to do with population. Commercial sales have everything to do with where those sales are occurring,” Maddox said.

And unless some sweeping changes are made to how online sales are taxed in Alabama, the entire state stands to suffer, Maddox said.

“Sales tax is analogous to a comet hitting the earth. The comet has hit the earth, and sales taxes are the dinosaurs,” Maddox said. “We’re all going to be impacted by it, from Huntsville to Mobile.”

Officers found 0.08 grams of marijuana locked in a safe after freshman tight end Major Tennison let them search his room in the athletic dorm late Jan. 28.

Tennison, 19, was in his first-floor room at Bryant Hall when an officer working in the lobby smelled marijuana at 11:21 p.m., according to records filed Friday in Tuscaloosa County District Court.

The officer knocked on the door to the room because it is adjacent to the lobby, according to the report. Tennison allowed him inside, and admitted he had smoked marijuana after the officer noticed residue on a table.

The officer read Tennison his rights at 11:38 p.m. before asking if there was any more marijuana in the room. Tennison first said no, according to the report, but then told him there was some left in the locked safe on the table.

A police supervisor arrived at the dorm at 11:43 p.m. and searched the room, without finding anything else. The officers tested and weighed the marijuana, reporting that it was 0.08 grams -- about a quarter of the amount in an average-sized joint.

Drug enforcement agents in Tuscaloosa County seized 78 types of drugs with a total street value exceeding $1 million last year.

The West Alabama Narcotics Task Force arrested 1,677 suspects on 3,121 drug-related charges in 2014, according to year-end numbers released by Tuscaloosa Police on Thursday. They arrested fewer people in 2014 than 2013, but brought more charges overall. In 2013, the unit charged 1,980 people with 3,003 drug offenses.

West Alabama Narcotics Task Force commander Capt. Wayne Robertson attributed the rising number of cases to the growing population in Tuscaloosa County and increased enrollment at the University of Alabama.

“I think it's just our aggressive approach on drugs in Tuscaloosa County that's causing these numbers to rise,” he said.

Marijuana was the most common drug offense in the county. Agents seized nearly 91 pounds, or 41,114 grams, of it. They seized nearly eight pounds of synthetic marijuana, herbal substances treated with chemicals to mimic the effects of pot when smoked.

Robertson said that the unit will focus on making arrests related to the sale of heroin and synthetic marijuana this year.

“Those are the drugs we're most worried about right now,” he said. “They're the two drugs that we'll be really going after in 2015.

Robertson attributed the rising use of heroin to the recent rise of prescription drug abuse. Many users have turned to the harder drug to get high, he said.

Agents in 2014 seized 7,492 Hydrocodone pills and 24 grams of heroin.

“Heroin is a bad drug, probably one of the most dangerous drugs I've seen, due to the purity of it,” Robertson said. “We have a lot of young people who are using this drug who aren't familiar with it and it's killing them. That worries me.”

Decades ago, heroin use was more concentrated in poorer communities, he said, but has not spread to almost every socioeconomic group.

Robertson said that the unit will focus on combatting heroin and synthetic marijuana, which he said is almost as dangerous.

“I call it potpourri with chemicals on it,” he said. “We have a lot of overdoses. Young kids think that it's not harmful, but it is. Most of the time young people, or even older people, don't know what they're smoking.” The unit made a few major cases last year when they busted suspects with several thousands of packages of synthetic pot.

Agents are beginning to see more ice, a more pure form of methamphetamine, moving into the city limits, Robertson said. Meth was more common in rural areas in past years, he said, and was often homemade by the users.

“We're now seeing a more pure form coming across our borders,” Robertson said.

Agents seized 613 grams of meth oil last year. They seized 970 grams of powder and crack cocaine.

Robertson estimates the street value of the confiscated drugs is about $1.1 million.

The task force seized $861,131 of cash and items they believe were related to drug transactions. Judges have forfeited $297,852 of that to the unit, which uses it to pay informants and for training, equipment, undercover operations, vehicles and staff.

“It saves taxpayers a lot of money every year because we're able to take this money that's been made selling illegal drugs,” Robertson said.

The 16-member unit is staffed by agents from the Tuscaloosa, Northport and University of Alabama police departments, the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office and Tuscaloosa County District Attorney's Office. WANTF conducted 69 educational programs within the county to educate children and adults about the dangers of narcotics, TPD spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley said.

Mangino: A looming showdown: Guns or marijuana,"Pennsylvania residents can now legally use marijuana for medical purposes. Some 10,000 Pennsylvanians are now literally card-carrying marijuana users.

.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }

Pennsylvania residents can now legally use marijuana for medical purposes. Some 10,000 Pennsylvanians are now literally card-carrying marijuana users. If you have the card you can access marijuana for any one of 17 different serious health conditions.

That is great news for people with cancer, epilepsy or Crohn's disease to name a few. The news is not so good for gun buyers or owners who need cannabis treatment.

As the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette put it, “(S)ome sick people will have to make a difficult decision: Is taking the medicine worth surrendering what gun-owning advocates see as an enshrined constitutional right?”

Under federal law, all forms of marijuana use remains a crime. The Drug Enforcement Administration considers marijuana a Schedule 1 drug, in the same category with cocaine, heroin and LSD. Marijuana and the other illicit drugs remain illegal on a federal level because there are “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”

As a result, marijuana use eliminates an individual from buying or owning a gun. The names of those card-carrying marijuana users will have their name in a Pennsylvania database that will be accessible to gun dealers.

If a name comes up as a marijuana user, the individual is disqualified from purchasing a firearm. In fact, the U.S Justice Department keeps records of gun purchases and the application asks specific questions about marijuana use, with the following warning:

“The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.”

Evidently the federal government doesn’t realize that 29 states and Washington, D.C. have legalized some form of marijuana use.

What’s worse — in a state with a long history of vigorously defending the Second Amendment — Ryan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police told the Post-Gazette “It’s unlawful to keep possession of firearms obtained prior to registering.”

The police can confiscate a registered marijuana user’s gun.

The feds don’t seem to be backing off. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that previous Obama-era policies of non-interference with states that have legalized marijuana are ""unnecessary.""

In a memo, the attorney general called marijuana ""dangerous"" and activity surrounding the drug to be a ""serious crime.""

He has encouraged U.S. Attorneys to vigorously pursue illegal drug cases including those that involve the use and distribution of marijuana.

The problem is reverberating nationwide. The Maryland State Police, who oversee gun ownership in the state, ask prospective gun buyers if they have a medical marijuana card. According to the Baltimore Sun, buyers must allow the state health department to disclose whether they have applied for a card.

The Honolulu Police Department’s plan to confiscate guns from medical marijuana users has been put on hold. The police sent a series of letters to medical marijuana card holders, demanding they surrender all firearms. According to Hawaii News Now, the policy has been met with strong opposition and will be reevaluated by state police officials.

The National Rifle Association has not taken a position on the issue, yet. With nearly 60 percent of states authorizing marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes the gun issue is not going away. This has the ability to pit long-time “law and order” pols against NRA supporters who are also reliable benefactors.

Must one be forced to choose between medicine and a gun? Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolfe has made it clear—not in his state.

“The federal government needs to do the right thing here,” Wolfe told Public Radio’s WESA-FM in Pittsburgh. “We’re not going to take their [medical marijuana users] guns away.""

A Senate committee on Wednesday approved a bill lessening marijuana punishments after a short but emotional debate that suggests the legislation will run into obstacles if it reaches the floor.

The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill, sponsored by Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road, on a 6 to 4 vote. The bill makes possession of an ounce or less of marijuana subject to a fine, not jail time, and alters punishments for possession of higher amounts.

A House committee on Wednesday rejected an almost identical bill from Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, on a 7 to 5 vote.

‘We are arresting more people for marijuana than for opioids,” Brewbaker told the committee. “Right now, the situation we are in, I think this is a reasonable approach.”

Democrats Bobby Singleton of Greensboro; Linda Coleman-Madison of Birmingham; Hank Sanders of Selma and Vivian Davis Figures of Mobile voted for the bill, as did Republicans Tom Whatley of Auburn and Cam Ward of Alabaster, the committee chair. Republicans Clay Scofield of Guntersville; Larry Stutts of Sheffield and Phil Williams of Rainbow City voted against the bill, along with Democrat Rodger Smitherman of Birmingham.

With a few exceptions, Alabama makes possession of marijuana for anything other than personal use a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Possession for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a jail sentence of up to a year and a $6,000 fine. According to the Alabama Sentencing Commission, 265 people went to prison in 2015 for first-degree possession of marijuana, meaning they were sentenced for intent to distribute.

Brewbaker’s bill would tie the punishments to the amount possessed. Possession of more than two ounces of marijuana would be a Class C Felony, while possession of one to two ounces of marijuana would be a Class D felony, with prison time capped at two years and served in a community corrections facility.

Possession of less than an ounce of marijuana would be a violation, subject to a fine and not incarceration. Under the bill, the first two offenses would result in a fine of $250. An offender would face a fine of up to $500 for later violations.

Brewbaker told the committee that easing punishments for marijuana was broadly popular, even among likely Republican voters.

“They don’t want to see with very small amounts, lives ruined by that, and they also said they want the law to be absolute death on those who sell drugs,” he said.

Williams made an attempt to kill the bill in committee and told Brewbaker he would filibuster the legislation if it reached the Senate floor. Williams said he had counseled people suffering from drug addiction and said weakening the penalties would lessen deterrence.

“I never met a single addict who started off with their first toke to become an addict,” he said. “You weaken the penalties further than they are, all we’re saying is ‘You’ll get a slap on the wrist.’ That’s all you get.”

Brewbaker, who also said he had worked in the field, said he found alcohol to be more likely to start people down the road to addiction. A car dealer by trade, Brewbaker said existing laws could make it difficult to hire worthy candidates.

“I employ 109 people,” he said. “I’ve seen a lot of people trying to get jobs that we’ve hung a felony on for something they did when they’re over 18.”

Singleton agreed with Brewbaker. “I’ve never seen a marijuana addict,” he said.

Two legislative committees will take up bills this week that, if approved, could ease punishments for simple possession of marijuana.

The bills, sponsored by Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road, should appear in the House and Senate Judiciary committees Wednesday afternoon. The legislation would, among other items, make possession of less than an ounce of marijuana punishable by a fine, not jail time.

“You don’t want to hang felonies on college kids for simple possession that are going to follow them for the rest of their days,” Brewbaker said.

The bills would not affect laws dealing with posessing or trafficking larger amounts of marijuana. A message seeking comment was left on Monday with Todd.

The success of the bills, like most criminal justice initiatives, hinges on the support or at least the neutrality of the state’s district attorneys. Brewbaker said he was expecting an amendment from the DAs that he said would address the enforcement of simple possession laws.

“We need to find a way to make sure we’re not charging people with intent to distribute unless there’s actual evidence of intent,” Brewbaker said. “That’s one of the criticisms of the law right now. It’s not clear what rises to the level of evidence of intent.”

A message seeking comment was left with Barry Matson, the director of the Office of Prosecution Services, on Monday.

With few exceptions, possession of marijuana in Alabama for anything other than personal use is a Class C Felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Possession of marijuana for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.

The number of people sent to the state's correctional facilities for marijuana possession is relatively small. According to the Alabama Sentencing Commission, about 265 people went to prison in 2015 for possession of marijuana in the first degree. That year, about 24,000 people served time in Alabama correctional facilities.

But Brewbaker said the law would ensure arrests for small amounts of marijuana possession would not follow someone throughout their lives.

""I was in college once myself,"" he said. ""You’re not going to get old heads on young shoulders.""

Todd and Brewbaker’s bills would tie offense levels to amounts. A person would need to have two or more ounces of marijuana to face a Class C felony. For one to two ounces, a person would face a Class D felony. Alabama law caps incarceration for Class D felonies at two years, with any prison time served in a community corrections facility. A Class D felony does not count toward Alabama’s Habitual Offender Law (also known as ‘three strikes you’re out”).

Possession of less than an ounce of marijuana would become a violation, without any jail time. A first or second offense would be subject to a fine of no more than $250. A third or subsequent offense would push the fine up to $500.

The bills specifically exclude edible products and CBD oil, a marijuana derivative with little THC that has shown promise in treating some medical conditions. State law governs the use of CBD oil, the subject of a study at the University of Alabama Birmingham.

Brewbaker, who worked with Rep. Christopher England, D-Tuscaloosa, last years on bills that ended judicial override in death penalty cases, said bipartisan efforts could boost the chances of passage.

“Having Democrats and Republicans pushing the same bill seems to have some effect,” Brewbaker said. “It did on judicial override.”

While speaking before federal, state, and local law enforcement about his plan to stem the flow of illegal drugs moving through the country and address the nationwide opioid crisis, he said he was “astonished” by suggestions that medical marijuana might be a cure. “I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. “And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana—so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful.

A proposed change to Leni’s Law means users of medical marijuana derivative cannabidiol (CBD) oil in Alabama could be allowed to buy oils with more THC in them.

THC and CBD are both cannabis derivatives. THC is the psychoactive component known for giving users a high and is used for pain relief. CBD is nonpsychoactive and is used to treat pain, anxiety, epilepsy and other neurological disorders without the high. Under Leni’s Law, named for a child whose daily seizures are mitigated by CBD usage, CBD oils can't contain more than 3 percent THC ""relative to CBD."" For example if an oil has 10 mg of CBD, it could have no more than 0.3 mg of THC.

Sen. Paul Sanford, R-Huntsville, proposed a rule at Legislative Council on Wednesday that would change the allowed THC level to 3 percent of the total volume. Sanford said that the “percent by volume” change was always the intent of the original bill, but the proposed change also came after hearing from families who said they needed more of the THC component for medical treatment.

“We’re trying to get them to follow the intent of the law to make THC 3 percent of the total volume of the compound instead of 3 percent (relative to) CBD,” Sanford said. “Three percent (relative to CBD) lowers it to a level that makes it not effective for the patients.”

Others in the Legislature agree that the level of THC in medical CBD oil should be raised and none of the lawmakers at the Legislative Council spoke against the proposed rule. The bill’s sponsor Mike Ball, R-Madison, told the Decatur Daily last year that “3 percent is very low; it should probably be 5 percent (relative to CBD).”

And yet the proposed ""percent by volume"" change may have missed the mark, according to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences (DFS) and one of the leading cannabis test labs in Colorado, both of whom feel the increase to be too much.

“That’s a lot of THC,” said Claire Ohman, director of CMT Laboratories in Colorado, which tests all medical marijuana products on the market. “If we go back to the example of the oil and you have the 8.5 oz. bottle and you took 3 percent of that, that’s a tremendous amount of THC.”

Using that example, 3 percent of an 8.5 oz. bottle would be about 7.5 ml. Since the oil is measured in volume (ml) and the THC in mass (mg), the math gets a little sticky, but with THC’s density being close to the density of water, Forensic Sciences estimates an 8.5 oz. bottle of CBD oil could have up to 7,500 mg of THC under the new law.

The recommended dose of THC in Colorado is no more than 10 mg per serving meaning that unless there are at least 750 servings in the bottle, the THC level may be higher than recommended.

“They don’t understand that it will open up the amount of THC in there,” said DFS Director Michael Sparks.

The estimate by DFS doesn’t calculate the amount of THC per serving, an important metric. The rule is also meant to implement a maximum level, not a suggested level, and those who are legally allowed to purchase CBD oil can buy whichever kind they'd prefer.

In addition, Ohman said ingesting too much THC has no adverse health effect. It would just be “unpleasant,” she said.

“Having THC in there is not a bad thing, but this is a tremendous amount of THC we’re talking about. The percent of total volume is a lot,” Ohman said.

The rule is being sent to DFS for recommendation. Ohman said that as more states explore the medical properties of cannabis derivatives such as CBD and THC, states such as Alabama should reach out to states that have already done the research.

“The states that have legalized cannabis have done a tremendous amount of work and have really ironed out a lot of the problems associated with legalization,” Ohman said. “There’s tremendous value in reaching out and talking to people in (a legalized state’s) Legislature as well as in the industry. There’s a lot to be learned, and we can serve as role models or provide a map towards legalization.”

Gov. Phil Murphy is seeking to double the number of locations where New Jerseyans with medical cards can buy marijuana.

Murphy's office announced Monday morning that the state Health Department will take applications to operate six new medical marijuana dispensaries, two each in southern, central and northern New Jersey.

Last month, the Harmony Foundation in Secaucus became the sixth retailer where the more than 25,000 New Jersey residents with medical cards can purchase marijuana.

Still, the expansion of retail locations hasn't kept pace with the number of new medical marijuana users, resulting in lines and occasional supply shortages.

Murphy, a Democrat who also wants to legalize marijuana for non-medical purposes, has pushed changes in the medical program that have brought in 10,000 patients since January — a rate of 100 new people a day. Among other measures, the governor added to the list of conditions for which people can be prescribed marijuana. It now includes anxiety, migraines, Tourette's syndrome and two types of chronic pain.

Murphy has aggressively expanded medical marijuana even as progress toward legal marijuana for any adult 21 and over has stalled. While Murphy and Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, have championed the idea of a legal marijuana marketplace with as many as 218 retailers, they have drawn skepticism and opposition from some fellow Democrats as well as many Republicans.

The medical program has been far less controversial. Murphy's bid to expand it has been greeted favorably by elected officials of both parties, even though his changes have not required votes of the Legislature. Rather, he has ordered Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal to change administrative regulations.

“We look forward to the opening of six new dispensaries so we can ensure that all qualifying patients who want access to medicinal marijuana can have it,’’ Murphy said in a written statement. “Due to the steps that Commissioner Elnahal and I have taken since January, we have seen the addition of 10,000 new patients. Accordingly, we have to expand the number of businesses who are growing product and serving patients.”

Elnahal has spoken to doctors at teaching hospitals in a bid to encourage more of them to prescribe marijuana for conditions such as chronic pain that had been treated with other drugs including opioid painkillers. Although 100 new doctors have signed up to prescribe marijuana since January, only 700 of the state's 28,000 licensed doctors — fewer than 3 percent — are licensed to prescribe marijuana.

Marijuana is legal for medical patients in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Nine states currently allow adults to consume the drug without a medical permit.

Federal authorities this week arrested seven suspected cocaine and marijuana traffickers in an investigation that led to the seizure of $1 million in cash and jewelry.

Five Montgomery men have been charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, a charge that carries a mandatory minimum of 10 years in federal prison, according to a Department of Justice press release.

The man told police he and his wife went to the gas station at North Third Street and West Meighan to buy a marijuana blunt. The man said he asked three men standing outside if they knew where he could buy marijuana. They told him to drive up North Sixth Street. He said he began to drive where they instructed and a vehicle behind him started to flash its headlights. He pulled into a parking lot in the 900 block of North Sixth Street and the three men from the station got out, surrounding his vehicle.

He said two of them put guns to his head inside the vehicle. The one he’d talked to at the station told him “give me your money or I’m going to blow your brains out.”

He gave the man his money and was told to “drive away.” The three men ran east toward North Sixth Place. The victim stayed in his car and called police. He described one of the men as having long dreadlocks. The second had on a “large, strange belt” and a wrap on his head, but not a do-rag. He didn’t get a good look at the third subject, he told police.

His wife confirmed his account of events, and told police that she was not aware of her husband’s intentions to buy marijuana.

Officers drove through the area where the incident occurred, but were not able to locate the suspects."
139,140,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20170511/marijuana-growing-op-found,Marijuana growing op found,"An Altoona man ran from a deputy — leading to misdemeanor charges — and apparently fled to his marijuana growing operation, according to Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin.

That got him a felony charge.

According to a press release from the sheriff's office, Deputy Dakota Hammett was patrolling in the Brown Avenue area of Altoona when he saw Randy Neil Moore, 35, walking in the 3000 block. He tried to speak to Moore, but Moore ran from him and ignored verbal commands to stop. The foot chase went around Moore's residence and ended near the roadway.

While Hammett was retracing his steps to search for lost duty equipment, he discovered multiple marijuana plants outside the residence. Drug Task Force Agent Jeremy Lasseter arrived at the scene where about 200 marijuana plants were found outside and inside the house.

Moore was booked on charges of first-degree possession of marijuana, resisting arrest and attempting to elude.

He was booked into the Etowah County Detention Center on a $25,000 cash bond for possession of marijuana and $1,500 property bond for resisting arrest and attempting to elude.

Moore had been out on bond for drug trafficking and manufacturing a controlled substance."
140,141,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20130103/News/603239940,Three-week probe nets more than 100 pounds of marijuana,"More than 120 pounds of marijuana has been seized in Etowah County during a three-week investigation by the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, and two people are charged with trafficking in the drug.

More than 120 pounds of marijuana has been seized in Etowah County during a three-week investigation by the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, and two people are charged with trafficking in the drug.

The marijuana was imported from Mexico and stacks of small, compacted bales displayed at a news conference Thursday are an example of why the drug should not become legalized, Sheriff Todd Entrekin said.

“Some people think it ought to be legal, but how can you control it?” Entrekin said. “We hope this puts a stop to a lot of the marijuana trafficking in our area.”

The wholesale street value of the marijuana is about $250,000, Rob Savage, commander of the Drug Enforcement Unit, said. The retail street value is slightly higher.

Marijuana still is considered to be a “gateway” drug to drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine, Savage said.

Evidence gathered during the investigation shows the drugs eventually would been in the hands of teens and young adults in Etowah County, he said.

District Attorney Jimmie Harp said drugs like cocaine and meth are more serious, but marijuana typically is the first drug someone uses first, especially teens and young adults.

“This is causing them to fail when they normally would succeed,” he said.

Harp said the two people charged are from the Birmingham area.

“This sends a message that we're not going to accept that and we're going to make sure it doesn't cross our borders and reach our community,” Harp said. “I appreciate the hard work of the DEU.”

Hunter Epps Waters, 22, Trussville, and Hernandez Soto, 36, Birmingham, were arrested in the Gadsden area, about an hour apart. They allegedly had been business partners in the drug trade about a year, Savage said.

Both are charged with trafficking in marijuana. Waters, with a $10,000 bond, had about 45 pounds of marijuana. Soto, with a $50,000 cash bond, had about 50 pounds.

The immigration status of Soto, considered a flight risk, is unknown, Savage said. His bond was set higher, Savage said, because “he is a source, not the middleman.”

The marijuana was in the compacted bales, but in each arrest already was unwrapped and not hidden. In one arrest, it was in a trash bag in the back seat of a truck. In the other, it was in a grocery bags in the trunk, Savage said.

It is believed the bales, with a weight of about 4.5 pounds to 5 pounds, originally were packaged in bulk, tightly wrapped in plastic for concealment, while being brought across the border.

Savage said the investigation originally started in western Etowah County near Boaz with the seizure of about 15 pounds.

However, the investigation is not related to a recent large marijuana bust in Boaz. Information about that part of the investigation will be presented to a grand jury for possible charges.

Gadsden Police Chief John Crane praised the work of the DEU.

“This is a prime example of the professionalism and dedication of the Drug Task Force,” Crane said. “This represents hours of work of sacrifice of the agents.”"
141,142,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20140627/News/603235512,Synthetic drugs pose real threat,"In the late ’90s and early ’00s, methamphetamine became the big enemy on the drug front. It started with “dirty” low-potency meth cooked in kitchens or small labs and morphed into a mass-produced, high-potency product coming from Mexico, with purity that increased from 40 percent to 90 percent.

In the late ’90s and early ’00s, methamphetamine became the big enemy on the drug front. It started with “dirty” low-potency meth cooked in kitchens or small labs and morphed into a mass-produced, high-potency product coming from Mexico, with purity that increased from 40 percent to 90 percent.

Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit Commander Rob Savage said he sees many similarities in the way the synthetic marijuana market is developing now, and expects synthetics to be the big battle in the drug war for this decade.

It’s troubling, because Savage and DEU Sgt. Phil Sims believe people do not understand the dangers of putting these questionable chemical compounds into their bodies.

Like meth, Savage said, synthetic drugs, often called Spice or Clone, but with an ever-changing roster of nicknames, are completely man-made. There are no natural components, and no telling exactly what is in a product from one illicit purchase to the next.

“You could use something one day without serious problems,” Savage said. “And the next time you could get the same product, with the same packaging, and end up in the hospital or the morgue.

“We get the stuff in here and we’re not sure what we’re dealing with,” Savage said. “The person who’s buying it on the street and smoking it certainly doesn’t.”

Just a few years ago, Spice started turning up in convenience stores, with packaging designed to appeal to young adults — something that continues now, Sims said, displaying a seized package of “Geeked Up” that looks quite a bit like SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise. In the early days, people knew to ask for “Scooby snacks” to get the drugs.

Savage said even though packages billed it as an incense or potpourri product, undercover agents found the sellers were not subtle. There would be a display by the checkout with packets of Spice, and below it glass pipes and steel wool.

“Here’s the synthetic and here’s what you use to smoke it,” Savage said.

Even though the packages were marked “not for human consumption” the clerks would often tell buyers how to use the product to get high.

There was a lot of attention paid then to synthetic marijuana and bath salts, with reports of young people ending up in emergency rooms with hallucinations, psychotic episodes and serious physical damage from using them. Savage said there have been people with renal failure and severe lung damage from the drugs.

Sims recalled a case where a man had shut himself off in a room to smoke synthetic marijuana with a 3-month-old baby in the room with him. “The chemicals are in the smoke, too,” Sims said, and that baby was exposed to the harmful effects.

It’s a product that was conceived to be a synthethic — and at that time — legal substance that would mimic the effect of marijuana, Savage said. Instead, it’s more like the effect of using PCP or LSD.

Alabama “got in front” of the problem in a way, with a law that outlaws the base component in synthetic marijuana “and/or analogs” of that component.

Without the addition of the analog language in the law, manufacturers could tweak their chemistry, making minor changes to the compound, and be clear of the law.

Savage said local agents had a case that motivated them to want to curb the trafficking of synthetics.

“There was a young man who hanged himself about three years ago,” he said. “He was found with a bag hanging out of his pocket.”

It contained synthetic drugs the man had bought at a local convenience store.

Savage said the note he left for his parents said he couldn’t take the addiction anymore. “This all happened in about two months time,” he said.

The Alabama law has taken synthetics off the store shelves.

“Now we’re seeing it being imported and sold at the street level like marijuana and cocaine,” Sims said.

Narcotics agent Darron Walker tests substances police believe to be illegal drugs. He said the unit tests a lot of synthetic marijuana Gadsden police find in the course of traffic stops or other arrests.

In the last decade or so, enforcement efforts against meth have made an impact, Savage said. The price of meth in the area has gone from $800 an ounce to $2,300 an ounce, he said, because policing of it has made it harder to find.

But enforcement was only one part of the attack on meth. Education efforts like the Zero Meth campaign that publicized the dangers of using the drug played a role.

Savage said he hopes the DEU can help educate people about the dangers of synthetic marijuana now.

The agents said they don’t know if the tag “synthetic” creates the perception that these substances are not real drugs.

If so, people need to know better.

The penalties for synthetics are the same as for other controlled substances.

“We charge it as unlawful possession or distribution of a controlled substance (synthetic marijuana),” Savage said."

Sara Jane Chittam, 27, of Rainbow City, and Jessica Amber Abner, 29, of Gadsden, are each charged with one count of chemical endangerment of exposing a child to an environment in which controlled substances are ingested, produced or distributed.

Chittam admitted to using heroin and marijuana and tested positive for opiates, marijuana and fentanyl while pregnant.

Abner tested positive for cocaine and admitted to using the illegal drug while pregnant.

Both women are in the Etowah County Detention Center on $10,000 cash bond for the chemical endangerment charges. As a condition of their bonds, they must successfully complete drug treatment programs and will be supervised by the Etowah Court Referral Office upon release.

144,145,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20180417/medical-marijuana-push-spreads-to-utah-oklahoma,"Medical marijuana push spreads to Utah, Oklahoma","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) "" The push for legalized marijuana has moved into Utah and Oklahoma, two of the most conservative states in the country, further underscoring how quickly feelings about marijuana are changing in the United States.

If the two measures pass, Utah and Oklahoma will join 30 other states that have legalized some form of medical marijuana, according to the pro-pot National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws. Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year.

Utah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow use of an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns.

Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, is confident the Utah and Oklahoma measures will pass.

""America's appetite for cannabis is not going away,"" Strekal said. ""We are in the death rattles of prohibition.""

Marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before "" including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.

Mormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the ""Word of Wisdom,"" which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the ""wise counsel"" of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana.

Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana.

Advocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the Mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, Schweich said. His Washington, D.C.-based organization helped draft the measure.

Unlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own except under limited circumstances, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.

""It's a question of compassion,"" Schweich said.

Oklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings.

Ted Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo "" one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use.

Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.

""In 10 years, the church may say something different,"" Lyon said. ""This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'""

Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.

Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.

""I think there's some room for interpretation on this,"" said Frodsham.

The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.

""We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state,"" McOmber said. ""This is an addictive drug.""

145,146,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20120510/News/603236332,Law makes penalties greater for synthetic drugs,"A new law went into effect Thursday that provides greater penalties for crimes related to synthetic marijuana, known as Spice.

A new law went into effect Thursday that provides greater penalties for crimes related to synthetic marijuana, known as Spice.

Mike O'Dell, district attorney for DeKalb and Cherokee counties, said the new law makes it much easier to put a stop to violations related to the drug that has been linked to at least 30 people in DeKalb County being poisoned.

Under the law, synthetic marijuana now carries the same penalties as other illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine. “... It greater expands the ability of law enforcement to push forward more aggressively,” O'Dell said.

The law adds 30 specific chemicals to the list of controlled substances and makes possession of the chemicals a felony in all cases. Some previous cases were misdemeanors.

The new law also creates a Class A felony of trafficking in controlled substance analogs for a person who possesses 28 grams or more of these substances. The minimum sentence is 10 years, and those convicted must serve at least three years and pay a minimum $50,000 fine.

DeKalb County Sheriff Jimmy Harris said he is pleased the bill passed.

“Our hands were tied,” he said. “We would test one of these products and wouldn't be able to do anything about it.”

The synthetic marijuana products already were being removed from stores because of a statewide health warning, but the new law makes the penalties more severe.

“It's no longer legal and it's certainly not harmless, and could potentially be deadly,” O'Dell said.

Spice typically is sold in small, brightly-colored packages that have names like Good Times, Skyscraper, Crazy Monkey, Sexy Monkey and Bedrock Blend with a photo of the cartoon character Fred Flintstone on the front.

Authorities in DeKalb County also are seeing a brownie-like product called a Kush Cake, sealed in brightly-colored packaging, that contains synthetic marijuana, according to Darrell Collins, commander of the county's Drug Task Force.

Collins said he believes the new law will make a difference in stopping some of the problems with Spice.

“We're going to have a zero tolerance,” he said, “just like we've taken with meth.”

A large amount of synthetic marijuana was seized in March at two convenience stores in Gadsden. Thousands of grams of Spice, in small, brightly colored packages, were being sold at the convenience stores. The products appeared to be geared to teenagers and gave a sense that the drug was not bad, Rob Savage, commander of the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, said.

Savage said he is not aware of any reports to law enforcement in Etowah County of any Spice laced with poison. However, the drug has been linked to several suicides across the state.

“The issue around synthetic marijuana is there is very little known about the chemical compounds used to make it,” Savage said.

The first raids on businesses where Spice and the synthetic cocaine-like product called bath salts were being sold were done in February 2011, and merchants were told to stop selling the products.

A state health warning led to the initial raids, but laws later were passed to make synthetic marijuana and bath salts illegal. The law that went into effect on Thursday increases penalties for violations.

Savage said there have been very few issues with Spice in Etowah County since the convenience stores were raided in March.

“We're going to continue to monitor the compliance with the new laws,” he said. “It's important for people to realize Spice and its analogs fall into the same category now as marijuana, methamphetamine or cocaine and it makes everything related to synthetics a felony.”"
146,147,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/bill_would_reduce_alabama_pena.html,Bill would reduce Alabama penalty for marijuana possession,"A bill that would reduce the penalty for marijuana possession in Alabama is scheduled for consideration on Wednesday by both the House and Senate judiciary committees.

Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, are the bill sponsors. Todd has tried with similar bills for several years to reduce the penalties for marijuana possession. She believes opposition has faded and is optimistic the bill will pass.

""I haven't talked to one person who is against it,"" Todd said.

Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, said the bill is intended to keep young people from being saddled with serious criminal records for personal use of pot.

""No one is talking about legalizing possession of marijuana,"" Brewbaker said. ""But I haven't talked to anybody who thinks hanging felonies on college kids is a great idea because that follows them around for the rest of their lives.""

Current law says possession of marijuana for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, which can carry a jail sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $6,000.

A second offense of possession for personal use is a Class D felony. A Class D conviction can carry a sentence of up to five years, but at least part of that time has to be under community supervision. Most Class D offenders are recommended for probation or community corrections, rather than prison.

The Todd and Brewbaker bills add a a lower tier.

Possession of one ounce or less would be a violation -- considered less serious than a misdemeanor -- and would be punishable only by a fine not to exceed $250. That penalty would apply to both a first and a second offense. A third offense would be a violation punishable by a fine of up to $500.

Brewbaker said he's working with the Alabama District Attorneys' Association on some possible changes to the bill.

""If I don't get the DAs' support, the bill is not going to move forward,"" Brewbaker said.

Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said that in practice prosecutors generally seek probation, pretrial diversion, drug court or other alternate penalties for marijuana possession offenders. Ward said that helps make the case for changing the law. But he expects the bill to have opposition and is not sure it will win committee approval.

""People are scared during an election year that they're going to get called soft on crime,"" Ward said. ""If you argue the merits of his bill, it makes sense.""

Todd said the deadly problem of opioid addiction is demanding the attention of law enforcement.

""We need all the resources we have to deal with that and not with a little bit of weed,"" Todd said.

Todd said she believes the time has come for the bill to pass.

""This is not as bad as alcohol,"" Todd said. ""We don't want people to use. But it costs the state a lot of money to enforce the possession law.""

Tuesday will be the 13th day of the legislative session out of a possible 30 days.

Ward said the Senate is expected to consider the General Fund budget on Tuesday.

147,148,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/04/marijuana_in_alabama_debate_st.html,Marijuana in Alabama debate strikes a chord with AL.com readers,"Discussing marijuana in Alabama strikes a deep chord, with supporters enthusiastic about its possible benefits, and opponents worried that a national trend toward legalization might sweep into the state.

Already, the Deep South sees the signs, with medical marijuana recently approved in Arkansas and Florida.

On Feb. 21, AL.com launched a project called ""Marijuana in Alabama"" to assess trends and public sentiment in the state. More than a dozen stories explored issues surrounding changing attitudes and how Alabama handles enforcement of marijuana laws from the courtroom to school hallways.

AL.com found that Alabama courts are not sending many people to prison for marijuana possession anymore, although police are still making arrests and most of the remaining prison inmates are black. As of October 2016, more than 80 percent of the 220 state prisoners convicted of first-degree marijuana possession were black, according to the Alabama Sentencing Commission.

Al.com reported that some counties are still imprisoning new mothers who test positive for marijuana and in some cases removing the baby. We found that some colleges arrest students, some don't. We talked to parents using newly allowed CBD oil to help children with seizure disorder and we spoke with people serving life in prison based on Alabama's low thresholds for felony possession. We found the Baptist lobbying group ALCAP is gearing up to lobby against any legalization movement, employing the same moral arguments used to fight against the rolling back of blue law restrictions on alcohol.

Readers responded with 14,000 comments after the articles and with tens of thousands of shares on social media. We found among Al.com readers that much of the debate focused on whether marijuana was harmful to society or not. Many commenters made the argument that no one has ever died from marijuana. Others argued it leads to drug addiction.

""Anyone ever had a child hooked on pot?"" one reader commented. ""Mine started at age 13, which led to Xanax and Klonopin. So please don't tell me it's harmless. I have seen the effects and how it shaped his mind. Three stints of rehab to get him off all three. I will never support legalizing it.""

Other readers had only ringing endorsements for marijuana.

""Cannabis-hemp is the most useful plant-herb on the planet: food, clothing, shelter, energy, medicine, insights, recreation,"" one reader commented. ""It has been mankind's helpmate and companion since the beginning. Any law against it is a crime against humanity, creation and the Creator.""

Overall, the responses from AL.com readers clearly favored legalization. Here are some results, with numbers in the chart representing percentages.

Across the country, the trend toward softer enforcement continues. Kansas City voted April 4 to lower penalties for people caught with small amounts of marijuana, reducing maximum fines from $500 to $25 and eliminating jail time. Under the old ordinance, judges could send someone to jail for 180 days for marijuana possession.

AL.com readers were also quick to weigh in on poll questions. More than 9,280 readers voted in a poll asking whether recreational marijuana should be legalized: 84 percent said yes.

In another AL.com poll, more than 6,780 voted on the question of whether or not using marijuana was a sin: 88 percent said no and 8 percent said yes. Asked which was more dangerous, alcohol or marijuana, more than 6,470 readers voted: 91 percent said alcohol was more dangerous. Only four percent said marijuana. On the question of whether marijuana was a ""gateway drug,"" 84 percent of readers said no; only 12 percent said yes.

These were not scientific polls, but thousands voted and the results were decidedly one-sided.

Alabama, experts on both sides agree, remains a longshot to legalize marijuana because of its reputation for conservatism and lagging social trends. Yet everyone agrees the idea becomes less farfetched as more states vote to legalize it and as popular opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization.

The state has already taken significant steps with the passage of Leni's Law and Carly's Law.

In 2016, Alabama passed Leni's Law, allowing patients who suffer seizure disorders or other debilitating medical conditions to use a product that comes from the marijuana plant. The law decriminalized cannabidiol, derived from cannabis, for those with certain medical conditions in Alabama. That law expanded on Carly's Law, passed in 2014, that authorized a UAB study on using cannabidiol to treat seizure disorders.

Medical marijuana laws have now been passed in 28 states plus the District of Columbia, including some states in the South: Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana.

Of those 28, eight states also legalized marijuana for recreational use. Oregon, where marijuana is legal for recreational use, recently reported $5 million to $7 million a month in 2016 in tax benefits to the state.

Will Alabama, someday, follow suit?

Many readers expressed that hope.

""Step up, Alabama, don't be last again,"" one reader commented. ""Fire it up and get that tax money!""

Others sounded the alarm.

""Americans can't even deal with alcohol and they want to introduce another intoxicant for which there are no legal guidelines or laws for driving, work situations and other things,"" another reader commented.

A complicating matter for the surge in marijuana legalization is the ascension of former U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions from Alabama to U.S. Attorney General. Sessions is staunchly anti-marijuana, but President Donald Trump has said that enforcing federal anti-marijuana laws in states that have legalized marijuana is not a priority. Still, Sessions issued a memo directing the Justice Department to review its marijuana enforcement policy. That could endanger the Cole Memorandum, a 2013 Obama directive to place a low priority on enforcing federal marijuana laws in states where it has been legalized.

On April 4, the governors of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington wrote a letter to Sessions, urging him to keep marijuana legal in those states where it has been approved.

U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican from California, introduced the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment prohibiting the Justice Department from interfering with the implementation of state medical marijuana use. It became law in 2014 as part of the omnibus spending bill.

""The Rohrabacher amendment prevents Jeff Sessions from spending any federal dollars to enforce federal cannabis prohibition in medically legal states, which includes all fully legal states,"" one AL.com reader wrote. ""Reform of cannabis law is not strictly a liberal agenda item; in fact, it is more rightly a conservative one, since it is an issue of fiscal conservatism, limited and smaller government, and less regulation.""

For marijuana to be legalized in Alabama - either for medical or recreational use - the state Legislature must act.

For now that seems unlikely to happen. An AL.com survey of legislators shows little interest in marijuana legislation.

A bill sponsored by state Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, both this year and last year that would significantly reduce the criminal penalties for possessing one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use, has languished without a committee vote.

As other states begin to reap millions in new revenues from taxing legalized marijuana, Alabama's politicians may become more and more tempted.

""People in Alabama have been smoking pot for over six decades,"" one reader commented. ""Legalize it. Stop arresting people for possessing a harmless substance.""

And others still say not here, not ever.

""I hope Alabama is the last holdout,"" another reader wrote. ""Move to the west coast if you want to smoke it legally."""
148,149,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/nearly_two-thirds_of_americans.html,Nearly two-thirds of Americans say smoking marijuana is 'morally acceptable',"Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that smoking marijuana is ""morally acceptable,"" while 31 percent disapprove of pot on moral grounds, according to a new survey released Monday by Gallup

That's a sharp jump from 2013, when a similarly worded question in a Public Religion Research Institute survey found that slightly fewer than half of Americans said it was morally acceptable to smoke marijuana.

The shift in moral acceptance of marijuana mirrors the shift in support for legalization over that time period, which rose from 48 percent at the end of 2012 to 64 percent last fall, according to Gallup.

On the spectrum of morality, Americans now rate marijuana use similarly to gay and lesbian relations, stem cell research or having a baby outside marriage, according to Gallup. It's seen as significantly more acceptable than medical testing on animals, abortion or pornography. But it's viewed as less acceptable than alcohol use, which 78 percent of respondents say is morally acceptable.

The gap in the acceptance of marijuana and alcohol is driven almost entirely by conservatives, the Gallup data shows. Marijuana and alcohol use are viewed as morally acceptable by large majorities of self-described liberals and moderates - who together comprise about 61 percent of the adult population. Among conservatives, however, 75 percent say drinking is acceptable, while 47 percent say the same of marijuana use.

While marijuana legalization has enjoyed majority support from Democratic voters since at least 2010, many leading Democratic politicians have been slow to embrace the issue. But there are signs that's starting to change: Earlier this year Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a bill in the Senate that would decriminalize marijuana use at the federal level.

The Marijuana Justice Act, another Senate bill that would legalize marijuana nationwide and penalize states that refused to do so, has attracted a number of leading Democrats as co-sponsors, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.).

The next big tests of voters' willingness to change marijuana laws will come in November, when Michigan voters will decide whether to legalize the drug and voters in Utah and Missouri will consider medical marijuana measures."
149,150,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/02/legal_marijuana_is_it_coming_t.html,Legal marijuana: Will Alabama be last?,"As legalized marijuana spreads across the United States, most observers remain skeptical that recreational marijuana will be legal anytime soon in Alabama.

""We're the Bible Belt,"" said Gary Hetzel, a retired warden at Donaldson and Holman prisons and now executive director of the Alabama Therapeutic Education Facility. ""We're too conservative.""

Marijuana activists are hopeful, but realistic.

""It will be legal here when the people force their elected officials to stop enforcing an obviously failed and disastrous policy,"" said Loretta Nall, executive director of Alabamians for Compassionate Care and founder of the U.S. Marijuana Party, which began as the Alabama Marijuana Party. ""Having been an activist here and knowing how difficult it is to motivate enough people to make a difference, I'll say that I don't see that happening any time soon.""

Alabama's reputation for conservatism and lagging social trends make it an unlikely candidate. Yet everyone agrees the idea becomes less farfetched each time another state votes to legalize it and as popular opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization.

""No, I do not think there will be any legalization of marijuana in Alabama,"" said Ralph Hendrix, former program manager for UAB Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities. But he sees the conversation shifting. ""Marijuana is prolific now; it's just a failed strategy and policy,"" he said. ""The tax revenue could be going toward schools. The medical uses are becoming front and center. There is a lot of evidence marijuana helps veterans with PTSD. ""

The University of Alabama at Birmingham has been a focal point for research on medicinal uses of marijuana. As medical research delves into the potential benefits of marijuana for treatment of pain and diseases such as cancer, that could shift the discussion even more.

""I think there's going to be an increasing sympathy,"" said Dr. Bisakha Sen, a professor of healthcare organization and policy at UAB. ""It would first get legalized for medicinal purposes. I would expect that in the next five years. Full legalization could come a few years later.""

Hendrix noted that research at UAB has been the impetus for drafting legislation about cannabis treatments as early as 1982. That came to fruition most recently with Alabama's two cannabinoid oil laws known as Leni's Law and Carly's Law.

In 2016, Alabama passed Leni's Law, allowing patients who suffer seizure disorders or other debilitating medical conditions to use a product that comes from the marijuana plant. The law decriminalized cannabidiol, derived from cannabis, for those with certain medical conditions in Alabama.

That law expanded on Carly's Law, passed in 2014, that authorized a UAB study on using cannabidiol to treat seizure disorders.

Medical marijuana laws have now been passed in 18 states, including some in the Southern region: Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana.

More than half of the 50 states now have laws legalizing marijuana for recreational or medicinal uses.

Since the November election, marijuana has now been legalized for adult recreational use in eight states plus the District of Columbia.

""I think we're headed in that direction,"" said Jonah Tobin, founder of the Alabama Mother Earth Sustainability Alliance, or MESA. ""Half the country now has medical marijuana. I think it's inevitable.""

Opponents see the trend and worry. ""I'm concerned about our children,"" said Susan Short, a children's advocate in South Alabama. ""We don't know even know what the science is of the effects on an unborn baby.""

Many supporters of legalized marijuana worry about the effect new U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will have on drug policy. Sessions, the former U.S. senator from Alabama and longtime opponent of marijuana legalization, could even reverse the trend of marijuana legalization by cracking down on enforcement of federal laws against marijuana in states that have legalized it.

That would also likely squelch talk of legalization in Alabama. ""I don't think there's a chance with Jeff Sessions,"" Hendrix said.

The Drug Enforcement Agency could shut down the legal marijuana trade in other states, although it has become big business in many of those states. ""The DEA still considers marijuana a Schedule A Drug, more dangerous than fentanyl,"" Hendrix said. ""A federal crackdown could be problematic for those 24 states. It's still against the law.""

Marijuana is not a lethal drug in terms of medical effects; legalization could allow focus on fatal addictive drugs, he said.

""The benefit is we could concentrate on the killing drugs,"" Hendrix said. ""The mortality rates are horrible in Alabama because of the opiate epidemic. Marijuana has its disadvantages, like all drugs do. In terms of harm, it's not as harmful as others. The positive far outweighs the negative.""

About 47 percent of all adults age 18 and over have used marijuana, according to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency of the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

""It's everywhere in terms of volume,"" Hendrix said. ""We can't arrest our way out of marijuana.""

Support for legalized marijuana is up to 57 percent, a sign of a dramatic shift in public attitudes over the past decade, according to a survey released in October by Pew Research Center.

That's flipped from a decade ago, when opinion on legalizing marijuana was nearly the reverse - just 32 percent favored legalization, while 60 percent were opposed.

Younger adults are driving the change. About 71 percent of millennials, age 18 to 35, support legalization of marijuana, compared to only 34 percent in 2006, the poll shows.

About 69 percent of police officers say marijuana should be legal for either personal or medical use, according to a Pew Research Center survey of about 8,000 law enforcement officials. About 32 percent said it should be legal for both medical and recreational use; about 37 percent said they favor legalization for medical use only. About 30 percent say marijuana should not be legalized.

Southern Baptists, the largest religious group in Alabama with more than a million members, and other evangelicals have traditionally opposed the legalization of marijuana.

""I don't think they've got the votes to get it in the Legislature,"" said the Rev. Joe Godfrey, former president of the Alabama Baptist Convention and now executive director of the Baptist-affiliated Alabama Citizens Action Program, which lobbies against alcohol, drugs and gambling.

""I'm sure they'll keep pushing until the polls move in their favor. I think what's going to be interesting is to see how Jeff Sessions will handle this. He may crack down on it. In the past he's taken a strong stance against it. That may be what state leaders are waiting for.""

150,151,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/should_we_allow_marijuana_use.html,Should we allow marijuana use in public?,"Despite the fact that recreational marijuana has been legalized in nine states, using marijuana in public is still largely forbidden. Pot advocates say this is a ridiculous provision -- if it's legal to buy, sell and use marijuana, why can't you smoke it in public? But others argue smoking weed in public would normalize it for children, and potheads should stick to lighting up in private. What do you think?

PERSPECTIVES

Marijuana is now legal for recreational use in nine states and Washingon D.C., and it's been decriminalized entirely in an additional 13 states. Marijuana advocates say it's high time weed users be allowed to come out of the shadows and smoke in public.

Not allowing individuals to use pot in public -- while still allowing them to smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol -- adds to the stigma that marijuana is somehow worse for you. If marijuana is legal, it should be treated the same as other legal substances and its users should be allowed to smoke it wherever they please.





But others argue smoking in public of any kind, especially marijuana, is bad for communities. Smoking outdoors can be a health risk to others, and some believe the normalization of marijuana use in public will mean more children will want to smoke it.

Marijuana advocates should focus on pushing for legalization and decriminalization, but pushing for smoking in public, on top of that, is a bridge too far for many. Smoke your weed in private and respect the wishes of others who may not approve of your habit.

By themselves.

Rep. Jim Hill, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee was one. He was joined by Republicans Dickie Drake, Allen Farley, David Faulkner, Mike Holmes and Tim Wadsworth.

They snuffed the thing out like a joint at a Tuscaloosa frat party where the cops were knocking on the door. Easy Peasy.

But nobody killed it more than Rep. Paul Beckman, the Republican from Prattville. He kissed it with death by demanding the bill get a voice vote. It ensured, in that gutless crowd in this election year, it would never make its way out of the committee for a full debate.

So they killed it. And who can blame them?

Lawmakers were busy, trying to make sure Alabama's elementary teachers pack heat. They were busy, doing next to nothing to ease Alabama prison overcrowding.

They had God to invoke. And moralistic pandering to perform. Forget pot. Just be glad they didn't ban dancing.

Keep in mind we're not talking about legalization, but a bill that would punish those who have less than an ounce of pot with fines instead of jail time. It made sense in a state known for mass producing criminals and stockpiling them in overcrowded prisons that it can't pay for and can't keep safe.

Rep. Patricia Todd, a Democrat from Birmingham who is not seeking another term, brought it to the House. And Dick Brewbaker, a Republican from Montgomery who is also not seeking re-election, brought it to the Senate, which passed out of committee by a 6-4 vote Wednesday.

Brewbaker argued that too many potential workers are driven from jobs because they are stuck, as young people, with criminal records that follow them too long.

""Nobody in here wants to hang felonies or drug conviction misdemeanors on a bunch of college kids,"" he said. ""We're arresting more people for marijuana than opioids.""

But it didn't make any difference.

In the end the politics of piety won in a committee. Keep putting people away, because it's the Alabama way.

Brewbaker insists there's bipartisan support for such a bill, and ""It's going to happen, just a matter of when.""

Just not now.

It's no surprise that the bill died, I guess. What was unusual was how Brewbaker broke news of its death.

He tweeted it Wednesday. Like this:

""Marijuana reform is probably dead. House bill failed in House judiciary. All that work, up in smoke.""

Marijuana reform is probably dead. House bill failed in House judiciary. All that work, up in smoke. -- Dick Brewbaker (@dick_brewbaker) February 21, 2018

A little humor. A little melancholy.

What came after, though, was rare. Democrats and Republicans tweeted appreciation for Brewbaker. Not because of dope. Not because they agree with him all the time, but because they saw in him a thing that's rare in Montgomery: Reason.

As one tweeter wrote: ""This is going to sound crazy coming from a registered Democrat, who doesn't always agree with you...but we need you to stay in the legislature...we have to pass common sense laws to move this state towards progress.""

Brewbaker replied with one of the most honest assessments I've seen from a sitting politician.

""I appreciate that, but being in the legislature is bad for people (at least me) spiritually. No one can swim around in that sea of flattery forever and not have it affect them. It's time for me to go. Redemption isn't found in politics.""

Maybe it's easy to say those things when you no longer need a vote. But it is truth seldom told by politicians, about politics.

I don't think Brewbaker has to worry so much about redemption. In many ways, he has found it.

152,153,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/fix_the_marijuana_mess_by_lett.html,Fix the marijuana mess by allowing states to sort it out,"Congress simply can't ignore the massive collision about to occur between federal and state laws regarding marijuana. The Obama administration essentially created new federal marijuana policy by refusing to enforce unambiguous federal law. Whether it was a prudent decision or not, Americans in states from Alabama to California relied on that enforcement decision.

With Attorney General Jeff Sessions poised to more-fully prosecute federal marijuana laws again, Congress has the option of either allowing many Americans to face serious criminal penalties or actually addressing an issue that isn't going away.

It's time for Congress to deschedule marijuana and let states sort it out.

No, I'm not calling for uniform legalization of marijuana. I do, however, realize the absurdity of placing Americans in massive criminal jeopardy for conduct their state government approves.

As a Schedule I narcotic under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), marijuana falls in the most restrictive category. To put this in context, cocaine and opioids are Schedule II. Drugs like Xanax and Valium are all the way down in Schedule IV.

While it's pretty clear that marijuana probably shouldn't be treated the same as heroin, methamphetamines, or LSD, this isn't a matter of reclassifying marijuana under the CSA. We don't need an additional layer of federal criminal law at all. States are perfectly up to the task of handling marijuana. More importantly, the risk is relatively nominal. Even the Drug Enforcement Agency's own fact sheet notes, ""No death from overdose of marijuana has been reported.""

States are increasingly capable of regulating marijuana and its derivatives with a wide range of policy responses. A handful of states permit recreational marijuana. 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have extensive public medical marijuana and cannabis programs. 17 states allow use of cannabidiol (CBD) for medical reasons.

American government relies heavily on our states operating as laboratories of democracy. That's an amazing feature of our republic. We permit social and economic policy experiments without risking the whole country.

We ought to allow our federalist system of government to work as designed--that means allowing states to enact different policies in response to the same underlying issue. Instead, we're holding on to a crusty ""big government"" paradigm for marijuana that imposes immense criminal liability.

As California permits recreational marijuana use, we should watch the state's experience and see how it goes. If Reefer Madness consumes the state, then we probably shouldn't follow their lead.

Descheduling marijuana shifts the locus of regulation; it doesn't force states to legalize anything they'd rather not. It leaves the debate over the right policy to state governments better equipped to respond to the tailored concerns of residents.

Congress has a clear opportunity to respect varying policies on marijuana across the nation and avoid needlessly putting Americans in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors. If politicians really believe federalism is more important than one-size-fits-all edicts from Washington, here's a perfect opportunity to show it.

153,154,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/05/_not_ready_for_that_how_alabam.html,'Not ready for that': How Alabama Republicans thwarted marijuana decriminalization,"Nine states and Washington, D.C., allow for the recreational use of marijuana. Another 22 states have decriminalized the drug, and public opinion suggests legalization is supported by more than 60 percent of Americans.

But in the halls of the Statehouse in Montgomery, conservative lawmakers pushed back this past session against efforts to ease up on the tokers.

Their concerns varied. Ultimately, two bills to decriminalize marijuana possession never made it to either the House or Senate floors for debate.

Standing atop the anti-marijuana barricade was the House Judiciary Committee, where the Republican majority defeated the only decriminalization action to come before them.

Rep. Mike Holmes, R-Wetumpka, was one of the ""No"" votes. He said his constituents simply ""were not ready for that.""

'Major obstacle'

Future attempts at decriminalization - let alone a full-out legalization effort - are in flux. The two sponsors of the bills introduced this spring rolling back pot penalties aren't seeking re-election: Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham; and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road.

""We feel sure someone will pick up where we left off and move it forward,"" said Todd, who has tried for years to lessen the penalties. ""We don't know who that will be.""

Said Brewbaker: ""There is clear bipartisan support to have a serious look at our marijuana statues.""

Brewbaker's SB251, which was nearly identical to Todd's HB272, managed to survive committee scrutiny. The Senate Judiciary Committee, with a 6-4 vote on Feb. 21, endorsed it.

But the bill did not go any further. The House Judiciary Committee, on the same day, shot down Todd's HB272 with a 7-5 decision. All seven ""No"" votes were Republican. Rep. Mike Ball of Madison was the only Republican to vote in favor of Todd's measure.

To borrow a Cheech & Chong motive title, Brewbaker's Senate bill also went ""Up in Smoke.""

""There was no reason to move it out when the House Judiciary Committee made (their vote) clear,"" said Brewbaker.

Under Alabama law, someone who possesses any amount of marijuana for personal use is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine. Those who have been convicted before of possessing marijuana face a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.

The two failed bills tied the offense levels to the amount of marijuana:

Possession of 1 ounce or less of marijuana would be punishable only by a fine and would be reclassified as a violation instead of a misdemeanor. That would apply to both first and second offenses.

Third and subsequent offenses would still be labeled a violation, punishable by a fine up to $500. No jail time nor misdemeanor charge would be rendered.

Possession of 1-2 ounces of marijuana would have been a Class D felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. But the Class D felony could not count under the Habitual Felony Offender Act, which can put an inmate behind bars for life. Crimes such as possession of marijuana, controlled substances, theft of property, and possession of or fraudulent use of a credit or debit card are crimes considered Class D felonies.

Possession of more than 2 ounces of marijuana would be a Class C felony.

Brewbaker defended his bill as something that made sense but confronted political obstacles during an election year.

""I'm not talking about legalization, but if you get caught with less than an ounce of marijuana, the state and taxpayers are better served by imposing a heavy fine than they are with jail time,"" he said.

He added, ""It doesn't seem to make much sense to me to hang Class C misdemeanors and felonies that will hang around these people throughout their lives.""

Brewbaker also pitched SB51, which would have raised the amount of marijuana that would label someone as a drug trafficker, soon to receive a mandatory prison sentence.

Presently, that level is 1 kilo - 2.2 pounds. Under SB25, it would be 10 pounds, the same as in other states, such as South Carolina, Brewbaker said.

""If they find two full grown marijuana plants in your back yard and the combined weight is over 2.2 pounds, you can be charged with trafficking even if there is no evidence you are trafficking,"" Brewbaker said. ""It's a mandatory three years in prison.""

Rep. Paul Beckman, R-Prattville, and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Todd's bill went further than Brewbaker's. He said he wished that Brewbaker had kept trying to move SB25 forward.

""A lot of these offenders are not drug pushers and the bottom line is we don't want to ruin someone's life,"" said Beckman, who said Brewbaker's decision to pull SB51 from consideration was ""premature.""

""That was Dick's call,"" he said. ""As far as Todd's bill, basically, what it would do is legalize marijuana.""

Brewbaker said, however, ""I didn't see a whole lot of point to it. That committee is dead set on keeping things the way they are.""

Said Todd, regarding her decriminalization push: ""I think that many of the members are supportive of it. But they are afraid their constituents will think they are soft on crime, somehow. I think that is a major obstacle.""

'Against decriminalization'

None of the states that allow for the recreational use of marijuana are in the South.

Few southern states have decriminalized the drug as well, though a rash of cities have pushed to roll back penalties. In Jackson, Mississippi, city officials voted unanimously in February to effectively limit the maximum penalty of 1 ounce or less of marijuana to a $100 fine.

Atlanta approved a similar measure last October. In Nashville, government officials moved forward in 2016 with an ordinance that reduces the penalty for people who are found possessing a half-ounce of marijuana or less to a $50 fine or 10 hours of community service.

In New Orleans, city officials urged police to spend less time arresting people on simple marijuana possession. Arrests have plummeted: From June 2016 to March 2017, only 1 percent of encounters between police and someone accused of possessing marijuana resulted in an arrest; in 2014, the rate was 72 percent.

And the Big Easy hosted, for the first time this past week, a three-day marijuana conference.

Alabama city leaders have pushed to have marijuana penalties relaxed, such as in Tuscaloosa where city leaders urged state lawmakers in December to roll back pot penalties over concerns about jail overcrowding.

Alabama cities, unlike municipal governments in most other states, do not have home rule powers and cannot make changes without the Legislature's approval.

Alabama is also among the deepest of the red states, and home to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is leading the anti-pot movement from the federal level.

Sessions, in January, rescinded guidelines from the Obama administration that allows states to legalize marijuana with minimal interference from federal authorities. Sessions has also raise health and safety concerns about marijuana, claiming that marijuana leads to heroin use.

Alabama also has among the highest concentration of Christians who identify as evangelical Protestants, a segment that opposes legalizing marijuana, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.

Among white evangelicals, 60 percent believe marijuana should remain illegal, while only 38 percent back legalization. By contrast, those labeled as ""unaffiliated"" to a religious identity support legalization by a 78-20 percent difference.

The polling also shows a partisan split. Democrats overwhelmingly support legalization, by a 69-28 percent margin. Republicans, who dominate the elected offices in Alabama, oppose it by 55-43 percent.

""I get feedback from all 45,000 of my constituents and they are against decriminalization,"" said Representative Holmes, whose legislative district includes Autauga and Elmore counties - two conservative bastions that overwhelmingly backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and supported Republican Roy Moore in last year's special Senate contest.

'Quantify amount'

Rep. Jim Hill, R-Moody, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said his decision to vote against the lightening the marijuana law had more to do with a lack of scientific testing for people who are caught by police driving while impaired after smoking marijuana.

Moody, a former judge, said there are no tests, such as Breathalyzers, that can determine whether someone is impaired from marijuana.

Police, for instance, can determine someone's blood-alcohol content almost immediately after pulling him or her over for suspicion of DUI. Marijuana use is determined through blood tests, and those tests are not often readily available, requiring police to make judgement calls.

""I have an issue with allowing a substance in your body that we know impairs you and affects the ability to operate a vehicle,"" Hill said. ""We cannot quantify that amount.""

Recent national news reports have showcased the concerns about impaired driving in states where recreational use of marijuana is legal.

NBC Nightly News, this past week, interviewed a Denver police sergeant who told host Lester Holt that authorities are seeing ""more people driving high on marijuana."" Colorado was among the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana in 2012.

""It can be a little difficult trying to prove someone is driving high and impaired by marijuana,"" Sgt. Rick Coisman told Holt. ""Alcohol is scientific and validated and accepted by the courts. Marijuana, we're just not there yet.""

A Colorado Department of Transportation survey showed that 70 percent of marijuana users admitted to driving under the influence of the drug at least once during the past year. More than a quarter of those, the survey shows, are driving high daily.

The Montgomery-based Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, in its research backing decriminalization, cited a National Highway Transportation Administration study and analysis from academic researchers that found, unlike alcohol, there is no clear correlation between specific blood levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the principle psychoactive element in marijuana - and impairment.

The group also cited a study from the American Journal of Public Health that found no increase in vehicle crash fatalities in either Colorado or Washington, relative to similar states, after they legalized marijuana.

Hill, though, said he is concerned about DUI instances increasing from marijuana decriminalization, leaving law enforcement without a solution to screen impaired drivers.

Brewbaker disagrees with Hill's assessment. He said police already have the authority to remove someone who they believe is driving impaired.

""A cop has to have some reason to pull someone over if they are acting irrationally or are falling asleep at the wheel, there are all sorts of ways,"" he said. ""You don't have to know what is causing the impairment.""

'Heavy lift'

Brewbaker and Todd said that Alabama is spending too much time and money on arresting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana at the same time opioid use is fast becoming a top killer.

Said Todd: ""It's about the amount of resources the state has to pay out on marijuana possession especially small amounts. It takes a police officer's time, and it takes the court's time. We all realize we need to divert those resources to the opioid epidemic.""

Indeed, an analysis by Alabama Appleseed shows that more Alabamians were arrested for marijuana possession in 2016 than for opioids, cocaine, and synthetic narcotics.

The group also showed that Alabama spent $13.3 million on the enforcement of marijuana laws in 2010, that enforcement disproportionately affects blacks who are 4.5 times more likely to be arrested for possession than whites, and that the state's laws lack clarity between marijuana possession and distribution.

Appleseed contends that two people arrested for possessing the same amount of marijuana in Alabama can face different punishments based on the ""subjective decision"" of a government official.

Frank Knaack, executive director with Appleseed, said the marijuana possession laws are an ""example of the kind of systematic racial disparity"" that exists in Alabama's criminal justice system.

""Marijuana possession in Alabama for the first offense is a misdemeanor, but the second offense is a felony,"" Knaack said. ""You can have a little amount, if arrested, and that can bring along a felony.""

Hill, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, said there is little evidence to suggest that simple marijuana possession arrests are crowding Alabama's state prisons. A proponent of drug courts and intervention programs, Hill said most inmates are in prison because of a violent offense and ""not because they were smoking marijuana.""

Jennifer Kenney, assistant professor at the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Alabama, said she doesn't believe if Alabama decriminalized low amounts of marijuana possession, there will be a ""huge drop"" in the state's overcrowded prisons.

Kenney, though, believes that Alabama should legalize marijuana possession to help provide medical support for people struggling with crippling opioid addictions.

She said by taxing marijuana, revenues can be used to help fund programs aimed at getting people help with other drug addictions.

""It could potentially help the state of Alabama and our budgets if used in a way to actually increase the health of everyone,"" she said. ""People don't understand that marijuana can really help people fight pain.""

But, she added, ""We are home to Jeff Sessions. He has said time and again, he doesn't see the difference between marijuana and heroin and controlled substance. I think (legalization) is a heavy lift for a place like Alabama."""
154,155,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/bill_to_reduce_alabama_penalty.html,Bill to reduce Alabama penalty for marijuana possession hits snag,"A move to reduce the penalty for possession of marijuana met resistance today in the Alabama Legislature.

The House Judiciary Committee voted 7-5 against a bill by Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, who has tried for years to lessen the penalty.

Todd's bill provides that possession of an an ounce or less would be punishable only by a fine of up to $250. The offense would be a violation, which is less than a misdemeanor. That would apply to both the first and second offense.

Third and subsequent offenses would still be a violation, punishable by a fine of up to $500.

Rep. Jim Hill, R-Moody, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he thought the bill went too far in that possession would be only a violation even after repeat offenses.

""I think we're probably headed toward either some type of either decriminalization or lesser emphasis being placed on marijuana,"" Hill said. ""But it's illegal. And to say that no matter how many times you use it, how many times it's personal use, it never rises to the level of a misdemeanor, I just think that's a mistake.""

Under current law, possession for personal use is a misdemeanor on the first offense and a low-level felony on the second offense.

""I'm sad,"" Todd told the Associated Press. ""But it's an election year. And a lot of people who voted no told me to my face that they were going to vote yes. And I think the roll-call vote scared a lot of people (who) don't want to look like they're soft on drugs. But most people sitting there have no concept or understanding of marijuana.""

A bill nearly identical to Todd's did advance today in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which approved it on 6-4 vote. That bill, by Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, moves to the Senate floor. But it would have to also pass the House to become law.

""Nobody in here wants to hang felonies or drug conviction misdemeanors on a bunch of college kids,"" Brewbaker said. ""We're arresting more people for marijuana than opioids.""

Sen. Phil Williams, R-Rainbow City, told Brewbaker he would probably filibuster against the bill if it came to the Senate floor. Williams said he has worked as a counselor for people with addictions and said many started out on marijuana.

Brewbaker said he believed alcohol was more likely to lead to the use of harder drugs that marijuana.

Voting against Todd's bill in the House Judiciary Committee were Hill, and Reps. Paul Beckman, R-Prattville; Dickie Drake, R-Leeds; Allen Farley, R-McCalla; David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook; Mike Holmes, R-Wetumpka and Tim Wadsworth, R-Arley.

Voting for Todd's bill were Reps. Marcel Black, D-Tuscumbia; Mike Ball, R-Madison; Prince Chestnut, D-Selma; Merika Coleman, D-Birmingham and Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa.

Voting for Brewbaker's bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee were Sens. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham; Vivian Figures, D-Mobile; Hank Sanders, D-Selma; Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro; Tom Whatley, R-Auburn and Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, the committee chairman.

Voting against Brewbaker's bill were Sens. Clay Scofield, R-Guntersville; Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham; Larry Stutts, R-Sheffield and Williams.

This is, of course, a relative increase, and shouldn’t be confused with the overall percentage chance of getting in an accident, which is much smaller.

Regardless, driving while impaired is a terrible idea. Although we have good tests to determine if people are under the influence of alcohol, no such tests are currently available for marijuana, making enforcement more difficult.

Pregnancy effects

Babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight, delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a 2016 systematic review. But there were no links seen for changes in birth length, head circumference or congenital malformations. There’s limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers, and there’s not enough evidence to comment on much else about babies and their outcomes.

Memory and concentration

There’s moderate evidence, from many studies, that learning, memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use. There’s limited evidence, however, that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement, employment, income or social functioning, or that these effects linger after the pot has “worn off.”

Mental health

The possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated. The most recent meta-analysis found that there’s a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis, specifically schizophrenia. This mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high-quality studies. Another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use and the development of bipolar disorder. Heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts.

What makes this complicated is that it’s hard to establish the arrow of causality. Are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems? Or are people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot?

There’s a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances. Some see marijuana as a “gateway” drug, leading to other substance use or abuse. Others see this as only a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well."
157,158,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/opinion/marijuana-opiates-jeff-sessions.html,Opinion | Marijuana Can Save Lives,"There is also intriguing preliminary evidence that cannabidiol, a major component of marijuana, can blunt craving in individuals with opioid dependence following a period of abstinence.

If cannabis were actually a dangerous gateway drug, as the attorney general suggested, it would be very easy to see in the data. We would find that medical-marijuana laws increased opiate drug use and overdose deaths, when in fact just the opposite has happened.

We would also expect to see a consistent sequence of drug abuse from cannabis to, say, opiates or cocaine, across different cultures. But this is not the case at all.

For example, in Japan, where marijuana use is relatively rare, 83 percent of people who used recreational drugs did not begin with cannabis. This was true as well for 60 percent of South Africans.

A more plausible explanation for the common finding that people use a series of recreational drugs is a general propensity for risk-taking behavior, of which drug use is just one manifestation.

None of this is to say that marijuana is without risks. It certainly isn’t. Cannabis can impair cognition, attention and intellectual performance, though the effects are reversible. And in some individuals who are genetically at risk, it can unleash psychotic states. But there is little evidence that marijuana use increases mortality.

In contrast, opiate overdose is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing about 91 Americans every day. President Trump has rightly called the opioid crisis a “public-health emergency” but has yet to articulate a real policy or allocate the necessary resources to deal with it.

At the very least, let’s not spend precious resources on a senseless cannabis crackdown — especially when the evidence suggests that it would only worsen the opioid scourge and cost more American lives."

Langone/Bellevue Medical Center and lead author of the new paper, published in Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology.

Others questioned the one-in-three figure, however. Paul Armentano, the deputy director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), said that even with more widespread use of marijuana, “this phenomenon is comparatively rare and seldom is reported” and strikes only “a small percentage of people.”

And several physicians who routinely prescribe medicinal marijuana for conditions ranging from chronic pain to epilepsy said they have not seen the cyclic vomiting syndrome in their patients, but noted that they typically prescribe compounds that are not designed to produce a high and contain very low amounts of the psychoactive ingredient THC.

Dr. Habboushe said doctors in other parts of the country may be unfamiliar with C.H.S. or mistake it for a psychiatric or anxiety related syndrome. And even if they are aware of it, many regard it as a “rare, kind of funny disease,” replete with anecdotes of patients who spend hours in the shower.

But the condition can be quite serious. One 33-year-old military veteran who asked not to be identified by name described bouts lasting up to 12 hours in which he felt “like a puffer fish with sharp spikes was inflating and driving spikes into my spine from both sides. I’ve broken bones, and this blew it out of the water.”

“I know patients who have lost their jobs, gone bankrupt from repeatedly seeking medical care, and have been misdiagnosed for years,” Dr. Habboushe said.

“Marijuana is probably safer than a lot of other things out there, but the discussion about it has been so politicized and the focus has been on the potential benefits, without looking rigorously at what the potential downside might be,” he said. “No medication is free from side effects.”"
159,160,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/nyregion/new-york-today-marijuana-history.html,New York Today: A Cultural History of Marijuana,"Good morning on this brightening Monday.

Will New York be the next state to legalize marijuana? Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s 2018 budget plan calls for a study of the pros and cons.

If legal weed comes to New York City, it would finally achieve legitimacy in a place with a long, mixed record of tolerance and crackdowns. Here’s a quick spin through the cultural history of pot here.

• In the 1930s, as authorities nationwide waged war on “reefer madness,” a doctor at the Manhattan Detention Complex urged treatment, not incarceration, for the city’s marijuana “addicts,” including jazz musicians who “find it necessary to take it before playing.”

• Pot moved out of jazz clubs and marginalized communities and into mainstream (read: white) culture with the help of the Beat authors. Jack Kerouac, according to his first wife, took his first hit from the saxophonist Lester Young at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem in the early 1940s."

A 2017 survey in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport found only 15 published studies that investigated the effects of cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient, THC, on exercise performance. “It is generally considered that THC won’t improve aerobic performance and strength, and my review confirms that impression,” said Dr. Michael C. Kennedy, a cardiologist, clinical pharmacologist and associate professor at the University of New South Wales and St. Vincent’s Hospital Medical School, who conducted the review.

He doubts claims that it helps with recovery and improves concentration, and says that athletes who tout its athletic virtues are just promoting cannabis use. “It will not make you faster, it may slow you down and certainly should not be used if there is any possibility of heart disease,” Dr. Kennedy said. Indeed, some studies have linked marijuana to hypertension and other heart risks.

But Dr. Bonn-Miller believes that from a physiological standpoint, the relationship between marijuana use and running makes some sense. “There’s a lot of overlap in terms of the pathways that are activated between what’s known as a runner’s high and the high that comes from THC,” he said. “Both of those involve activation of the endocannabinoid system, so it’s not too surprising that THC might be used to enhance the runner’s high that’s gained from endurance exercise.”

Runners also report using products with cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana that has shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, for recovery. The CBD is usually applied through an oil. “It lowers the amount of many, many pro-inflammatory cytokines — things that our body makes naturally in response to any inflammation response,” said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Health, who is studying the use of CBD to treat epilepsy. He said that CBD has also been shown to bind to serotonin receptors, “which may be related to its effect as an anti-anxiety agent.”

Scott Dunlap, a 48-year-old ultrarunner who calls himself a semiprofessional (he has sponsors but also a day job) and who once ran a race in a marijuana leaf costume, says he will use an edible or vape marijuana after a long race. (He tried it once during a run and said he wound up “lost and hungry.”) He doesn’t see using marijuana after running a race as all that different from drinking a beer — except that a lot of races provide beer free.

The 420 Games, which has events in California, Colorado and Pennsylvania, gives out samples — sometimes marijuana, but more often oils and creams containing CBD — in places where they are legal, though the sponsors say they are not intended to be used at the event.

“I can honestly say it’s one of my favorite events of all time,” said Mr. Collins, the ultrarunner, who previously served as a spokesman for the event."

Yet it’s worth noting that the city doesn’t seem to have gotten much smellier in the new year, after the recreational use of marijuana became legal in California under a law approved by voters in 2016.

Well, obviously: because nobody smokes marijuana anymore. Everyone’s vaping it. Or eating, drinking, sipping, dabbing, sucking on lozenges, chewing on gum, applying unguents or administering a drop or two of a cannabis-infused tincture under one’s tongue, where it is absorbed into the sublingual artery, within minutes producing an invisible, odorless, private high.

These are a few of the inventions of an increasingly sophisticated set of marijuana start-ups, which argue that by pushing the industry past smoke, they can make cannabis convenient and ubiquitous — the drug of the future, and the next great American bonanza.

Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and it is legal for medicinal use in 29 states. The drug remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has signaled a crackdown on the business. Yet growth of the legal marijuana industry keeps beating even its biggest boosters’ expectations; customers in North America will spend more than $10 billion on legal marijuana in 2018 and nearly $23 billion by 2021, projects the ArcView Group, a cannabis-focused research and investment firm."

Those who argue against expunging criminal records say people who violated the law should live with the consequences, regardless of subsequent legal changes.

“In all the other states, the process has been messy,” said Robert Mikos, a professor at Vanderbilt University who studies marijuana law and policy. “But whether people agree with what they did or not, California at least addressed it and there’s value in that.”

Even in California, there is significant variation in how counties are handling misdemeanor marijuana convictions. Some, like Fresno County, are dealing with them on a case-by-case basis, said Steve E. Wright, the county’s assistant district attorney. Jeff Rosen, district attorney of Santa Clara County, said he was working with the local public defender’s office to identify cases. And prosecutors in San Francisco and San Diego have been more proactive, with both cities planning to automatically dismiss misdemeanor convictions and to reduce felony convictions to misdemeanors.

In San Francisco, Mr. Gascón said he wanted to avoid putting people through a process that he said violates the spirit of legalization.

“A lot of people don’t even know they qualify, and I don’t think it’s the right thing to do to make people pay lawyers’ fees and jump through a bunch of hoops to get something they should be getting anyway,” he said.

In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which allowed adults 21 and older to buy or possess 28.5 grams of marijuana — about one ounce — or grow up to six plants at a private residence."

That her oldest daughter began to worry that she was getting a contact high while she was doing her homework made me despair for a generation and suggested that perhaps a certain unwarranted hysteria had taken hold. Then one night, at a moment of extreme fragrancy, my neighbor texted and asked me to come over and take a sniff for myself, and it seemed as if I had walked into a commune in the Redwoods sometime between the Tet offensive and the presidency of Gerald Ford.

The situation was especially curious, because no one in my household smoked anything; there was no apartment on the other side and the one directly below was undergoing a renovation and remained empty. My neighbor wondered whether the couple above her on the top floor, friends, were the ones indulging. But they were Holocaust survivors in their 90s. Who was going to tell them to switch to sherry?

As it happened, the smell was coming from the apartment two floors down, in the line. Middle-aged lawyers were doing the inhaling, and we asked them if they could devise a way, perhaps through better filtering or ventilation, to mitigate the problem. In retrospect this was naïve because so much of the pot commonly smoked today is pungent enough to resist efforts to conceal it. Even when this couple volunteered to stop smoking in their apartment, taking the habit outside instead, the mere fact of the pot lying around the house caused the smell to migrate upward in the building. Eventually they committed to keeping their pot tightly wrapped in the freezer to contain the odor. On several occasions I noticed that after one of them had smoked outside and returned, the elevator in the building retained the fierce smell for a while after.

This was only to be expected. A friend in a brownstone nearby told me that the smell of pot smoke often traveled into her house through the walls, from the building next door. This might also seem inconceivable until you start reading online reviews of various popular strains, one of which is called Wonder Woman and is described as having “a mostly skunky smell with notes of fruit and jet fuel.”"

Nassau and Suffolk law-enforcement officials said they intend to keep arresting low-level marijuana offenders even though the city is backing off because of a wide racial gap in arrests.

The counties will change direction only if Albany changes the law to address the disproportional impact on minorities. Like the city, Long Island’s arrest rates for marijuana possession are far higher for African-Americans and Hispanics, records show.

For Nassau and Suffolk police commissioners, the decision to stand firm on making marijuana arrests is clear-cut: It’s their job.

“The law in place is the law we enforce,” Nassau’s Patrick Ryder said in a statement.

“The Suffolk County Police Department is responsible for enforcing all laws on the books and will continue to carry out that responsibility by arresting people who violate the law,” Commissioner Geraldine Hart said.

Practicality is also a consideration for the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office, which works with a patchwork of law enforcement agencies.

“Unlike New York City, Nassau has not only our countywide police department, but also many municipal departments and, absent legislative direction, uniform policymaking is challenging,” said spokesman Brendan Brosh.

Suffolk District Attorney Timothy Sini didn’t return requests for comment.

Last week, the Manhattan and Brooklyn district attorneys said they would stop prosecuting possession and smoking violations in the interest of fairness.

“The dual mission of the Manhattan DA’s office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.”

The policy pivot reflects New York City’s growing awareness of racial disparity in marijuana arrests: African-Americans and Hispanics accounted for 86 percent of the arrests for marijuana possession, records show.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday he will take steps to prepare for the “likely” legalization of recreational marijuana in the city. He will order the NYPD, which is currently holding a 30-day working group looking at its marijuana policing methods, to stop arresting New Yorkers who smoke pot in public and to instead issue summonses.

On Long Island, arrest rates for marijuana possession are four times higher for minorities than for whites — five arrests for 10,000 whites and 20 arrests for 10,000 nonwhites, records show.

The District of Columbia and nine states, including Massachusetts and Vermont in the Northeast, have already legalized recreational marijuana use and the movement is gaining momentum in New York.

About a month ago, Democrat Cynthia Nixon made marijuana legalization the top policy priority in her bid to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. She cited the racial disparity in prosecutions.

After Nixon’s announcement, Cuomo said his administration would produce a study on legalization this month. The governor previously called marijuana a “gateway” drug and opposed legalization, but since has softened his stance.

Several lawmakers in Albany support a bill stuck in committee and some rank-and-file Democrats are calling for the state party to adopt a pro-legalization stance at its convention Wednesday and Thursday in Uniondale.

To Garden City defense attorney Steve Epstein, the county-by-county approach to enforcement is deeply flawed.

“It’s unfair to have two sets of rules — one for New York City and another for Long Island,” Epstein said. “We need statewide policy.”

Relaxed enforcement has the support of Jeffrey Reynolds, an addiction expert and president of the Mineola-based Family and Children’s Association.

Reynolds would like to see any savings from fewer marijuana arrests poured into drug education and prevention programs.

“We need a comprehensive approach where we address the public health risks of marijuana without arresting people for holding a dime bag,” Reynolds said.

Melissa Moore of the Drug Policy Alliance welcomes New York City’s enforcement retreat but called it a “bandage on a gaping hole” that fails to permanently remedy racial disparities in low-level drug arrests.

Even misdemeanor arrests for marijuana possession can keep young people from getting jobs or housing. A conviction could lead to the revocation of a student loan or could be considered a violation of immigration status, said Moore, the alliance’s deputy state director.

“This is a systematic issue which requires a systematic solution,” she said.

177,178,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/marijuana-pot-arrests-long-island-1.18664606,Stop making arrests for pot use,"Under New York State law, possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana in a public place is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by 3 months in jail. Public opinion in New York, though, is increasingly leaning toward legalizing possession, as well as the sale of marijuana for recreational use.

The trend appears inevitable, but if we don’t want the time in transition to be utterly chaotic, jurisdictions should come to a common understanding on how to enforce the existing laws while the debate about changing them takes place.

New York’s legalization of medical marijuana in 2014 went off without a hitch. A recent Quinnipiac poll found New Yorkers support legalization by a margin of nearly two to one. And many politicians in New York are riding along with the tide toward acceptance, arguing for full legalization soon, and decriminalization now. There is another compelling reason to act quickly on the state law while also exercising discretion on current enforcement. An analysis of crime statistics shows a tremendous racial disparity in the prosecution and sentencing for minor marijuana charges while usage rates in the overall population show no difference. On Long Island, the rate of arrests of minorities for possession of marijuana is quadruple that of whites. The cars of minority drivers are more often stopped and searched by police than those of white people. Since their cars are more often searched, illegal drugs are more often found. In New York City, the rates are similarly skewed, even though they are generated more by searches of people on foot.

The State Legislature wraps up business in Albany next month, so it’s unlikely there will be a change this year despite the growing pressure. And it’s better governance policy that the issue gets debated during the campaigns for statewide office, as well as State Senate and Assembly, that will be decided in November.

Last week, the district attorneys of Manhattan and Brooklyn announced that they would no longer prosecute possession and smoking violations. Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio instructed police to stop making arrests for smoking marijuana in public, telling them to instead issue summonses.

But the other three boroughs have not yet said they will follow Manhattan and Brooklyn on prosecutions. And the police commissioners of Nassau and Suffolk counties say they plan to keep arresting low-level marijuana offenders as long as the law remains unchanged.

Such uneven enforcement creates the potential for a person traveling across the metropolitan area to repeatedly cross in and out of areas where possessing a couple of joints is alternately criminal and acceptable. That makes a mockery of our laws and law enforcement.

The illegal sale of marijuana has to be prosecuted. So does driving under the influence of the drug, which should be treated the same as alcohol or other drugs. But arresting and prosecuting people for possession, an act which is expected to be legal soon, would serve little purpose even if we could enforce the laws without discriminatory results."
178,179,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/legalizing-marijuana-1.18292574,New York should move carefully on legalization of marijuana,"In 2000, when a Pew Research Center poll found 30 percent of Americans supported the recreational use of marijuana, broad legalization of the drug seemed unthinkable. In January, that same poll found 61 percent of Americans supported legalizing the use of marijuana.

What was once unthinkable is becoming unstoppable. But if legal pot is not properly taxed and regulated, the consequences would be unbearable.

Last week was an extraordinary one for legalization momentum. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, once an opponent, said he would introduce federal legislation to decriminalize marijuana and leave regulation to the states. Passage would mean that federal prosecutions and persecutions of users and suppliers, still an issue even in states that have legalized, would no longer be a threat.

Former House Speaker John Boehner, who in 2011 said he was “unalterably opposed” to legalization, last week announced a change of heart. He has joined the board of Acreage Holdings, a multistate marijuana corporation, and says ending the federal prohibition would allow scientific study of the drug’s benefits, assist veterans who can be helped by its use and stem the opioid epidemic. President Donald Trump is signaling he won’t let anti-pot Attorney General Jeff Sessions crack down in the nine states where recreational use is legal, or the 20 more that allow medical marijuana. And the increasing benefits felt by older Americans suffering from chronic pain, cancer, glaucoma and other illnesses have created an unexpected source of support.

In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s gradual conversion from opposing legalization to supporting it is accelerating. Democratic primary opponent Cynthia Nixon’s embrace of full legalization is central to her campaign. Even presumptive Republican candidate Marc Molinaro supports the expansion of medical marijuana and wants to see how full legalization plays out in neighboring states.

The public’s change of heart is justified by data. The path for states that have passed full legalization, while not without bumps, has generally been smooth. There have been no huge surges in crime or addiction, and a growing body of evidence shows opioid use and related deaths decline in states that legalize medical marijuana and drop even more in states that allow recreational use. Tax revenue has flowed in, with marijuana sales generating $250 million for Colorado in 2017. Pointless prosecutions that often disproportionately punished minorities have stopped.

Schumer’s bill and similar ones in the House are not likely to pass yet. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans, and while pro-marijuana sentiment is rising among GOP voters, it’s not yet great enough to force leaders to support legalization.

Right now, the most important decisions are being made at the state level, but it’s becoming clear that federal decriminalization also will be necessary to address some needs.

It’s not a coincidence that the push for full legalization in New York is heating up as legal retail sales creep closer. On New York’s border, Massachusetts stores will throw open their doors on July 1 to sell pot. Maine voters just approved full legalization, and the state is working out the details of retail sales. And New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is pushing for legal sales and use.

A February Siena College poll found that a majority of voters in every region of New York, where a medical marijuana law was passed in 2014, support full legalization. And there is no reason New York should let its marijuana money flee the state, as it did with gambling revenue for decades.

But New York needs to do this right. Strict controls over sales and harsh penalties when they are broken are needed to keep legal marijuana from minors. There needs to be a consensus about licensing and zoning for sales. Where should stores be allowed? Would communities have a say in whether they host stores, and how many? Taxes on marijuana, while not punitive, must raise enough money to fund programs to prevent opioid addiction and expand treatment. Dosage information must be reliable so users don’t inadvertently consume too much.

Police need laws and tools to detect and arrest people who drive stoned. That would be easier with diagnostics and standards funded and developed nationally, as with blood-alcohol levels. Federal legalization could smooth that path. Removing marijuana from the federal drug prohibition schedule would finally allow rigorous research to determine what illnesses and symptoms it alleviates, and what provable health effects its use causes. That information would mean marijuana could be prescribed by doctors for military veterans who need it to treat post-traumatic stress disorder and other issues. Now, Department of Veterans Affairs doctors can’t legally recommend it, much less prescribe it, and have VA benefits pay for it. When it’s a proven medical remedy, Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance also should cover it.

American opinion on marijuana has shifted because it has become clear that the war on marijuana is more damaging to society than its consumption. Change is coming quickly, but there is still time to do legalization right.

179,180,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/cuomo-administration-legal-recreational-marijuana-1.19286315,Official: Health Dept. report will back legal recreational pot,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s health commissioner said Monday his agency will soon issue a report recommending the legalization of recreational marijuana, possibly setting the stage for a dramatic policy shift for the governor.

Dr. Howard Zucker said the health department will release a long-awaited marijuana report in the coming days.

“We realized that the pros outweigh the cons and the report recommends a regulated, legal marijuana program be available to adults in the state of New York,” Zucker said at a news conference in Brooklyn.

If the governor backs the report’s recommendation, it would complete an extraordinary shift for the Democrat. It also would put him on the same page as Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist who is challenging Cuomo for the Democratic nomination from the political left. And it would align New York with a growing number of states that have legalized marijuana.

Another Cuomo election opponent, Republican Marc Molinaro, said the health department’s recommendation was more about Cuomo “sprinting to the left” in an election year than a serious consideration of the issue.

When he took office in 2011, Cuomo initially opposed the legalization not only of recreational marijuana but also of medical marijuana. Pushed by state legislators, he negotiated a new medical marijuana program in 2014, but still opposed recreational marijuana, calling it a “gateway drug.”

In January, Cuomo proposed that the state budget fund a study about potential legalization. Though the provision wasn’t included in the budget adopted in March, Cuomo said in April the health department would conduct the research anyway, saying the “facts” had changed and noting the many other states that have decriminalized marijuana.

Meanwhile, Nixon on April 11 called for legalization of the recreational use of marijuana. She said it was a “social justice” issue and noted the disproportionate number of blacks and Latinos prosecuted for marijuana use compared with whites. She also said it could raise revenue for the state.

Zucker didn’t disclose any further details on what his agency would recommend, such as limits on businesses and tax rates. He didn’t specify a minimum age, but said legalization would be only for “adults.”

Asked for a rationale in the policy switch, Zucker likened it to research driving changes in medical policy.

“This is no different than medicine,” Zucker said. “We have new facts. We have new data.”

Nor was it clear if, how and when the administration might follow through on Zucker’s recommendation. The state Legislature is set to adjourn for the year on Wednesday, meaning no meaningful action could likely occur until 2019 — after this year’s elections.

Cuomo’s office limited its comments to saying it would “review the report when we receive it.”

A Nixon spokeswoman said Zucker’s announcement was being used to “distract” attention from opening arguments Monday in a public corruption trial that focuses on Cuomo’s high-profile economic projects. Nixon aide Lauren Hitt also said the policy shift comes too late for many New Yorkers.

“One year after calling marijuana a ‘gateway drug,’ it shouldn’t have taken Cuomo eight years and #TheCynthiaEffect to understand the ‘facts have changed,’” Hitt said, referring to a term activists have used to describe Cuomo’s shifts to the left in this election year. “Cynthia believes legalizing cannabis is not enough and we must also expunge people’s records and create marijuana equity, setting aside half of its marijuana licenses for low-income residents who have been convicted of a marijuana-related crime or who live in communities disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.”

The Molinaro campaign questioned whether Zucker was providing political cover for Cuomo. It noted that Zucker previously was deployed by Cuomo to write a study that ultimately led the governor to banning — just after the 2014 election — hydraulic fracturing for natural gas.

“There are serious questions to be answered about marijuana,” said Molinaro spokeswoman Katy Delgado. “They should be answered by serious people without a political agenda.”"
180,181,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/opinion/legal-pot-state-by-state-1.20322067,"The push for legal pot, state by state","It is well-established but worth repeating that the War on Drugs is a disaster for everyone it touches. The mass incarceration, gang activity, persecution of people of color, lost tax revenue, and blocked research, all perpetrated by the war, make it one of the nation’s greatest self-inflicted wounds.

Now we are seeing a wave of marijuana legalization, beginning in the West and continuing in the East. After Colorado and Washington led the way, Massachusetts, Maine and Vermont followed suit. Now nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized adult recreational marijuana use.

The benefits brought on by legalization - studies have shown it to reduce crime, curb opioid abuse, decrease teen marijuana use and raise property values - could help catalyze similar initiatives in other states. Michigan is voting on legalization this November, which could pave the way for Pennsylvania, Illinois and Minnesota.

Attention is now on New York and New Jersey, which together represent 29 million people. These two states could be a tipping point for legalization, but that will only occur with substantial and sustained support from the people who live there.

New Jersey has been progressing toward legalization since the election of Democrat Phil Murphy to the governor’s mansion. Lawmakers are hoping to pass a legalization bill this summer, but it’s not clear whether they have the necessary votes. And while some New Jersey cities welcome the arrival of cannabis, about 17 have banned or restricted it within their borders.

In New York, a recent State Department of Health report calling for legalization has moved the needle, and provided some cover for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to embrace the issue as he tries to head off a primary challenge from progressive Cynthia Nixon. The two states are also pressuring each other as they compete to see which will be the first to score the windfall of cannabis enthusiasts arriving on the PATH train or taking the Holland Tunnel.

Citizens in these states who want the laws to change must make their feelings known. Legislators need to feel some heat from their constituents, because many would be content to leave this issue in limbo.

“If this came up as a voter referendum, it would pass overwhelmingly,” New York state Sen. Diane Savino, who authored the state’s medical cannabis bill, told me. “But when you work through the legislative process, there are some members who still aren’t sure.”

Cuomo, with his re-election and potential presidential run at stake, may be particularly sensitive to political pressure.

Even in states where legalization has occurred, differences in how programs are run can have a big impact. For instance, provisions that bar felons from establishing cannabis business licenses can perpetuate the inequalities of the War on Drugs. These can be mitigated with equity provisions, like the one in Massachusetts that provides training and technical assistance and waives fees for cannabis business license applicants from communities disproportionately harmed by the War on Drugs.

Nationwide legalization of marijuana is now likely inevitable. But injustice prolonged is injustice perpetuated. It’s time for New York and New Jersey to advance the issue through legalization. That will increase the pressure on other states and make it more likely that the next Democratic president will soften the federal restrictions around criminalization.

The stakes are high for swift and well-executed legalization in these two states.

The last hurdle preventing Massachusetts-based PalliaTech from breaking ground on the project is securing a building permit, for which it has been waiting since December.

PalliaTech president and CEO Michelle Bodner said the company was “committed to being a good neighbor.”

“We are thrilled to be one step closer to opening in Carle Place and helping patients in Nassau County and Long Island who are suffering from serious, chronic conditions and need the relief that our pharmaceutical-quality medical cannabis products provide,” she said.

The Curaleaf facility would be the second one in North Hempstead Town and Nassau County; the other one opened in January 2016 in Lake Success.

PalliaTech has proposed opening a dispensary with the trade name of Curaleaf at a 3,000-square-foot former optical office at 255 Glen Cove Rd. ERG Commercial Real Estate, the property’s owner, would continue to operate its office on the building’s second floor.

Town spokeswoman Carole Trottere confirmed Thursday that a building permit had not yet been issued. A PalliaTech spokeswoman said the company expects to have the permit in the next few weeks.

PalliaTech’s application was denied in February by the town Building Department because it did not meet the parking requirements mandated under town zoning laws. On Wednesday, the town’s Board of Zoning Appeals approved PalliaTech’s request to have five fewer parking spaces than the required 45 spots.

A PalliaTech spokeswoman said Thursday that the target opening date had since been revised to late summer.

As of May 8, 54,256 patients were registered in New York State to be treated with medical marijuana, which requires a doctor’s certification for individuals with eligible serious illnesses. More than 1,600 practitioners, such as physicians and nurse practitioners, are registered with the program. There are 19 dispensaries open throughout the state, which has authorized doubling the number of dispensaries to 40 — two each are planned for Nassau and Suffolk.

The state Department of Health has also authorized a third Nassau location, which has not been announced, to be operated by Manhattan-based Fiorello Pharmaceuticals. Suffolk, which has one dispensary in Riverhead, will also be getting two new dispensaries, to be operated by Syracuse-based New York Canna and Purchase-based Valley Agriceuticals."
182,183,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/health/marijuana-opiate-1.19308858,"Medical marijuana treats chronic pain in adults, LI study finds","Medical marijuana is a potent method of treating chronic pain in older adults who had been relying on opioids, a Long Island doctor has found in a research project of people mostly in their 60s who suffered from a wide range of pain syndromes.

The survey by Northwell Health coincides with the New York State Department of Health declaring opioid use a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. People can be weaned from opioids by treating chronic pain with medical cannabis, state health officials said Tuesday.

Local doctors already have compelling evidence that medical marijuana helps wean chronic pain patients from heavy-duty narcotic medications.

“What we found was that the patients overwhelmingly had a reduction in their pain with medical cannabis and a reduction in their use of painkillers of all kinds,” said Dr. Diana Martins-Welch, a co-author of the study. She is a specialist in geriatric and palliative medicine at the health system’s division in Manhasset.

She and her colleagues conducted a survey of medical marijuana users between the ages of 61 and 70 and found that 65 percent of them reported relief from chronic pain caused by a wide range of conditions.

Some patients had osteoarthritis, others had painful hips and knees that, for a variety of medical reasons, could not be replaced with artificial joints. Still others suffered from spinal stenosis, which generally occurs when the spaces within the spinal column narrow significantly, putting pressure on spinal nerves. The result is excruciating, round-the-clock pain for which many doctors routinely have prescribed an opioid.

Despite the favorable findings, more studies of medical marijuana and its pain-relieving properties are needed because not enough information is contained within the overall medical literature on which doctors rely, Martins-Welch said.

Medical students receive no instruction on medical marijuana, Martins-Welch said, adding that much of her own knowledge was self-taught.

“The big difference between opioids and medical cannabis is that there is an anti-inflammatory component to cannabinoids,” she said, referring to the medically active constituents of cannabis that are capable of relieving inflammation, which underlies many pain syndromes.

The New York State Department of Health, meanwhile, has announced that it will develop a regulatory amendment to the state’s Compassionate Care Act and add opioid use as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. That action ultimately could help wean patients off opioid drugs by using medical cannabis to treat chronic pain.

“The opioid epidemic in New York State is an unprecedented crisis, and it is critical to ensure that providers have as many options as possible to treat patients in the most effective way,” Dr. Howard Zucker, the state’s health commissioner, said in a statement.

Dr. Maria Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine for the Northwell Health network, says finding alternatives to opioids is critical.

“From an advocacy point of view I am trying to make it easier for doctors to prescribe other pain-management methods so that we can use opioids more responsibly. It’s easier for me to order a fentanyl patch, which is an opioid than it is to order a lidoderm patch, which is not an opioid,” she said.

Insurance coverage is another conundrum, Martins-Welch added Tuesday.

Most health insurers will cover the cost of an opioid medication, she said, but will not cover the cost of medical marijuana, which at about $200 to $300 per month, is a prohibitive amount for some patients to pay."
183,184,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/marijuana-legalization-cuomo-1.16213069,Some LI lawmakers back plan to study marijuana legalization,"ALBANY — Some members of Long Island’s state delegation supported Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s proposal to study legalizing marijuana in the state, but stopped short of saying they would endorse legalization.

Cuomo floated the idea Tuesday during his budget address of funding a Department of Health-led study to look at the economic, health and criminal justice impacts of legalizing recreational marijuana. He said the study should also look at the effects of legalization in Massachusetts — and possibly New Jersey — on New York, as well as any future federal intervention.

“This is an important topic, it is a hotly debated topic — pardon the pun — and it’d be nice to have some facts in the middle of the debate once in awhile,” Cuomo said.

Cuomo did not address details on the potential study, including how much it would cost and how long it would take, during his speech. No actual funding for the study was included in Cuomo’s 2018-2019 budget proposal, though the budget bill dedicates “so much funds as shall be determined necessary” by the state health commissioner.

The state legalized medical marijuana in 2014.

Sen. Elaine Phillips (R-Flower Hill) said her office has conducted a survey in her district and her constituents don’t appear to support recreational marijuana use. However, she said she was open to further research.

“I think we need to do a study,” she said. “I think it’s a smart way of going about it.”

Assemb. Christine Pellegrino (D-West Islip) said she was “encouraged” by Cuomo’s plan.

“I think it is time to look at what the economic impact of legalization could mean for the budget and we could have a real debate on what legalization could mean,” she said. “Let’s really have a full conversation with real information.”

Assemb. Brian Curran (R-Lynbrook) said that while he supported medical marijuana use, he still opposes recreational use, “regardless of any type of revenue” it could bring to the state.

“The bottom line is, in my opinion, it’s still a gateway drug that has resulted in significant problems” in states that have legalized it, he said.

Sen. John Brooks (D-Seaford) said he has always supported medical marijuana and agreed with Cuomo’s idea to study recreational legalization. “I don’t have a problem with our looking at it,” he said.

Assemb. Dean Murray (R-East Patchogue) said while he doesn’t support recreational use — he does support medicinal marijuana — “it’s not a bad idea to do the study.”

184,185,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/state-agrees-to-legalize-medical-marijuana-with-limits-1.8507996,New York State agrees to legalize medical marijuana with limits,"ALBANY -- State lawmakers reached an agreement Thursday that would make New York the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana.

Under the terms of the agreement, the system would prohibit the smoking of marijuana and would allow use only in connection with about 10 diseases and syndromes. The drug would be available only through other forms, such as edibles, oils and vaporizers. Physicians and patients would face criminal penalties for abuse of the system.

The program wouldn't start for at least 18 months. Five regulated manufacturers would be selected to grow the drug in the state and operate four dispensaries each. The drug would have to be cultivated and distributed all within New York borders, and non-state residents wouldn't be eligible for treatment. The state would assess a 7 percent tax on manufacturers.

Additionally, the legislation would authorize medical marijuana for just seven years, with an evaluation after that. Further, it gives the governor power to abruptly stop the program if he sees abuse or other problems, based on input from the state Health Department.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a former opponent of medical marijuana, called that a ""fail-safe"" provision that made him comfortable enough to back the legislation.

""Medical marijuana has the possibility to do a lot of good for a lot of people who are in pain and who are suffering and are in desperate need of a treatment that can provide relief,"" said Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for re-election this fall. ""At the same time, it's a difficult issue because there are also risks that have to be averted -- public-health risks, public-safety risks -- and we believe this bill strikes the right balance.""

Smoking for medical purposes could be allowed in the future, if the Health Department and State Legislature agree.

The state Assembly expected to approve the medical marijuana bill after midnight. The State Senate, where the issue is more contentious delayed a vote until Friday.

The agreement was struck after several days of intense negotiations by legislators and vocal rallies at the State Capitol by medical marijuana supporters. Activists blamed Cuomo for stalling until the final days of the session and accused him of trying to run out the clock. But in the end the governor won many of the concessions he was looking for, most significantly banning smoking, gaining the power to end the program and cutting the number of eligible conditions in about half.

The measure was almost two decades in the making for Assembly Health Committee chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan). ""You know, it's really gratifying after all these years to be able to help some very seriously ill people,"" he said.

His efforts received a big boost this year. Statewide polls this election year showed broad support. Another key was the frequent protests and personal stories told by people, many in wheelchairs and many of them children, suffering pain and chronic seizures that could be eased by marijuana.

""I'm gratified that legislation is going through,"" said Missy Miller, an Atlantic Beach resident who has been among a regular group of those lobbying at the Capitol for months. ""While I'm very happy that we're going to have a program, I'm petrified that my son is not going to live long enough to benefit.""

Miller said she's tried almost 20 medications to ease the seizures endured by her son, Oliver, 14, who has a severe form of epilepsy and uses a wheelchair.

She said children in other states, such as Colorado, have slowed their seizures through medical marijuana.

State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island), the bill's prime Senate sponsor, had called Cuomo's demands ""non-starters"" on Monday. Three days later she was satisfied with the compromise. ""You can't stand in the way,"" she said, noting there are alternate delivery methods. "" . . . If that [smoking] becomes the only thing that stands in the way, you can't say no to that. It just doesn't make any sense.""

Savino said the list of eligible conditions is sufficient for now, but allows for expansion.

Michelle Lee Flores, a partner with the firm Akerman who specializes in marijuana law, said a common misconception after a state legalizes pot is that companies won’t test for the drug during the hiring process or as part of a workplace policy. The reality: Employers have a choice to make.

“They can say, ‘we are not going to test it,’ or they can say, ‘we’re still going to test it and one of the things we’re going to hang our hat on is the fact even though under state law it may be legal, under federal law it is not,’ ” Flores, 50, said. “Even New York’s Compassionate Care Act has two exceptions that say it does not require an employer to do any act that would put the employer in violation of federal law or cause it to lose a federal contract or funding.”

While New York does have a medical marijuana program (the Compassionate Care Act), recreational use remains illegal. But the drug’s legal status in the state could change as more politicians voice support for recreational use. Earlier in July, the state Department of Health issued a report recommending marijuana legalization, arguing that the benefits outweigh the risks.

If state lawmakers do pass legislation to legalize the drug and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs it into law, Flores warned that employees should understand their employer can still enforce a “zero-drug-in-the-workplace policy” by focusing on how impairment by controlled substances at work can negatively affect the company.

“Alcohol is legal to purchase if you’re a certain age, but we also understand that we don’t show up to work drunk or we could be fired,” Flores said. “That’s the paradigm.”

Conversely, an employer might choose to no longer include marijuana on a post-offer, pre-employment drug test, which usually includes pot, opiates, amphetamines, PCP and cocaine.

A good workplace policy, according to Flores, would lay out both state and federal law as it pertains to marijuana and then outline what the company would do if there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is impaired by an illegal substance.

“The key really for me, in guiding clients, is communication; really, truly communication,” Flores added.

The policy also should clearly state whether the company intends to test for marijuana during the hiring process as well as acknowledge whether it will engage in an “interactive process” with regard to medicinal use of the drug.

“In California, you would want to say, ‘don’t tell me what your condition is, but is there some alternative legal under the federal law that you could use instead of cannabis.’ And having that dialogue to at least make sure that you engage in that to determine if there is a reasonable accommodation,” that can be made, Flores explained.

If New York does legalize recreational use of marijuana, there would likely be a time period between when the bill is signed into law and when the law goes into effect, which Flores said should be used by companies to clarify their stance on marijuana use to employees.

“Because once it happens, there seems to be kind of this — I don’t know if it’s a sense of entitlement or what — there are some individuals that think, ‘well it’s legal now; you can’t do anything to me,’ “ she said. “And that’s actually not true.”"
196,197,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/marijuana-legalization-nyc-1.19807677,Marijuana legalization recommended by New York State Department of Health,"Legalizing and regulating marijuana in New York now has the backing of the state Department of Health.

A report released by the health department on Friday states that the benefits of legalizing adult recreational use of the drug outweigh the potential negative effects. The report comes roughly six months after Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked DOH to conduct a thorough assessment of the impacts marijuana legalization could have on the state.

The agency cited various health and tax revenue benefits, as well as a reduction in the disproportionate criminalization and incarceration rates in communities of color, in the assessment’s conclusion.

Officials took a public health approach in their examination, according to state Department of Health Commissioner Howard A. Zucker, interviewing members of various state agencies related to health, public safety, criminal justice, education and economics. Also taken into account was the impact regulated recreational marijuana programs have had in other states.

“This is particularly important because the status quo in NYS is changing as the state shares borders with some jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana and some that are likely to legalize soon,” the report says.

The report also warned of some hurdles that need to be cleared if lawmakers decide to take legislative action, mainly with regard to implementing regulatory standards and testing. Currently, there is only one lab that handles testing for the state’s medical marijuana program.

In order for recreational use of marijuana to become legal in New York, the legislature would have to pass legislation and Cuomo would need to sign it.

Cuomo, who signed the state’s medical marijuana program into law in 2014, has held a relatively conservative view of legalizing recreational use of the drug. If he voices support for the report, it would signal a hefty policy shift. It also would put him on the same page as gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon, who has expressed support for legalizing marijuana if she’s elected.

197,198,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/marijuana-legalization-nyc-1.18558497,"Legalizing marijuana in New York would improve state, city budgets, Stringer says","The state and city budgets could get a high from legalizing marijuana, a new analysis argues.

City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who supports legalization, released a report Tuesday estimating the annual market for marijuana could be as large as $3.1 billion statewide and $1.1 billion citywide and that it could generate as much as $1.3 billion annually in tax revenue.

His office compiled the estimates by applying tax rates similar to those used by states where marijuana is legal to the number of New Yorkers believed to use marijuana, based on the usage rates reported on national surveys. Stringer found the sale surcharges could annually direct $436 million to the state, $336 million to the city and $536 million to other local governments within the state.

Beyond the budgetary boost, Stringer argued legalizing adult use of marijuana would be an equitable move because arrests for smoking marijuana are disproportionately higher among young black and Latino New Yorkers.

“ . . .... This is not just about dollars — it’s about justice,” Stringer said in a statement. “Legalizing marijuana and reclassifying past convictions are critical steps away from failed policies, and the time to take them is now. I support legalizing marijuana and doing what’s right — building up the very communities that criminalization tore down.”

The state legalized marijuana for medical use in 2014. In his budget proposal, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed studying the economic impacts of legalizing marijuana versus keeping it illegal as other nearby state begin to permit its use.

When asked about legalizing marijuana last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was “just not there” due to concerns about steps people may take to dodge related taxes and corporations seizing on the legalization to get younger people hooked on the drug.

In his report, Stringer noted that usage rates among teens have declined in states that legalized marijuana. In Washington and Colorado, marijuana use among 12 to 17-year-olds declined after it was legalized, though the impacts varied among adults, according to the comptroller’s report."
198,199,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/marijuana-legalization-new-york-1.18703556,Medical marijuana expansion could be steppingstone to recreational legalization in New York,"Pioneers of New York’s medical marijuana program are expressing cautious excitement over the prospect of adult use legalization.

“This industry is probably the fastest moving industry there is right now,” said Jeremy Unruh, director of public and regulatory affairs for PharmaCann LLC, which operates a dispensary in the Bronx.

Unruh suggested the state’s medical marijuana program could serve as a steppingstone as lawmakers move closer toward legalizing recreational use of the drug, but he also warned of a much-needed expansion to the current system before the average New Yorker is allowed to legally light up.

“I think that there are some intermediate steps that ought to be taken before adult use comes to fruition, but we’re very encouraged by the openness of policy makers to explore an expansion of the existing medical marijuana program and transition into adult use,” Unruh, 47, said by telephone on Tuesday.

Several state bills have been put forth related to marijuana consumption in New York, including one sponsored by Sen. Liz Krueger that would legalize and tax marijuana for adults over the age of 21.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, has said he would order the NYPD to issue summonses instead of arresting people who are caught smoking marijuana, citing the likelihood of legalization in the future.

The announcement comes amid a flurry of elected officials expressing support for legalizing recreational use, including Public Advocate Letitia James, who has launched a bid to become the state attorney general. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance also recently said that beginning in August, he would no longer prosecute marijuana possession and smoking charges unless the case posed a threat to public safety.

Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

If the state does legalize adult use, NYU professor of public policy Mark Kleiman, 66, said he would like to see a model that is different from the way alcohol or cigarettes are sold, since those industries, he said, exploit consumers who continually buy their products.

“It’s a very bad idea to set up a commercial industry in an abusable commodity,” he said. “I would like to see nonprofits in the business; I would like to see state stores, lots of co-ops.”

There are several issues that need to be resolved, however, before adult use should be legalized, primarily with regard to patient access and statewide testing.

Nicholas Vita, CEO of Columbia Care, which operates a dispensary in Manhattan and is planning to open another in Brooklyn this summer, warned of quality control issues if the state moves too quickly.

“We believe that this is a net positive, particularly if New York does it the way it approached the medical program, which is a very methodical, disciplined rollout that focused on standards and quality,” Vita said of the prospect of marijuana legalization.

Even if there is an increase in operators in New York, Vita believes the state’s focus on quality and control of the product will remain a priority.

“You never want to have any products that are available to the general public that aren’t properly tested,” he added.

Whether it’s the difficulty of finding a physician, affording a physician or having to drive more than two hours to the nearest dispensary, Unruh said a lack of patient access is inhibiting the current program and could prevent adult use legalization from being effective if the issues are not addressed.

While there are about 20 million people living in the state of New York, there are just over 56,000 people enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program. Considering the list of debilitating conditions to qualify, including cancer and HIV, Unruh said the number of certified patients could and should be much higher.

The current medical marijuana program allows 10 licensed companies to operate four dispensaries each, but a bill being considered in the state Senate would allow each of the organizations to open up to 25 dispensaries.

Unruh said the bill would serve a number of goals: improving patient access while simultaneously scaling regulators into a better position for an adult use industry, among them.

“If you’re going from 56,000 patients and 20 dispensaries up to whatever the market looks like in an adult use framework, which I have to think is hundreds and hundreds of thousands of consumers, that’s like going from zero to 1,000,” he said. “They need to figure out how to expand the existing medical program to ramp into that, just from a regulatory perspective.”

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Diane Savino, would also address Vita’s concerns about quality and control by increasing the number of testing facilities in the state from one to three.

Regardless of what adult use legalization comes to look like in the state, Vita said he’s not at all concerned about his company being pushed out of the market.

“There is a huge medical need, and more importantly I think there’s a very substantial demand profile for high quality manufactured products that can be used for lifestyle purposes,” he said.

Kleiman also argued there likely would still be a market for medical marijuana products, particularly for users with compromised immune systems that require a higher contamination standard.

“Leave the producers in place and let the sellers have two windows,” he said.

As New Yorkers watch the progress of decriminalizing marijuana unfold, Vita said he hopes that policy makers are using data rather than emotion to make legislative decisions.

“Ultimately, what we don’t want to happen is for a program to be rolled out that isn’t well thought out and it doesn’t have all of the unintended consequences addressed beforehand,” he said."
199,200,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-marijuana-policy-1.19306794,"NYC marijuana policy perpetuates unfair targeting of people of color, critics say","The de Blasio administration’s new marijuana policy is being panned by community advocates and criminal justice experts who say it will do nothing to address the racial disparity in policing public smoking offenses.

The policy shift, outlined by Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill on Tuesday, dictates that officers should issue summonses for public pot smoking rather than arresting an individual beginning Sept. 1. The de Blasio administration estimates this will lead to 10,000 fewer marijuana arrests per year.

There are, however, several exceptions to the policy that could lead to an arrest, including if a person is on parole or probation; has a warrant out for arrest; doesn’t have identification on them; has a recent history of domestic violence on record; or if their smoking poses a public safety risk. The policy was also announced with a caveat that gives officers “discretion on how to exercise their enforcement powers.”

Attorney Cristina Buccola, founder of CB Counsel and New York Cannabis Bar Association member, said while she believes the new policy is a step in the right direction, she has concerns on how it will be interpreted by officers.

“It seems like there’s still going to be discretion on the part of the NYPD on when this can be escalated into an arrest,” Buccola, 41, said. “My biggest concern is that nothing changes. . .We’ve just said these people still don’t qualify for summonses because of X, Y and Z.”

The new policing policy is the direct result of a 30-day Marijuana Working Group convened by the NYPD in an attempt to resolve inequity in the way marijuana offenses were being enforced, citing a Manhattan District Attorney’s Office report that showed people of color are arrested on low-level marijuana charges at significantly higher rates than white people. In the wake of the report, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said his office would stop prosecuting most marijuana possession and smoking cases beginning Aug. 1.

Several community groups argue the mayor’s new policy will do little to change the status quo, particularly in light of the exceptions listed for an arrest instead of a summons.

Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

“If the mayor wanted to create a plan to make racial disparities in marijuana enforcement worse, he’s accomplished it with this,” Communities United for Police Reform spokeswoman Monifa Bandele said.

Moving from arrests to summonses does nothing to address disparities and instead hides them from view because demographic data on summonses is not publicly released the way arrest data is, according to Bandele.

Nick Encalada-Malinowski, civil rights campaign director for VOCAL-NY, said while the policy may lead to fewer arrests overall, the exceptions listed ensure that the same communities that were previously over policed will continue to be unfairly targeted.

“If you’re on parole and you’re arrested (for pot smoking), you immediately go to Rikers Island. . .You’re basically compounding collateral consequences on top of each other,” he said, adding that since people of color are arrested for marijuana offenses at a higher rate, the mayor’s plan directly conflicts with seeking to reduce racial disparity.

In announcing the new policy, de Blasio said he believes it will strike a balance between safety and fairness — a middle ground the mayor says he has sought for years.

The NYPD made 19,000 arrests for possession in 2017 — down 64 percent compared with 53,000 arrests in 2010, according to the mayor’s office. While 50,000 of the 2010 arrests were related to smoking in public, that specific offense made up less than 17,000 of the arrests in 2017.

Queens District Attorney Richard Brown called the policy “wise.”

“By choosing this sensible path, by which only the presence of limited aggravating factors will justify an arrest, the police department will continue to have the ability to control the activity without the majority of those committing the offenses being arrested and put through the system,” he said.

Several New Yorkers in midtown Tuesday afternoon said they believed the new policy will be helpful.

“I think it is going to take away imprisonment for a lot of people who don’t deserve to go to prison,” said Steven Alcivar, 28, of Bed-Stuy. “I think they can focus on other things they need to focus on.”

David Chametzky, 49, who grew up in Brooklyn and lives on Long Island, said he believes people should be allowed to smoke freely but also expressed concern for public safety.

“The problem is if they are on the roads. If they are walking on the street, I have no problem. Smoke away.”

The loophole of allowing police to use discretion in whether a person should be arrested, however, appears to be a sticking point for critics.

“My understanding of the new policy is explicit that police can arrest anyone as long as they can come up with some justification for it,” Encalada-Malinowski said. “They could come up to someone and say, ‘hey, put that out and move on.’ But they can also use this discretion to arrest someone who shouldn’t be arrested.”

The language used by the mayor’s office is reminiscent of discretion issues found with the now-banned stop-and-frisk policy, Buccola said.

“Historically, we find these exceptions that always defer to police to exercise their power, but how are we gauging that?” she asked. “When we default to discretion, there’s no bright-line test.

“We had it in stop and frisk and we’re going to have it here unless we recognize what actually poses a public safety risk.”

Training police officers to understand when public smoking poses a public safety risk and when it’s a case of implicit bias will be a key factor in how successful the rollout of the new policy is, according to Buccola.

The mayor will order the NYPD, which is currently holding a 30-day working group that examines its marijuana policing methods, to stop arresting New Yorkers who smoke up in public and to instead issue them summonses.

He also announced an interagency task force that will convene to investigate issues surrounding the potential legalization of pot, such as policing, “facility siting, public health, education, small business engagement, and economic fairness,” according to a City Hall spokesman.

De Blasio previously has been cautious when it comes to marijuana legalization, citing concerns over “the corporatization” of the substance, but he said the city should be ready with a legal framework when decriminalization arrives.

“With marijuana legalization likely to occur in our state in the near future, it is critical our city plans for the public safety, health, and financial consequences involved,” de Blasio said in a statement.

The Daily News first reported the announcement on Sunday afternoon.

During his weekly appearance on “The “Brian Lehrer Show” Friday, de Blasio discussed some of the issues he had when it came to enforcing laws once pot was legal.

“The dynamics of how you decide to address that, which type of measure you use — whether it’s arrest, or summons or some other measure, and how you make sure that enforcement is fair and equal — is a discussion in every state,” he said.

“The 30-day working group on marijuana enforcement is underway, and this issue is certainly part of that review,” said NYPD spokesman Phillip Walzak. “The working group is reviewing possession and public smoking of marijuana to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust, while also promoting public safety and addressing community concerns.”

Responding to data showing a racial disparity in arrests, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill told the City Council last week that officers do not target minority marijuana users.

Curaleaf New York is set to open a new dispensary in Forest Hills on July 10, broadening the availability of medical-grade cannabis in the borough for patients with cancer, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and other qualifying conditions.

The new dispensary, located at 107-18 70th Rd., will be the sixth such operation to open in New York City and the second to launch in Queens, according to the New York State Medical Marijuana Program website. The first dispensary in the borough, run by Vireo New York, opened in nearby Elmhurst in 2016.

“Medical marijuana has already helped tens of thousands of New Yorkers and we are excited to welcome patients to our Forest Hills dispensary to access the treatment they need or learn more about medical marijuana and the state’s program,” said Michelle Bodner, president of PalliaTech NY, which operates the dispensary under the Curaleaf New York brand.

Centrally located between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street, the 3,000-square-foot dispensary will offer cannabis products in several forms, including tablets, oils, tinctures, capsules and under-the-tongue strips. It will be managed by a New York-licensed pharmacist and counselors will be on hand to help patients determine the best course of treatment based on their condition.

Prospective patients are urged to call 833-470-5323 to set up an appointment ahead of the dispensary’s grand opening.

In order to purchase products from a medical marijuana dispensary, the Department of Health requires patients with qualifying conditions to obtain certification from a physician who participates in the state’s program. Patients can then register online to receive a medical marijuana card, which needs to be presented at the dispensary.

As of June 26, there were 60,680 certified medical marijuana patients in the state, though it was unclear how many live in Queens. A request for data specific to the borough was not immediately returned by the state health department.

203,204,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/smoking-marijuana-brooklyn-1.20145591,"Marijuana prosecutions for low-level offenses in Brooklyn dropped over 91 percent in 2018, DA says","The prosecution of low-level marijuana offenses in Brooklyn fell by over 91 percent in the first half of 2018, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced Friday.

The steep drop in prosecution rates stems from an expansion of an existing pilot policy on misdemeanor pot offenses to include cases of smoking in public. Combined with a 60 percent decrease in marijuana arrests, the district attorney’s office has seen a declination rate of over 70 percent so far this year, according to Gonzalez.

“Aggressive enforcement and prosecution of personal possession and use of marijuana does not keep us safer, and the glaring racial disparities in who is and is not arrested have contributed to a sense among many in our communities that the system is unfair,” Gonzalez said in an emailed statement Friday. “This in turn contributes to a lack of trust in law enforcement, which makes us all less safe.”

The number of cases accepted for prosecution in Brooklyn went from 349 in January to 29 in June — a decrease of 91.6 percent, according to the district attorney’s office. Of the cases that were prosecuted in the first six months of the year, 84 percent were dismissed.

Eight cases that were prosecuted resulted in a misdemeanor conviction and a majority of the remaining cases ended with pleas to noncriminal charges. The individuals involved in the eight cases that resulted in convictions had prior criminal records, the district attorney’s office said.

The expanded pilot policy reduced the number of court proceedings for low-level marijuana crimes, which freed up resources and strengthened the public’s trust in the criminal justice system, the district attorney said.

Citing the policy’s success, Gonzalez said his office would continue to decline prosecuting low-level marijuana cases unless a person poses a serious threat to public safety, such as driving with burning marijuana or smoking on public transportation.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill had announced in June that beginning Sept. 1, New Yorkers caught smoking marijuana in public would face criminal summonses instead of arrest. The policy change came out of a 30-day working group convened by O’Neill to address racial disparities in the way marijuana laws are enforced in the city.

204,205,NY,www.amny.com,https://www.amny.com/news/marijuana-legalization-police-1.18754478,Ex-NYPD officers back marijuana legalization after careers policing street-level users,"As a narcotics cop with the NYPD, Joanne Naughton made countless low-level, marijuana-related arrests. At the time, she believed she was doing the right thing. She wholeheartedly supported the war on drugs.

It was only when she retired from the force in 1987 and started teaching criminal justice at Mercy College that it dawned on her: the war on drugs was counter-productive and harmful, and was ruining the lives of those she herself had locked up.

Naughton is part of an organization called Law Enforcement Action Partnership or LEAP, which consists of a network of former members of the criminal justice system who advocate for an end to drug prohibition, and more recently, also tackle criminal justice issues. As a speaker for the organization, Naughton strives to voice support for marijuana legalization, a policy that’s being heavily debated amongst New York lawmakers.

“All we did was make life harder and harder for people who, many of them, already had a problem. If someone is addicted to anything, it’s taken over their life,” Naughton said, stressing that drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal justice one. “Cops can’t fix that. Prosecutors can’t fix that. Courts can’t. Jails can’t.”

Sitting alongside Naughton and nodding heavily was retired NYPD Deputy Inspector Corey Pegues, who said that in his 21 years with the force, he had never come across an incident where smoking marijuana was the “aggravating factor,” or the reason that led someone to commit a crime.

“Time is up. We need to get rid of [prohibition]. We keep locking up black and brown young kids, ruining their lives, their families. It has to stop,” Pegues, who also is a speaker with LEAP, said. “You can’t lock your way up out of drug addiction.”

‘All about the numbers’

Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In the past three years across New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people, and Hispanic people were arrested for similar offenses at five times the rate of white people, a New York Times analysis found. While marijuana-related complaints were lodged with 311 or with the police department at the same rate, arrests were made at higher rates in neighborhoods with predominantly black and brown residents, the Times report added.

Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the NYPD makes 20,000 marijuana-related arrests per year, according to a study done by the Marijuana Arrest Research Project and commissioned by the Drug Policy Alliance. Eighty-six percent of those arrestees are blacks or Latinos, the study found.

“You go where it’s easy to find people. You go where there are people hanging out, people playing outside, young people,” Naughton said of NYPD policing tactics during her career. “Of course, you don’t want to upset people who might have political power. You don’t want to go into neighborhoods where people with political power might live.”

Echoing her reasoning, Pegues, who used to be a drug dealer before he became a cop, said that police “don’t even look for” crime in white neighborhoods, if they can go straight to the minority community.

As for why they put up with such tactics, Pegues said, “It’s all about the numbers game.”

In 1994, the NYPD developed a management tool that recorded crime statistics called CompStat. As a police officer before and after the implementation of the model, Pegues stressed how policing tactics transformed from “reactive” to “proactive.”

Quality-of-life issues, such as urinating on the street or drinking in public, started being policed more, which reflected in the arrest numbers, he said. At regular CompStat meetings, Pegues said he felt pressured to maintain or increase arrest numbers to convince his superiors of a decrease in crime in his precinct, he added.

“Throughout my career, I would always see drug addicts, crackheads, alcoholics — that’s what [police officers] were bringing into the precinct all the time. They get their numbers, bring people in, like a warehouse or a factory. It just goes and goes and goes” he added.

The NYPD needs to figure out a better way to assess if police officers are doing a good job, Naughton said. It can’t just be about the numbers, she said.

“You do what you’re supposed to do. You do what’s required of you,” Naughton said, defending her narcotics policing. “It’s a job, to pay the mortgage and to buy clothes and put food on the table.”

Both ex-cops stressed that the police department is a hierarchical organization, where orders trickle from the top down. Cops do not make policy, Pegues and Naughton stressed.

Decriminalization just a ‘Band-Aid?’

Recently, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced that in light of marijuana-related arrest disparities between black and brown and white people, his office would stop prosecuting pot offenses beginning August 1. Recently, de Blasio announced that he would order the NYPD to stop arresting people for smoking pot in public, and issue them summonses instead.

While a step in the right direction, Naughton said that simply decriminalizing marijuana is not enough. A summons still means that the law was violated, she said. It means that the person who received the summons would have to take time off of work and go to court, which they might not be able to do without incurring financial consequences. If they ignore the summons, an arrest warrant would be issued for them, she added.

Calling the decriminalization policy “a Band-Aid over a four-inch gash,” Pegues said that a summons-based approach would still be a burden on the community.

Currently, there is a 30-day working group within the NYPD researching marijuana enforcement tactics.

“The NYPD will review our practices to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust at the root of neighborhood policing,” according to a statement made by police Commissioner James O’Neill on May 15. “The NYPD has no interest in arresting New Yorkers for marijuana offenses when those arrests have no impact on public safety.”

The merits of decriminalizing marijuana is being debated on the state level as well as among city politicians. The release of a study commissioned by Gov. Andrew Cuomo regarding the effects of marijuana legalization is imminent. A New York state senator also has recently expressed optimism for a bill that would legalize marijuana statewide.

Naughton believes that marijuana legalization would largely stamp out the street trade, comparing the likely demise of illicit sales to bootleggers becoming irrelevant after Prohibition ended.

“People we put in jails and prisons are people with addictions. How are we helping them? They too deserve to be helped. They’re decent people,” Naughton said. “We call them ‘junkies’ but they are people.”

Nodding, Pegues added, “We need to free up police to actually do police work.”"

In two years, the growing and manufacturing expanded from s from four rooms to 48,000 square feet

The electronic latch released with a click and Corey Hewitt opened the door onto a searingly bright room filled wall to wall with rows of lush, green marijuana plants.

“This is not Cheech and Chong’s garage,” said Hewitt, who is in charge of the growing, manufacturing and sale of medical marijuana to patients for Columbia Care New York.

This is the bloom room, where plants spend a couple of months producing robust buds that will be harvested and crushed to extract oil that is turned into medicine.

Scientists with degrees in fields such as biology, botany, biomedical engineering, forestry, chemistry and packaging science oversee each step. Until now, seeing how they do it has been like trying to peer through the brick of Building 12 at Eastman Business Park that houses cultivation and manufacturing operations.

CLOSE D&C reporters Patti Singer and Sean Lahman answer questions about medical marijuana from our Facebook audience. Patti Singer, Sean Lahman, Virginia Butler

Columbia Care is among 10 companies — and one of the original five — licensed by New York state to make and sell medical marijuana. Each company is allowed one manufacturing facility and four dispensaries. The company is licensed in 12 jurisdictions around the nation. Because THC, the psychotropic compound that gives the feeling of euphoria, is illegal at the federal level, the product can't cross state lines. So the company has multiple manufacturing sites.

The Columbia Care facility at Eastman Business Park makes all the products for its dispensary at Building 28 (Theater on the Ridge) and for its other dispensaries in Manhattan and Riverhead on Long Island, and the one it is opening in Brooklyn. Columbia Care had allowed media to see the dispensary when it opened, and I'd written numerous stories about the company. Over the past two years, I’d asked several times to see the manufacturing side.

Columbia Care received permission from the state Department of health, which regulates every aspect of medical marijuana, to provide a tour exclusively to the Democrat and Chronicle. Hewitt said that based on the increased number of people certified to use medical marijuana in New York and also Columbia Care’s own growth, the time was right to show what goes on.

'Like being in a Christmas tree farm'

The elevator door opened onto a hallway and a smell hit me.

“It’s the plant material,” said Hewitt, who was my guide along with security chief James Sinclair. “It’s like smelling pine. It’s like being in a Christmas tree farm.”

It didn’t smell that fresh in the relatively stagnant air of the industrial corridor. A little like old oregano, a little acrid like a skunk wandered by a while ago.

He said you can’t get high from just being around the plants, so if I thought I was feeling their effect, it would be my imagination.

Hewitt said some parts of the tour would be off the record, but he wanted me to see the whole process. Before we could see the plants, though, we had to don lab coats, put booties over our shoes and caps over our hair.

“There are bugs and things outside that could be on our clothing and potentially risk the crops,” Hewitt said. “We’re very careful to make sure we minimize it as much as possible.”

Nothing is grown from seed, which means plants are cloned from other plants. We started where that process begins — with the mother stock in what's called the mom room.

Dozens of plants stood under LED lights. Cultivation manager Casey Berg said the moms last four to six months. No worries about menopause. To make the next generation, branches from the moms are cut and put in soil, something similar to what a home gardener might do.

But Berg watches over hundreds if not thousands (Hewitt declined to give the number) of plants that are the basis for the whole operation.

Once a cutting is put into soil, it’s put under a dome to control humidity until the plant takes root and is strong enough to be potted. The process can take four weeks.

A plant spends another four weeks in the vegetation room until it’s moved to the bloom room.

Every plant gets a barcode and other identifiers so it can be tracked even after it’s made into a product. “God forbid if we ever have a product recall, we’re able to go right back to the mom strain and identify where it came from,” Hewitt said.

Strict rules for growing, touching, harvesting

Columbia Care grows hundreds of strains across the nation based on individual state regulations and the company’s research on the role of medical cannabis. In New York, Columbia Care primarily grows two strains. One strain has a high content of THC, which can be used to relieve pain. The other has a high content of CBD (cannabidiol), which can be used against inflammation. They are combined into vapes, tablets and tinctures in different ratios to treat different conditions.

The strains are kept separate throughout the process, even in the bloom room where they stay eight to 10 weeks until harvest.

Columbia Care has multiple bloom rooms. I wanted sunglasses when we walked into this one.

Squinting until my eyes adjusted, I saw that most of the plants were of uniform height and deep green. Large fans throughout the room created a breeze to keep the leaves moving, and here the scent was cleaner and more outdoorsy.

But it wasn’t like strolling through Highland Park, where I could walk up to a plant and feel whether its leaves were soft or tacky.

Hewitt was clear: Don’t touch. Cannabis is a Schedule I drug according to federal law, and I was not certified to handle the plant. I kept my hands to myself, trying to avoid the leaves like they were poison ivy, but the rich green fronds brushed my lab coat as I walked the narrow aisles between the movable metal beds.

The bloom room is like a massive greenhouse. Employees were pruning, but these cuttings would not be used for new plants. Instead, they would be destroyed under strict guidelines from the state health department.

All the plants are female and there is no sexual reproduction, Berg said. They start to bud after two to three weeks. To get the plants to fully flower, Berg mimics the shorter days of fall by reducing the lighting.

Berg reached for a bloom and pointed out the crystals that hold most of the cannabinoid, a compound that the oil and ultimately the medicine comes from.

Harvesting the plants is like shucking corn, Hewitt said. Employees wear protective clothing, put on gloves and strip the buds and leaves into a bucket. The leaves have some cannabinoid and will be ground up with the bud. According to state Department of Health regulations, the stalks have to be rendered inert and then thrown out.

The buds and whatever leaves come off are put on trays in a drying room. The lighting is subdued, and big racks holding the buds look like something you’d see in a bakery. Instead of the aroma of dough, I got whiffs of what pine tar might smell like.

The scent was stronger in the room where the buds are ground into a fine powder. I wanted to grab a handful, feel if it was as fuzzy as it looked or see if it would sift through my fingers like sand on the beach. But it’s illegal and I'm a law-abiding citizen. Besides, cameras are everywhere and security guards are burly ex-football players.

Turning powder into oil

The next step is to extract the oil from that powder.

“Think about the perfume industry, rose petals, how you get perfume,"" Hewitt said. “Decaf coffee is similar.”

James Kingsley, dressed in scrubs and looking like he’d be at home in a hospital, runs the extraction process, which uses carbon dioxide at very high pressure to squeeze out the oil.

The THC and CBD strains still are separate. “It’s easier for us to make the final product,” Hewitt said. “Imagine if you wanted vanilla-chocolate ice cream and you threw it all together. It’s easier to make vanilla on one side, chocolate on the other.”

There’s more to do before the oil can be made into a vape, tablet or tincture.

Hewitt compared this step to cooking ground beef. Even if you drain the fat, you’ll get some sludge after it’s been in the fridge. In the case of cannabis oil, that congealed substance is called wax. Chemist Zulema Melchor runs a process that leaches and filters out the wax. The apparatus where this happens had a rusty brownish stain. She also tests for potency and how long it takes before the oil degrades.

“At the end of the process, you’ll have pure oil,” Hewitt said, showing a freezer full of containers stockpiled for current and future needs. “Now we can start to build (products).”

Educated workforce makes medical marijuana

Columbia Care started dispensing medical marijuana in January 2016. Hewitt said the company has less than 200 employees statewide, but he did not give the figure for the dispensary and the manufacturing sites in Rochester.

Berg was among the first.

The 29-year-old has a bachelor’s degree in plant science from Rutgers. I asked him if he had the job everyone wants.

“So I hear.”

If the 450 applicants for a packaging job are any indication, Columbia Care is a popular place to work. But the company is picky.

“We’re not just taking people off the street and saying hey, come plant marijuana, it’s fun,” Hewitt said. “We’re very serious about who we bring in and making sure we get the best education levels.”

Columbia Care has several graduates from the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology. Every prospective employee undergoes a background check that includes their social media history and running their fingerprints through law enforcement databases.

Once hired, employees get extensive job, safety and security training. Despite working in what seems like lockdown, employees are free to talk about what they do. Hewitt said when someone asks what he does and he tells them, “I don’t hear, ‘Are you in the stoner building?’ ” Instead, he said he gets questions about whether medical marijuana would work for their mom with dementia.

Turning marijuana oil into medicine

Think of chefs combining ingredients into the perfect recipe that turns out exactly the same time and again. The chemists at Columbia Care do pretty much the same thing.

Hewitt said that for products used to relieve pain, promote sleep and stimulate appetite, more THC is added. To treat seizures, neuropathy or post-traumatic stress disorder, more CBD is used. CBD also can counteract the euphoric effect of THC, according to information provided by Columbia Care. All products also are available in a 1:1 ratio. (A medical provider who certifies a person to receive the medication can recommend the ratio, or the Columbia Care pharmacists can make the decision after meeting with the individual.)

Samples of each lot are tested by the state to make sure they conform to standards of purity and potency.

To make tablets, for example, the chemist would determine the proper amount of THC and CBD for the ratio being created, add filler material to create a powder and put the mixture into a hopper that feeds into die cavities on a rotating table. As the table spins, force is applied to each cavity to form the tablets.

While much of the process is high-tech with lots of moving parts, some of it remains labor intensive. Tincture bottles are filled by squirting the liquid through a hand-held pipette. Package cartons are glued one at a time. Each product is made in the same sterile area, so the line has to be cleaned between batches.

But that’s changing.

Keeping up

Buy Photo Corey A. Hewitt is the director of Columbia Care in New York State. (Photo: Tina MacIntyre-Yee/@tyee23/staff photographer)

Twice in 2017, the state health department changed regulations — first adding chronic pain to the list of conditions that could be treated and then letting companies make topicals, dissolvable lozenges and nonsmokable ground-plant material.

Hewitt said the company spent 2017 refining its processes and bulking up inventory of oil for all its products. Instead of batches of 2,000, it’s now making lots in the tens of thousands. I stood in the secure vault that would stymie Superman and saw the plastic totes full of products that are transported under strict chain of custody to the dispensaries.

Hewitt declined to provide the number of Columbia Care clients but said growth has been in proportion to increased demand statewide. As of May 8, there were 54,256 people certified by 1,615 practitioners to use medical marijuana, according to the Department of Health website. Hewitt said the average age of Columbia Care customers is 54, and the gender mix is about 50-50.

Columbia Care used to do everything in four rooms. To keep up with demand, the cultivation and processing operations are expanding into 48,000 of the 253,000 total square feet available in Building 12.

The increased elbow room includes separate areas for different products, so multiple lines can be made at once. He also said that by the end of the year, filling tinctures will be fully automated. As of the past week, the process to fold and glue the boxes became automated.

Hewitt said the company’s goal is to be able to act like any other pharmaceutical company if the federal government someday relaxes rules around marijuana.

I asked Hewitt if Columbia Care were getting ready for New York to legalize recreational marijuana, as some of its neighbors are doing.

“We’ll see what happens,” he said. “The goal today is medical. … It’s about sick patients. It’s about the quality of our products and … making sure they’re consistent and reliable.”

ALBANY - New York's health regulators are nearing completion of a much-anticipated study of recreational marijuana that could clear the way for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to support legalizing the drug.

The state Department of Health has signaled it will soon submit its findings to Cuomo, who has softened his anti-marijuana stance over the years as legalization has drawn more public support.

The expected release of the study — which is examining the impact recreational marijuana would have on New York — comes after the state Democratic Party threw its weight behind a bill to legalize the drug, passing a resolution at its convention Wednesday supporting the measure.

Timeline: Andrew Cuomo's changing position on marijuana

In a statement, Health Department spokeswoman Jill Montag said the agency has been ""working to assess the health, economic and criminal justice impact of a regulated marijuana program in New York state and to explore the impact on New York of marijuana legalization in surrounding states.""

""The Department will submit its findings to the governor soon,"" Montag said.

Cuomo's position

Cuomo — who has long opposed recreational marijuana — first launched the marijuana study in January, citing moves by neighboring states like Massachusetts and Vermont to legalize the drug.

In April, the Health Department signaled the study would be a longer-term project, promising to ""collect the relevant information"" by the fall before preparing a report.

Cynthia Nixon wants to legalize marijuana in New York

The timeline, however, has since been aggressively accelerated.

On May 14, Cuomo surprised reporters when he said the report would be completed ""within days"" — not the fall, as the Health Department previously said.

His comments came as he faced pressure from liberal-minded Democrats to back legalization, particularly from his primary challenger Cynthia Nixon, the Sex and the City star who is challenging him from the left.

Nixon called for marijuana legalization on April 11.

Legislative approval

Any effort to legalize marijuana, however, would need support from the state Legislature.

The Democratic Party's resolution specifically backed the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, a bill that would legalize, tax and regulate the drug while vacating previous marijuana convictions that would no longer be a crime.

Sen. Liz Krueger, D-Manhattan, who sponsors the bill, said she welcomed the party's support.

The issue is one of racial justice, she said; People of color are convicted under the state's marijuana laws at a much higher rate than white people.

""I actually think here in New York, the people are way ahead of the politicians in what they believe is the right answer for New York state,"" Krueger said of marijuana legalization.

""It's been the politicians — and I guess I'm one of them — who have been behind the public opinion and the public knowledge base as to why this is the right thing for the state and the nation.""

Her bill, however, would need support from the Senate's Republican leadership if it were to be put to a vote this legislative session, which wraps up June 20.

There are currently 32 Democrats in the 63-seat Senate, enough for a bare majority. But one Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, sits with the GOP, giving Republicans control of the chamber.

Scott Reif, spokesman for Senate Republicans, didn't tip the conference's hand, but said the GOP is rather focused on reducing taxes, aiding businesses and ""keeping families and communities safe.""

""Let the governor and others focus on legalizing drugs,"" Reif said. ""Affordability, opportunity, security — those are our priorities for the remainder of the year.”

When, not if

Leaders in the Democrat-led Assembly, meanwhile, have said positive things about marijuana legalization in recent days.

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, told reporters at the Democratic convention that New Yorkers' views on marijuana have ""evolved.""

But he said the debate shouldn't be just about whether to legalize the drug, but also about the ""affect the criminalization of marijuana has had on people"" in the past.

""There’s a lot of issues that we have to address,"" he said. ""It’s not just whether we legalize it.""

On Friday, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, Monroe County, said he has two concerns about marijuana legalization: the long-term impacts, particularly among those with addictive traits; and how to determine whether someone has been driving under the influence of the drug.

But Morelle, who is running for Congress, said he believes legalization is a matter of when, not if.

""I don't know if it's the next six months, the next year, but I think it's coming,"" he said on WXXI's Connections.

Any day, week or month now, the state Department of Health will tell New Yorkers why it’s recommending marijuana be legal for recreational use.

In mid-June, Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said the pros of marijuana outweigh the cons and said his department would release its report on the subject “soon.”

A Health Department spokeswoman this week referred to Zucker’s statement when she responded to a request to narrow down the time frame.

If the Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo agree with the Health Department’s findings, New York would join states such as Colorado, Nevada, California and Massachusetts that have legalized marijuana for recreational use.

Considering the strict controls on medical marijuana, it’s natural to think recreational use would be tightly regulated. Nicholas Vita is chief executive officer of Columbia Care, whose manufacturing facility at Eastman Business Park makes medicinal cannabis for all its New York dispensaries. Vita talked with the Democrat and Chronicle about how he thinks the state should handle legalization.

Should recreational rules be as tight as the medical ones?

Vita said New York needs to focus on the quality of the products and controlling access. He said the state needs to protect teens and others “that could end up being collateral damage in an unregulated, unsupervised environment. … It requires balance between enforcement, social justice, public policy, public health — all of those things deserve a voice. The biggest failure, if you look at other markets, is enforcement hasn’t been given an adequate role in the process.”

Are you being asked how you’d regulate recreational use?

“No, not yet. … I hope we have a voice.” He said that despite criticisms of the medical program, the program has operated with an integrity crucial to its success. He said recreational cannabis manufacturers have to show the same diligence.

“As long as you have responsible operators that are qualified, who are interested in supporting their communities and supporting the program — whatever the program may look like — I think you’ll end up a success. I think the risk is that once you begin to underregulate … you could end up with a free-for-all. That’s not good for anybody.”

Are you saying recreational marijuana would be a burden?

I think there are additional responsibilities.” Vita said people often compare cannabis to alcohol, which is strictly regulated from manufacture to sale — including how old you can be to use it. It’s the same with tobacco. He acknowledged that both of those end up in the hands of teens.

Vita said that because of how cannabis products are made, he couldn’t be specific how the product should be regulated, but it had to be inaccessible to children. He said that in some states, the move to recreational use has been rough and polls show that residents who support recreational use are not pleased with how it’s being implemented.

“The question is, can we together come up with a smarter approach, a more effective approach to maintain the integrity of what it is we’re trying to do in a broad setting?”

Does Columbia Care want to make marijuana for recreational use?

Columbia Care has been expanding its manufacturing facility for medical products, and you'd think that recreational use could boost business overall. As of May, Columbia Care employed fewer than 200 people in New York. The number of workers in Rochester was not available.

Vita was vague about the company's plans for recreational marijuana.

He said some politicians don’t want the medical manufacturers involved. “I think that would be a mistake and a shame.” He said the manufacturers in New York produce high-quality products — experience that can be valuable in the recreational market. “How or whether or not we participate is a function of time and regulation. … Ultimately, we need to play to our strengths.”

How would recreational use affect the drug as medicine?

Even though New York has expanded the diagnoses that qualify for medical marijuana, it still is a limited list. Because of that, Vita said many people use cannabis on their own and self-medicate.

“There are people that simply can’t fall asleep at night or have an eating disorder or have anxiety,” he said. Because they don’t qualify for medical marijuana in New York, they could be considered recreational users.

Vita called that a shame. “My suspicion and my hope is, as we begin thinking about the expansion of regulations and expansion of access, it’s done so in a way that embraces people who are using cannabis as a form of chronic relief, as a form of palliative relief, as a form of improvement of quality of life.”

Legal recreational use also would give those individuals an option subject to quality control, unlike street products they may currently be buying.

“There’s no reason why anybody in the world should have to buy something where there hasn’t been validation,” he said. “That is a shame and it’s inappropriate.”

Why would the government ever legalize another addictive drug?



In my 40 years of working in the field of addictions, I have reviewed — literally — hundreds of articles and studies on marijuana.

I have never seen one study that even hints that marijuana is a protective factor for positive youth development. I have never seen one study that states that marijuana use supports healthy families. I have never seen one study that concludes that marijuana use builds strong communities.

In fact, overwhelmingly, the findings are exactly the opposite for all three cases.

Popular opinion today suggests that marijuana is a benign drug and does not warrant the concern or apprehension of the past generation. However, scores of scientific studies have demonstrated the harmful effects and serious adverse consequences of marijuana use to both youth, young adults, and adults.

Research on the health and safety effects of marijuana strongly correlates with many mental, emotional, psychological, physical and spiritual problems. In addition, many crimes, accidents, job and school performance problems have been associated with the use of marijuana.



While not everyone that uses marijuana becomes drug dependent, the reality is that marijuana use, as with alcohol and other drugs, certainly can lead to profound, chronic and progressive chemical dependency. The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimates that from 9 to about 16 percent of users will become cannabis dependent.



Its use can be very serious, dangerous, and have a profound impact upon the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Americans and their families. Society disregards the inherent dangers, but before they know it at least 10-to-25 percent of users experience problems — many grave and even catastrophic consequences.



And now with marijuana products having THC as high as 90 percent (an increase in THC from the 1-to-3 percent ratio in the 1960s), it makes the drug even more dangerous and addictive. Thousands of marijuana-dependent individuals have testified that marijuana use had a significant negative impact on their lives, and many admitted that quitting marijuana is much more difficult than quitting alcohol or even cocaine.



Marijuana has destroyed the dreams and the quality of life for countless youth and families. It is not the benign, innocuous, natural “herb” substance that some people make it out to be. And one of the greatest dangers of marijuana is that it is underestimated as a powerful pharmacologic, mind-altering substance. In this regard, marijuana is not fully appreciated for what it really is — a drug of addiction that will have devastating effects on our families.

ALBANY — A much-anticipated study on recreational marijuana will recommend legalizing the drug in New York, the state's top health regulator said Monday.

Howard Zucker, New York's health commissioner, told reporters in Brooklyn that the Department of Health's ongoing study on marijuana in New York is nearly finished and has concluded the state should move ahead with legalizing and regulating the drug.

The study will soon be finalized and delivered to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who ordered the study in January after neighboring states Massachusetts and Vermont took action to allow marijuana for recreational purposes.

""We looked at the pros, we looked at the cons,"" Zucker said.

""And when we were done, we realized that the pros outweigh the cons and the report recommends that a regulated, legal marijuana program be available to adults in the state of New York.""

Zucker said the study, which was performed by the Department of Health, looked at a variety of issues surrounding marijuana legalization, including where it would be grown, how it would be distributed and how much it should be taxed.

It also considered what the minimum age to possess and use marijuana should be.

He did not release any of the specifics of the study or give a timetable for its release, other than to say it would be completed ""soon.""

Public support

A poll released last month by Quinnipiac University showed a majority of New York voters support legalizing ""small amounts"" of marijuana for personal use.

All told, 63 percent of those polled said they support it, including 71 percent of Democrats. Republicans were more wary: 56 percent were opposed.

Cuomo, meanwhile, has been slower to embrace legal marijuana than many within his party, calling it a ""gateway drug"" as recently as last year.

But Cuomo launched the marijuana study in January amid the movement by neighboring states, tasking the Department of Health and other state agencies with weighing the implications.

Legalizing the drug will likely have to wait until 2019 at the earliest.

The state Legislature is scheduled to end its 2018 session on Wednesday, and the Republicans who lead the narrowly divided state Senate haven't embraced legalization. All 213 state legislative seats are on the ballot this year.

Latest reaction

Advocates for marijuana legalization were pleased to hear Zucker's comments Monday, but said they will wait to see the full study before embracing his position.

In particular, advocates are hoping the report addresses the criminal justice issues related to marijuana legalization, including what to do with prior convictions under the state's marijuana laws.

""We're encouraged that they would like to move forward with legalization in the state but we're very interested in seeing the full details,"" said Melissa Moore, New York deputy director of the Drug Policy Alliance.

Legal marijuana opponents accused Cuomo's administration of acting on politics, noting Cynthia Nixon — the Sex and the City star challenging Cuomo from the left in a Democratic primary — supports legalizing the drug.

Cuomo's GOP opponent Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, knocked Zucker's announcement — as did other opponents.

""I think Andrew Cuomo is a political creature and everything he does should be viewed through the lens of politics,"" said Jason McGuire, executive director of Spencerport-based conservative group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms.

ALBANY - Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration is almost finished with a study on recreational marijuana that many expect could clear the way for the Democrat to back legalizing the drug.

Cuomo, however, has long been more cautious on marijuana than many within his party, reiterating his opposition to recreational marijuana as recently as last year, when he called it a gateway drug.

More: New York keeps inching closer to marijuana legalization

Here's a look at Cuomo's history with marijuana policy and how his positions have changed over the years.

August 2002: Admits to marijuana use

During his first, ill-fated run for governor, Cuomo says he ""tried marijuana in my youth."" He later reiterated this when he was asked about any past drug use during his second run for governor in 2010.

October 2010: Opposed to medical marijuana

A week before his election as governor, Cuomo comes out against medical marijuana. ""The dangers of medical marijuana outweigh the benefits,"" he said.

July 2011: 'Reviewing' medical marijuana

Cuomo tells reporters he’s studying the issue of medical marijuana. “We’re talking to both sides of the issue, if you will, and we’re reviewing it, but we don’t have a final position,"" he said.

April 2012: Re-iterates opposition

“I understand the benefits, but there are also risks and I think the risks outweigh the benefits at this point,"" Cuomo said.

June 2012: Push for lesser marijuana penalties

Cuomo proposes reducing the penalty for public possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana.

“If you possess marijuana privately, it’s a violation,"" he said. ""If you show it in public, it’s a crime. It’s incongruous.” Senate Republicans ultimately block the proposal.

April 2013: Still opposed to medical marijuana

“We’re looking at it, but at this point I don’t support medical marijuana,"" he said.

December 2013: No to recreational marijuana

A Democratic senator proposes a bill to legalize recreational marijuana, but a Cuomo spokesman calls it a “non-starter.”`

January 2014: Support for medical marijuana

Cuomo reverses his medical marijuana position, pledging to launch a program that would make the drug available on a very limited basis at up to 20 hospitals. “I feel comfortable with this approach,"" he said.

Buy Photo Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs a ceremonial bill to establish a medical marijuana program in New York in 2014. (Photo: AP file photo)

June 2014: Broader medical marijuana program approved

Lawmakers approve a bill creating a broader medical-marijuana program in New York. On Cuomo’s insistence, it included a number of strict restrictions, including a ban on smokeable forms of the drug and limits on the number of dispensaries. He signs the bill.

February 2017: Calls marijuana a 'gateway drug'

Cuomo reiterates opposition to legalizing recreational marijuana.

“As of this date, I am unconvinced on recreational marijuana,"" he said. ""If you choose to use marijuana recreationally, you know the law.” Calls marijuana a “gateway drug.”

January 2018: Launches legal marijuana study

Cuomo launches a study of whether it’s plausible to legalize marijuana for recreational use in New York, noting neighboring states Massachusetts and Vermont have done so.

“It is a hotly debated topic, pardon the pun, and it would be nice to have some facts in the middle of the debate,"" he said.

April 3, 2018: Study promised 'by the fall'

Department of Health spokeswoman says the agency will “collect the relevant information by the fall, at which point it will be reviewed and a report will be prepared.”

April 11, 2018: Nixon calls for legal marijuana

Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo’s Democratic opponent, calls for legalizing recreational marijuana.

May 14, 2018: New timeline for marijuana study

Cuomo says the marijuana study will be completed “within days” — not the fall, as the Health Department had previously said.

May 23, 2018: NY Democratic Party backs legal marijuana

Delegates at the state Democratic Party's designating convention back the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. The resolution comes the same day Cuomo, who leads the state party, was nominated by party delegates for a third term.

July 13, 2018: Health Department backs recreational marijuana

The state Department of Health issued its long-awaited report concluding the benefits outweigh the potential negative impacts of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The report is delivered to Cuomo, who says he will soon review it.

ALBANY — New York could take in up to $678 million in tax revenue in a year if it legalizes marijuana for recreational use, according to a long-awaited report issued Friday by the state Department of Health.

The state Health Department's 74-page report officially backed the legalization of marijuana, concluding that the ""positive effects"" outweigh the ""potential negative effects.""

That conclusion was anti-climactic: Health Commissioner Howard Zucker had previously said the report would support legalization.

But the full report, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered in January, analyzed an array of economic, social and criminal-justice issues associated with the drug, estimating the state could see anywhere from $248 million to $678 million added to its coffers in the first year depending on the price of the drug and the rate it's taxed.

""The positive effects of a regulated marijuana market in NYS outweigh the potential negative impacts,"" the report reads. ""Areas that may be a cause for concern can be mitigated with regulation and proper use of public education that is tailored to address key populations.""

Reasons for legalization

The report laid out dozens of reasons the state should legalize the drug, saying it could cut down on the disproportionate arrests of black and Hispanic users and allow the state to control the licensing and regulating of the industry.

It used tax rates of 7 percent and 15 percent to come up with its revenue estimates.

New York currently allows marijuana for medical use, though it's program is one of the most restrictive in the country, prohibiting users from taking the drug in smokeable forms.

The report is the latest in a quick evolution for Cuomo, who has long been wary of marijuana legalization, calling it a ""gateway drug"" as recently as last year.

But he has signaled he's more open to legalizing the use of recreational marijuana in recent months, ordering the Health Department to undergo the study as part of his State of the State address last January.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning in Brooklyn, Cuomo said he had not yet read the report.

“The report has come back,"" Cuomo said. ""I have not gone through it. I’m going to be briefed on it this afternoon by Dr. Zucker.”

Lawmakers must act

The state Legislature would have to approve any law legalizing marijuana for recreational use in New York.

Lawmakers are not scheduled to return to the state Capitol until January.

All 213 legislators are set to be up for election in November, which will decide whether Democrats or Republicans control the narrowly divided Senate — a balance of power that could have a significant impact on whether a marijuana-legalization bill gets a vote next year.

The report was applauded by the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that has long called for marijuana legalization.

In a statement, Chris Alexander, the group's policy coordinator, said any law legalizing the drug should include broad measures to clear the records of those who have been convicted under the state's current marijuana laws.

“Now that the report has been released and its conclusions presented, we are hopeful that the governor and the Legislature can shift from the ‘if’ to examining the ‘how’ to legalize marijuana,"" Alexander said in a statement.

After Cuomo launched the report in January, it was initially expected to be completed sometime before the end of the year.

That changed two months ago, when Cuomo said the report was coming within days.

Last month, Zucker said the report would conclude the pros of legalization outweighed the cons, saying the full document would be released ""soon.""

The report was ultimately released Friday, a day after Alain Kaloyeros, the former SUNY Polytechnic Institute president who led some of Cuomo's top economic-development projects, was convicted of fraud in a bid-rigging case.

Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo's Democratic primary opponent, issued a statement suggesting the report was meant to distract from the conviction.

Cuomo said that wasn't the case.

“Skepticism is one thing,"" the governor said. ""Paranoia is something else. This report was supposed to be done two weeks ago.""

What would legalized recreational marijuana mean to New Yorkers?

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that he wants a study to answer that question — and not just for the adults 21 and older who choose to use. Enacting the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act or a variation would change laws regulating many aspects of life in New York.

Here are some questions that await the results of the governor’s commission:

What could the buying experience be like?

Mary Jane Kruger lived in Oregon, where recreational marijuana has been legal for personal possession since 2015 and commercially since 2016.

The product could be bought only in licensed stores and could not be consumed in public. “I couldn’t walk down the street and smoke a joint,” said Kruger, who is back in Rochester and an organizer with Roc NORML, a new chapter of the marijuana advocacy organization.

She said products were labeled and store staff advised customers as a sommelier guides someone buying wine. “They gave me some direction for me to make my own responsible decision as an adult. … They’re not trying to get you as high as they can.”

How much money could the state make?

Buy Photo A medical cannabis dark chocolate bar purchased in a dispensary open to the public in Nevada has a warning label to keep out of the reach of children. (Photo: Dick Moss./staff photographer)

Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Colorado Department of Revenue reported marijuana taxes, licenses and fees for medical and recreational products generated total revenue of about $247.3 million for the calendar year 2017. Retail sales began in February 2014, and the revenue from that year was about $67.5 million.

From January 2014 through June 30, 2017, the Colorado retail marijuana sales tax rate was 10 percent. The state took 85 percent and local governments got 15 percent. Starting last July 1, the sales tax went up to 15 percent, with the state taking 90 percent of the total collected.

For some sense of comparison, New York had about $275.4 million in state and local alcoholic beverage tax revenue in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute & Brookings Institution.

Former Erie County Executive Joel Giambra, vying for the Republican nomination for governor, said legalizing marijuana and using the revenue is a more appropriate way than raising taxes to solve some fiscal problems like the state's crumbling infrastructure. Giambra made his comments Monday, the day before Cuomo's budget announcement.

Is there a hidden cost?

Carl Hatch-Feir, president and chief executive officer of Delphi Drug and Alcohol Council, said he’s heard arguments that marijuana is a revenue stream and also that it leads to accidents and other problems. Hatch-Feir said he didn’t have enough information to know whether legalization was an overall win or loss. He said the decision about legalization has to be based on scientific evidence from the federal Food and Drug Administration or a state agency using the same scientific process.

What does this mean for DWI laws?

Trooper Mark O’Donnell, spokesman for New York State Police Troop E, said law enforcement will wait for the law to be enacted before answering specific questions. But he compared marijuana to alcohol.

“If you can legally possess it and you’re taking it and you’re driving, you can be arrested for driving with ability impaired by drugs,” he said. “Just like alcohol is legal to drink it, but you can’t drink and drive.”

What’s the effect of recreational marijuana at work?

“The experience in other states, to my knowledge, has not been as big an impact as some have anticipated,” said Paul Keneally, a partner with Underberg & Kessler in Rochester and chairman of its labor and employment law practice group. “Hopefully, in many cases employees who are choosing to use recreational marijuana are doing it in a responsible fashion.”

Keneally said that because of marijuana’s past, some employers may be reluctant to see it on a par with alcohol. “If an employee is using marijuana on a Saturday and reports to work Monday sober, that’s the same as if the employee was using alcohol on Saturday and reported to work sober.”

He said the opposite also applies — it’s not acceptable for an employee to show up with signs of marijuana use or alcohol use.

Can you get a secondhand high?

“The easy answer is probably not,” said Melinda Lull, who holds a doctorate in pharmacology and is an associate professor in the Wegmans School of Pharmacy at St. John Fisher College. “The only way that someone would get that contact high would be if somebody was directly blowing smoke in their face at high levels.”

But there are issues of secondhand smoke. “Some of the compounds that are produced when tobacco burns are similar to those things that can be produced when marijuana burns. Things like carcinogens that are in tobacco smoke, some of those things can be in marijuana smoke, too.”

Are marijuana and alcohol equally addictive?

Lull said scientists are finding that marijuana activates the reward centers in the brain and can be addictive. She said legalization doesn’t make marijuana a benign substance and the discussion about marijuana has to include the same regulatory issues as alcohol.

Would the existing medical marijuana dispensaries sell recreational products?

That's how it works in some places, but it's not known whether New York would allow that.

Columbia Care manufactures medical marijuana and has a dispensary at Eastman Business Park. Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Vita sent this statement: “Columbia Care is committed to offering patients in Rochester and across the Empire State a natural treatment option through our portfolio of medical marijuana derived products that are safe, consistent and manufactured to stringent quality standards set by the New York Department of Health. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering New Yorkers the first-class, expert medical products and services they deserve.”

A spokesman for Fiorello Pharmaceuticals, which is scheduled to open a dispensary in the first quarter of this year, declined to comment.

What are the laws in neighboring states that are influencing New York?

The federal government classifies the THC in marijuana the same as it does heroin, and it’s illegal to bring marijuana across state lines.

Vermont’s Senate approved a recreational marijuana bill earlier this month, making it the first state to use the legislative process to legalize the drug. Other states have put it to a public vote. Vermont law would allow adults 21 and older up to 1 ounce of marijuana and two mature plants or four immature plants. The law does not include mechanisms for taxing and regulating production and sale, according to the Associated Press.

In Massachusetts, adults 21 and older can have up to 1 ounce outside their residence and up to 10 ounces inside their residence. Adults would not be able to buy marijuana until a recreational dispensary opens, which could be as earlier as June.

The province of Ontario in Canada could legalize recreational marijuana by July for adults 19 and older.

Pennsylvania and Ohio allow medical marijuana.

Washington, Oregon, California and Nevada are among states where consumers can buy recreational marijuana.

""The positive effects of a regulated marijuana market in New York state outweigh the potential negative impacts,"" says the report which was submitted to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

New York legalized medical marijuana two years ago.

New York is bordered by states -- Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey -- that have legalized recreational marijuana or are considering doing so. The state also shares a border with Canada which will legalize marijuana for pleasure in October.

The report says if New York does not legalize the drug, residents may start crossing state lines to buy marijuana, which could lead to an increase in marijuana possession arrests in border counties and a big loss of potential tax revenue.

The report estimates legalizing recreational pot could produce up to $340.6 million in tax revenue in the first year.

But the report says legalizing marijuana could come with tradeoffs.

""It is imperative that a regulated marijuana program contain all necessary safeguards and measures to limit access for individuals under 21, minimize impaired driving, provide education and tailored messaging to different populations and connect people to treatment if needed,"" the report says.

Here are some of the reports other findings:

Legalizing marijuana may reduce opioid overdose deaths.

Most evidence suggests legalizing pot has no or minimal impact on use by youth.

Estimates show anywhere from 8.9 percent to 30 percent of people who use marijuana develop a dependence on the drug.

Criminalization of marijuana has not curbed marijuana use and has resulted in higher rates of arrests of black people for possession.

217,218,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2018/07/post_59.html,NY urges banks to start doing business with marijuana industry,"ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York wants state-chartered banks and credit unions to start providing services to medical marijuana businesses which operate on a cash-only basis because banks are afraid to get involved in the pot industry.

Medical marijuana businesses are forced to pay their employees and taxes with wads of cash, according to memo released today by the state Department of Financial Services.

These cash-only businesses, their employees and customers are in danger of becoming targets of criminals, according to the memo.

Banks are reluctant to do business with medical marijuana providers because marijuana is considered illegal by the federal government which regulates banks.

The department said it will not take any regulatory action against state chartered banks or credit unions that provide services to marijuana businesses as long as they follow federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network guidelines issued in 2014.

Early this year U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws.

But the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network guidelines are still in effect. Those guidelines require banks to make sure medical marijuana businesses are licensed before establishing banking relationships with them.

""We're cutting the red tape and removing regulatory barriers to support businesses in the legal cannabis industry,"" Lieutenant Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared statement. ""Today's action to encourage banking relationships will go a long way to assist this emerging sector of our economy.""

Medical marijuana became available in New York in 2016.

New York's push to get banks doing business with the pot industry comes at a time when the state is considering legalizing recreational marijuana.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government had hoped to make pot legal by July 1, but the government has said provincial and territorial governments will need eight to 12 weeks following Senate passage and royal assent to prepare for retail sales. Trudeau's government is expected to decide a date that would legalize it in early or mid-September.

""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana -- and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,"" Trudeau tweeted.

Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade.

The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 52-29.

""We have seen in the Senate tonight a historic vote that ends 90 years of prohibition of cannabis in this country, 90 years of needless criminalization, 90 years of a just-say-no approach to drugs that hasn't worked,"" said independent Sen. Tony Dean, who sponsored the bill in the upper house.

Canada is the largest developed country to end a nationwide prohibition on marijuana use. In the neighboring U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States' biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan.

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould tweeted that it was a ""historic milestone for progressive policy in Canada as we shift our approach to cannabis""

Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor tweeted she was thrilled that the Senate approved the bill. ""We're on the cusp of a sensible, responsible and equitable cannabis policy,"" she said.

The Canadian government largely followed the advice of a marijuana task force headed by former Liberal Health Minister Anne McLellan as well as the advice of former Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, who is the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister.

The task force recommended adults be allowed to carry up to 30 grams of pot and grow up to four plants. It also said marijuana should not be sold in the same location as alcohol or tobacco.

The most controversial aspect of Canada's move to legalize marijuana nationwide has been setting the minimum age for use at 18 or 19, depending on the province. That is lower than in U.S. states that have embraced legalization.

Advocates argued that putting the limit at 21 would encourage a black market and drive youths into the hands of criminals. But some health experts have worried that the lower age will encourage use of a substance that can have long-term consequences on still-maturing brains.

Conservative senators remained staunchly opposed to legalization.

""We're going to have all those involved in illegal marijuana peddling right now becoming large corporation,"" Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos said. ""When you normalize the use of marijuana and you're a young person and you had certain reservations because of the simple fact that it was illegal, there's, I believe, a propensity to have somebody be more inclined to use it."""

The reduction in ""spike"" abuse is among many reasons health department researchers said the benefits of legalizing marijuana in New York outweigh the costs, according to a study published last week.

The study was published just as Syracuse was enduring an uptick in overdoses of synthetic marijuana.

At least 50 people were sent to emergency rooms after consuming the drug, which often made users pass out or behave erratically. The overdoses tended to be concentrated downtown and near the Rescue Mission, but some were also in other areas of the county.

The study's authors said a legal marijuana policy should aim not only to reduce the consumption of black-market marijuana but also be aimed at ""ultimately eliminating"" the synthetic marijuana market.

""A regulated marijuana program should include among its goals reducing the use of synthetic cannabinoids... and ultimately eliminating the synthetic cannabinoid market,"" the authors wrote.

The authors said some people take synthetic marijuana out of concern for failing urinalysis tests required by employers or probation offices. Synthetic drugs often do not show up on commonly used drug tests.

""There is disagreement between some experts about the effect legalization will have on synthetic cannabinoid use. However, it is clear that it is often chosen to avoid detection in urine testing,"" the authors wrote. ""One survey found that most users prefer natural cannabis.""

They also cited a study that showed countries with legal marijuana had lower usage rates of synthetic marijuana. And the authors said attracting people to actual marijuana instead of ""spike"" could be particularly helpful for those with severe mental illnesses.

However, the proposed cost of legal marijuana cited in the study is many times higher than synthetic marijuana. The local price of ""spike"" is about $10 for five grams, according to court documents and interviews with ""spike"" users during the recent overdose uptick.

Researchers estimated that, if legalized, marijuana would be sold here for between $294 and $374 an ounce, which does not include taxes of up to 15 percent and local sales taxes.

All told, an ounce of high-grade legal marijuana could sell up to $447, accounting for a 15 percent sales tax and a 4 percent sales tax. However, legal marijuana producers might not pass the tax on to consumers as they compete with the black market.

An ounce of marijuana sells on the streets for $270 to $340 in New York state, according to the study, which cited a crowd-sourced database of black-market prices.

According to court documents and ""spike"" users, an ounce of ""spike"" would cost about $56.

Users here can buy a rolling paper stuffed with ""spike"" for $1 or $2 and can buy a five-gram bag for $10.

The study does not address how a legal marijuana policy could deal with the price difference.

Johanne Morne, director of the AIDS Institute who was involved in the marijuana report, said the report's proposed marijuana prices are just estimates that could change if the policy is implemented.

And she said having a regulated marijuana market could help public health officials deal with people who use ""spike"" in other ways, like allowing for better education for users and linking them with services for their other needs.

""When we talk about the elimination of the black market, we want to protect users who may be using synthetic marijuana,"" she said. ""The opportunity that we have is to create a safer space for people ... from a harm-reduction perspective.""

She also said a market that sets pot prices too high and prevents people from buying marijuana wouldn't help anyone, so officials will do what they can to keep costs low for both marijuana smokers and ""spike"" users.

""We can't create a scenario where individuals are not able to access the product, so all of that has to be taken into account,"" she said in an interview with Syracuse.com | The Post-Standard.

The full study estimates legalizing recreational pot could produce up to $340.6 million in tax revenue in the first year. But legalization has some drawbacks that policymakers should try to address through education, cracking down on impaired driving and making sure those under age 21 have limited access to the drug, authors said."

The state Health Department said it has filed emergency regulations that make any condition for which opioids are prescribed a qualifying condition for medical marijuana.

While chronic pain is considered a qualifying condition for medical marijuana, severe pain is not. The change means people prescribed opioids for severe pain can now replace those drugs with medical marijuana.

The regulation also allows people being treated for opioid addictions to use medical marijuana as a replacement.

""Medical marijuana has been shown to be an effective treatment for pain that may also reduce the chance of opioid dependence,"" Dr. Howard Zucker, the state's health commissioner, said in a prepared statement.

Opioid replacement joins 12 conditions that qualify people in New York for medical marijuana. Those conditions include: cancer, HIV or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain.

There are more than 62,000 patients in New York certified to use medical marijuana and 1,735 providers registered to prescribe it.

The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood. But it's not quite medical marijuana.

The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant -- but not the one that gets users high. It's not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.

British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.

FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.

The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.

Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn't contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.

Physicians say it's important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.

""I'm really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,"" said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. ""In the artisanal products there's often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.""

Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.

Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.

""I preferred this to some of those other options because it's is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,"" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.

Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer ""drop"" seizures -- in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.

CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.

The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with ""uncertain dosages and formulations.""

""We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,"" Gottlieb said in a statement.

The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.

Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.

Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.

""I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,"" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation's largest CBD companies. ""I really don't think it's going to affect us much.""

Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.

A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.

For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.

The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.

The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.

Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.

Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.

Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.

GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances."
222,223,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2018/07/spike.html,At least 50 people in Syracuse have overdosed on synthetic pot,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- AMR ambulance crews have responded to at least 50 overdoses in the city involving the drug ""spike"" since Saturday, according to an official with the ambulance company.

Nick Corbishley, an AMR supervisor, said the overdoses have occurred downtown and on the Near West Side and South Side.

Ambulance crews don't know where the people overdosing are getting the drug.

""All we know is it's easy to get,"" he said.

Spike, also often referred to as ""Spice"" or synthetic marijuana, is a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with chemicals with similarities to THC, the mind-altering ingredient found in marijuana. The chemical makeup of the drug varies from brand to brand.

The drug is extremely dangerous and potentially deadly, according to the Upstate New York Poison Center.

Some of the people overdosing are relaxed, while others are so aggressive they have to be physically restrained or given sedatives, Corbishley said.

He said the rash of overdoses seems to be slowing down. As of 9 a.m. today AMR had responded to two overdoses. By 9 a.m. Wednesday it had already handled 10 cases.

Crouse Hospital's emergency room has seen 19 spike overdoses since Tuesday, seven of them since 3 a.m. today, according to Bob Allen, a Crouse vice president.

Upstate University Hospital's ER has been seeing five to 10 cases a day, said Kathleen Paice Froio, a hospital spokeswoman.

The Onondaga County Health Department has not responded to requests for information about the overdose outbreak.

Syracuse sees rash of synthetic pot overdoses; 'New shipment arrived yesterday'"
223,224,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2017/05/new_york_reveals_names_of_medical_marijuana_doctors.html,New York reveals names of medical marijuana doctors,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- New York has published a partial list of doctors and other providers registered to prescribe medical marijuana, information the state had been keeping under wraps.

The list includes 22 Central New York providers -- doctors, nurse practitioners and physican assistants, most of them in Onondaga County.

The list only includes providers who have agreed to be publicly identified. The state health department said it is prohibited from identifying medical marijuana providers without their consent.

Nearly 1,000 providers statewide are registered to certify patients for medical marijuana, but only 32 percent are included on the public list.

Finding participating doctors has been a hassle for many patients, who've been forced to make cold calls to doctors' practices to find medical marijuana prescribers. The state said the new list will make it easier for eligible patients to access medical marijuana.

Patients must be certified by a provider before they can buy medical marijuana from a dispensary.

The state expanded the medical marijuana program in March by adding chronic pain to the list of medical conditions that qualify patients for medical marijuana.

Since then an additional 3,356 patients have been approved for medical marijuana, bringing the state's total number of certified patients to 18,348.

The other qualifying conditions include cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy and Huntington's disease. Patients also must have one or more of these complications: wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, seizures, or severe or persistent muscle spasms.

Medical marijuana is only available in New York in oral capsules or liquid forms that can be vaporized and inhaled or taken orally. Smokable marijuana is not permitted.

Health insurance does not cover medical marijuana.

In a series of rushed announcements Thursday, authorities said that police would no longer conduct sting operations targeting low-level marijuana sales, and charges against 47 people arrested in the first five months of 2018 would be dismissed.

The extraordinary turnaround came after Hennepin County’s chief public defender contacted Mayor Jacob Frey to complain about what looked like blatant racial profiling. Frey then directed Chief Medaria Arradondo to stop the stings.

“I believe strongly that marijuana should be a lowest-level enforcement priority and that it should be fully legalized at the state level,” Frey said in a statement Thursday.

“The fact that racial disparities are so common nationwide in the enforcement of marijuana laws is one of the reasons I support full legalization.”

Thursday’s announcement by the chief signals a shift toward a more lenient approach pursued in other major U.S. cities. Drug-related arrests by Minneapolis police have already fallen nearly two thirds from 2007 to 2016, police records show.

But in recent years, Minneapolis police have stepped up their presence on Hennepin Avenue in response to concerns about safety downtown. Using undercover officers posing as buyers, they arrested 47 people for selling marijuana on Hennepin between 5th and 6th streets.

The Hennepin County Public Defender’s office determined that 46 of those arrested were black. All were charged as felonies. Some were put in diversion programs, some were convicted and at least one man went to prison.

“Almost all of those cases involve a sale of 1-2 grams of marijuana for a total of $10-$20,” assistant county public defender Jess Braverman wrote in a May 31 court document.

Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty said she called Frey last week about the racial disparities, and she said the mayor pledged to have them halted.

“Approaching black men and women who are low income and homeless and then having the county attorney charge them with felony drug sales makes me very angry and disappointed,” Moriarty said in an interview Thursday.

Arradondo announced Thursday in a 12:30 p.m. news conference that he had discontinued stings targeting low-level marijuana sales at the request of Frey. “While the intention was good, it had an unintended consequence,” he said.

He said that during the downtown police effort, officers arrested other people who were in possession of illegal guns and other drugs such as opioids, although that was separate from the marijuana arrests.

Arradondo defended his officers, saying they were acting professionally and not targeting black people because of their race. A police spokesman said that while the undercover stings were being stopped, police would still make arrests for marijuana sales.

At 3 p.m., Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman issued a news release that said he had informed Arradondo that he would not charge any more people arrested in the stings and that he was reviewing the remaining cases.

An hour later, his office notified Moriarty that all the cases were being dismissed.

“These undercover drug stings by the Minneapolis Police Department occurred without our knowledge,” Freeman said in a statement. “Because they occurred over a period of months and were distributed to about a half-dozen of our attorneys for prosecution, we did not detect any pattern.”

Though his office was alerted about the problem earlier, Freeman said he only learned about the situation Tuesday and “took immediate steps.” He said he told Arradondo he “would not be charging these types of cases” and began an immediate review of the remaining cases brought to his office’s attention.

Besides getting the cases dismissed, Moriarty pressed Freeman’s office to free one person who had been imprisoned, whom she did not identify, and asked the county attorney’s office to join her office in a motion to expunge the arrests from her clients’ records.

Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for Freeman, said the county attorney’s office was focused on dismissing the cases and had not considered the issue of expungement. He said that the case of the person imprisoned as a result of the sting is being reviewed.

In a court document, Braverman wrote that the arrests “have resulted in felony convictions for numerous black defendants who had been targeted, and all the devastating collateral consequences that go along with such convictions: jail time, prison time, and even deportation proceedings.”

Details about the stings were described in a case involving the arrest of one suspect, Shauntez Palmer, who was charged with fifth degree sale of 1.6 grams of marijuana.

An undercover officer stated in her report that she purchased marijuana from another person, Ameir Davis on Hennepin Avenue between N. 5th Street and N. 6th Street, while Palmer acted as a lookout.

Both men were arrested and brought to jail.

The department’s First Precinct in conjunction with other precincts and the Metro Transit police sent undercover officers to that block on Jan. 24, Feb. 13, Feb. 28, March 15, April 11 and May 24, resulting in 47 arrests.

“On the dates of the stings, officers are approaching people of color, individuals and groups, and asking to buy drugs,” Braverman wrote. “Officers have directly asked black men to facilitate drug deals with other black men, and have then requested that the facilitator be charged with sale. They are submitting the cases for felony charges.”

Moriarty said that the only white person arrested was not approached by police, but had himself approached an undercover officer about selling some marijuana.

In a letter to Arradondo on May 29, Moriarty wrote, “A review of the cases received by our office strongly suggests a trend of racial profiling under the guise of a ‘livability’ detail.”

Mel Reeves, a human rights activist who lives in Minneapolis, said he was cheered by the decision to halt the stings. “It’s not news that black people are targeted by law enforcement on marijuana charges,” he said. “It’s good news they are recognizing the disparities and doing something about it.”

As a council member, Frey championed an ordinance that brought city penalties for small-scale marijuana possession in line with state law, reducing the crime from a misdemeanor to petty misdemeanor.

Frey said in his statement that while he supports the legalization of marijuana, it “does not negate the need for our officers to make the necessary arrests to get guns off our streets and end the sale of life-threatening narcotic drugs like heroin.”

225,226,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/easy-entry-into-oregon-s-legal-pot-market-means-huge-surplus/484134761/,"Glut of marijuana in Oregon is cautionary tale, experts say","PORTLAND, Ore. — When Oregon lawmakers created the state's legal marijuana program, they had one goal in mind above all else: to convince illicit pot growers to leave the black market.

That meant low barriers for entering the industry that also targeted long-standing medical marijuana growers, whose product is not taxed. As a result, weed production boomed — with a bitter consequence.

Now, marijuana prices here are in freefall, and the craft cannabis farmers who put Oregon on the map decades before broad legalization say they are in peril of losing their now-legal businesses as the market adjusts.

Oregon regulators on Wednesday announced they will stop processing new applications for marijuana licenses in two weeks to address a severe backlog and ask state lawmakers to take up the issue next year.

Experts say the dizzying evolution of Oregon's marijuana industry may well be a cautionary tale for California, where a similar regulatory structure could mean an oversupply on a much larger scale.

""For the way the program is set up, the state (California) just wants to get as many people in as possible, and they make no bones about it,"" said Hilary Bricken, a Los Angeles-based attorney specializing in marijuana business law. ""Most of these companies will fail as a result of oversaturation.""

Oregon has nearly 1 million pounds (453,600 kilograms) of marijuana flower — commonly called bud — in its inventory, a staggering amount for a state with about 4 million people. Producers told The Associated Press wholesale prices fell more than 50 percent in the past year; a study by the state's Office of Economic Analysis found the retail cost of a gram of marijuana fell from $14 in 2015 to $7 in 2017.

The oversupply can be traced largely to state lawmakers' and regulators' earliest decisions to shape the industry.

They were acutely aware of Oregon's entrenched history of providing top-drawer pot to the black market nationwide, as well as a concentration of small farmers who had years of cultivation experience in the legal, but largely unregulated, medical pot program.

Getting those growers into the system was critical if a legitimate industry was to flourish, said Sen. Ginny Burdick, a Portland Democrat who co-chaired a committee created to implement the voter-approved legalization measure.

Lawmakers decided not to cap licenses; to allow businesses to apply for multiple licenses; and to implement relatively inexpensive licensing fees.

Oregon's Liquor Control Commission announced Wednesday it will put aside applications for new licenses received after June 15 until a backlog of pending applications is cleared. The decision comes after U.S. Attorney Billy Williams challenged state officials to address the oversupply.

""In my view, and frankly in the view of those in the industry that I've heard from, it's a failing of the state for not stepping back and taking a look at where this industry is at following legalization,"" Williams told the AP in a phone interview.

But those in the industry supported the initial decisions that led to the oversupply, Burdick said.

""We really tried to focus on policies that would rein in the medical industry and snuff out the black market as much as possible,"" Burdick said.

Lawmakers also quickly backtracked on a rule requiring marijuana businesses have a majority ownership by someone with Oregon residency after entrepreneurs complained it was hard to secure startup money. That change opened the door to deep-pocketed, out-of-state companies that could begin consolidating the industry.

The state has granted 1,001 producer licenses and had another 950 in process as of last week. State officials worry if they cut off licensing or turn away those already in the application process, they'll get sued or encourage illegal trade.

Some of the same parameters are taking shape in California, equally known for black-market pot from its Emerald Triangle.

Rules now in effect there cap only certain, medium-sized growing licenses. In some cases, companies acquired dozens of growing licenses, which can be operated on the same or adjoining parcels. The California Growers Association, an advocacy group, is suing to block those rules, fearing they will open the way for vast farms that will drive out smaller cultivators.

Beau Whitney, senior economist at national cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data, said he's seeing California prices fall.

In contrast, Washington knew oversupply could draw federal attention and was more conservative about licensing. As the market matured, its regulators eased growing limits, but the state never experienced an oversupply crisis.

Colorado has no license caps, but strict rules designed to limit oversupply allow it to curtail a growers' farm size based on past crop yields, existing inventory, sales deals and other factors.

In Oregon, cannabis retail chains are emerging to take advantage of the shake-up.

A company called Nectar has 13 stores around the state — with three more on tap — and says on its website it is buying up for-sale dispensaries too. Canada-based Golden Leaf Holdings bought the successful Oregon startup Chalice and has six stores around Portland, with another slated to open.

William Simpson, Chalice's founder and Golden Leaf Holdings CEO, is expanding into Northern California, Nevada and Canada. Simpson welcomes criticism that his business is to cannabis what Starbucks is to mass-market coffee.

""If you take Chalice like Starbucks, it's a known quantity, it's a brand that people know and trust,"" he said.

Amy Margolis, the Oregon Cannabis Association's executive director, says capping licenses would only spur more consolidation in the long term. The state is working on a study that should provide data and insight into what lies ahead.

""I don't think that everything in this state is motivated by struggle and failure,"" she said. ""I'm very interested to see ... how this market settles itself and (in) being able to do that from a little less of a reactionary place.""

For now, Oregon's smaller marijuana businesses are trying to stay afloat.

A newly formed group will launch an ad campaign this fall to tell Oregonians why they should pay more for mom-and-pop cannabis. Oregon Craft Cannabis Alliance founder Adam Smith believes 70 percent of Oregon's small growers and retailers will go out of business if consumers don't respond.

""We could turn around in three to four years and realize that 10 to 12 major companies own a majority of the Oregon industry and that none of it is really based here anymore,"" he said. ""The Oregon brand is really all about authenticity. It's about people with their hands in the dirt, making something they love as well as they can. How do we save that?"""

Medical milestone: US OKs marijuana-based drug for seizures

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a strawberry-flavored syrup to treat severe seizures that begin in childhood

By MATTHEW PERRONE

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.

CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.

The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear.

FDA's Gottlieb warned about the use of CBD products with ""unproven medical claims.""

""The promotion and use of these unapproved products may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,"" Gottlieb said.

The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.

Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.

Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.

""I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,"" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group that supports access to CBD. ""I really don't think it's going to affect us much.""

Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.

A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.

For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.

The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few effective treatments. Patients experience frequent, severe seizures, in some cases more than 100 per day.

But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.

The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.

Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.

Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.

Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval. That decision is expected within 90 days.

GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances. European approval is expected in early 2019.

227,228,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/on-net-minneapolis-policy-change-on-marijuana-enforcement-harms-public-safety/485183371/,"On net, Minneapolis policy change on marijuana enforcement harms public safety","The Minneapolis Police Department is in a no-win situation with respect to enforcement of marijuana laws, and Mayor Jacob Frey’s decision to ask the department to stop enforcing laws against marijuana sales will have a deleterious effect on public safety in the city.

Criminalization of marijuana has not worked. Marijuana use is widespread: a Yahoo News/Marist college poll conducted in 2017 concluded that more than half of American adults have used marijuana and that 55 million Americans use marijuana at least once a year. A number of polls show that marijuana legalization is supported by more than half of Americans. It is also clear that the criminalization of marijuana has led to disproportionate levels of arrests of people of color. These arrests further strain the relationship between the police and the community they serve.

At first blush, Frey’s decision to ask the Police Department to stop enforcing low-level marijuana sales seems like a good one: Indeed, it will likely reduce negative interactions between the police and a community that often feels overpoliced; it will save the cost of processing prosecution and arrests of some people whose arrest and prosecution serves little purpose in increasing public safety overall; and it will potentially free police resources to address more serious crime. While all of those things are good, the net effect on public safety may actually be a negative one.

Marijuana is a popular product. The de facto decriminalization of marijuana — decreasing the likelihood of being arrested for its use or for the sale of small amounts of marijuana — makes it more popular. Because there is not currently a legal manner to bring this popular product to market, we have created a situation in which a highly lucrative commodity is often produced and always distributed by organizations that are, by necessity, criminal in nature. We have a long, sad history of violence in this country generated by criminal groups fighting for control of black markets. Decriminalization is likely to increase that violence by increasing the market demand and profit while still not providing a means for legal production and distribution.

It is perhaps too early to tell if legalization of marijuana, where the sale can be regulated and taxed appropriately, will reduce violent crime, but the earliest research seems to suggest it will. One study shows a decrease in violent crime in Mexican border states that have legalized recreational marijuana. Legalization of marijuana will not necessarily eliminate the black-market production, distribution and sale of the commodity, but evidence suggests that it will greatly reduce it — and it certainly creates a more compelling government interest in the enforcement against black-market sales and distribution.

There are, of course, other considerations to be weighed before legalizing marijuana. There is legitimate concern about whether legalization will have a negative effect on traffic safety by introducing more impaired drivers on the road. Early research indicates that (a) either more research is needed, or (b) there is not a significant difference between the amount of marijuana-impaired driving in states where marijuana is legal and those in which it is not. There is also legitimate concern about whether legalization of marijuana will increase use of marijuana among adolescents; like access to alcohol, cigarettes and prescription medication, education and prevention campaigns would be needed to address youth access to marijuana. What is clear, though, from numerous public health studies is that adult use of marijuana is not more harmful than cigarettes, alcohol or opiates, and is almost certainly less addictive than any of those legal substances.

If we are truly interested in public safety by reducing violent crime, decriminalization may be the worst policy alternative: It increases the market for marijuana by reducing the disincentives to use it without providing a legal means for production and distribution. The risk of violence among black-marketeers certainly remains and may increase. Legalization through controlled distribution is a far safer policy alternative.

228,229,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/canada-to-announce-marijuana-legalization-date-soon/486030901/,Trudeau: Canada to legalize marijuana on Oct. 17,"TORONTO — Marijuana will be legal nationwide in Canada starting Oct. 17 in a move that should take market share away from organized crime and protect the country's youth, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday.

The Senate gave final passage to the bill to legalize cannabis on Tuesday, legislation that will make Canada only the second country in the world to make pot legal across the country.

Trudeau said provincial and territorial governments need the time to prepare for retail sales.

""It is our hope as of October 17 there will be a smooth operation of retail cannabis outlets operated by the provinces with an online mail delivery system operated by the provinces that will ensure that this happens in an orderly fashion,"" Trudeau said.

The prime minister said at a news conference that the goal is to take a significant part of the market share away from organized crime.

""Over the following months and indeed years we will completely replace or almost completely replace the organized crime market on that,"" he said.

Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade.

""The legislation is transformative,"" said Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, adding it ""marks a wholesale shift in how our country approaches cannabis, leaving behind a failed model of prohibition.""

She urged Canadians to follow the existing law until the Cannabis Act comes into force.

""The law still remains the law,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

Many questions remain unanswered, including how police will test motorists suspected of driving under the influence, what to do about those with prior marijuana convictions and just how the rules governing home cultivation will work.

The Canadian provinces of Quebec and Manitoba have already decided to ban home-grown pot, even though the federal bill specifies that individuals can grow up to four plants per dwelling.

""Provinces can set their own laws. If individuals are challenging that law, they can challenge it,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

Trudeau said the government won't discuss pardons of past convictions until legalization is in effect.

""There's no point looking at pardons while the old law is in the books,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said they are going to treat it like wine and tobacco, noting that few people will cultivate it at home, but it's necessary to fight organized crime.

Trudeau promised to legalize it during the 2015 election and had set a goal of July 1 for it. The provinces pleaded for more time.

Canadian marijuana stocks have rallied in anticipation of legalization and jumped again on Wednesday.

In the neighboring U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States' biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan. 1.

The news was greeted with enthusiasm by marijuana advocates in the U.S.

Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the National Cannabis Industry Alliance in the U.S., said Canada's legalization should also serve as a wake-up call south of the border.

""The most important takeaway is that it's time for advocates in the industry to double down, so as to not be surpassed by the Canadian cannabis industry,"" he said.

Don Hartleben, who manages Dank of America, a retail cannabis store just south of the border in Blaine, Washington, said Canada's legalization was not only politically exciting, but a potential business boon for him.

Many of his customers are Canadian tourists who are terrified of trying to bring pot across the border, he said. If more use marijuana when they're in Canada, more will use when they're on vacation in the states.

""People ask me all the time, 'Isn't legalization in Canada going to hurt your business?'"" he said. ""I tell them, 'No! The more it's legal, the more people are going to feel safe to buy my product.'"""
229,230,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/walz-bill-sends-message-to-va-get-going-on-medical-marijuana-research/480310493/,Walz bill sends message to VA: Get going on medical marijuana research,"Two common but unseen wounds of war — chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder — are notoriously difficult to treat. Both can linger long after a return to the homefront, affecting a veteran’s ability to successfully readjust to life stateside.

With the deadly risks of frequently used pain relievers called opioids now exposed, it’s understandable that many veterans are turning to an alternative — medical marijuana. Despite legality that varies by state, an October 2017 survey by the American Legion found that nearly one in five veterans were “currently using cannabis to treat a medical condition” in lieu of opioids and were reporting better outcomes. It’s surprising the number isn’t higher given how many aging veterans or those returning from combat suffer from chronic pain — 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, compared with 30 percent of Americans.

These data from one of the nation’s best-known veterans service organizations offer a compelling look at how an old and sometimes demonized drug could ease the suffering of those who have served. But far more rigorous study — meaning research that involves doctor-led trials and rigorously measured outcomes — is necessary before marijuana fully earns its spot in the medication tool box that providers can tap to help wounded warriors.

That’s why Congress needs to act without delay in passing a new bipartisan bill championed by Reps. Phil Roe, a Tennessee Republican, and Tim Walz, a Minnesota Democrat who is running for governor. The duo’s “VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act,” announced this week, would clarify the authority that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has to research marijuana’s role in treating veterans. “When a veteran tells me they’re finding relief, I believe them,” Walz said in an interview this week.

The bill has the support of the American Legion. And having two influential authors should help speed it through Congress. Roe, a physician, chairs the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Walz, a veteran, is the committee’s highest-ranking Democrat. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is expected to champion it in the upper chamber. Tester is the ranking member of the Senate’s Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.

Still, it’s unfortunate that these lawmakers need to draw upon their connections and goodwill to shepherd this through. VA leadership should have embraced the opportunity to research marijuana’s potential benefits long ago instead of finding excuses not to do so.

One of these irresponsible foot-dragging episodes came to light late last year in an exchange of letters between Walz and former VA Secretary David Shulkin. Noting growing concerns about opioid risks, Walz and nine other House members called on the agency to wield its world-class research arm to study marijuana’s potential to treat veterans. Shulkin’s terse and tardy reply in December said federal law restricts the agency’s ability to do this — a conclusion a Brookings Institution expert called an “unfortunate combination of false information, incomplete analysis, and incomprehensible logic.”

Shulkin was fired in March after a travel expense scandal. It is unclear if President Donald Trump’s pick to replace him, Dr. Ronny Jackson, supports VA research on marijuana. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose outdated views on marijuana likely influenced Shulkin’s poor decision, will probably still hold considerable sway over the agency’s future research direction. Having the Roe-Walz legislation passed or in the pipeline counters Session’s antiquated notions. It also sends two strong messages to VA researchers — get going, and Congress has your back. All treatment avenues must be pursued to deliver the care veterans deserve."
230,231,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-marijuana-moment-why-to-legalize-by-someone-who-doesn-t-inhale/474346773/,"Minnesota's marijuana moment: Why to legalize, by someone who doesn't inhale","I don’t smoke marijuana. There are secret purchases required, plus the learning of code, dealer etiquette, dosing expertise, exotic strains, the latest artisanal delivery systems, and it all sounds way too complicated.

Also, because it’s easy to forget this detail, pot is illegal.

But even if pot were decriminalized tomorrow — a proposal on the table at the State Capitol — the chances of my racing out to score some “Chronicles of Narnia” and then heading home to roll up a fatty are, well, slim. Unlike Bill Clinton, the one time I did blaze up, over 20 years ago, I inhaled quite deeply enough to find the effect unpleasant. Some of us have all the feelings of alienation and existential weirdness you could ask for, thank you very much.

None of this is meant as a claim on virtue. My vice when the shop whistle blows comes by way of the less-healthy, socially acceptable pathway: that wrecker of livers, faces and families, the noble fermented beverage.

Point being, I don’t write any of the following out of the reason we tend to suspect a person calls for legalization — you know, because the writer is into weed.

It’s just that weed is already here, as if that really needed to be said, and has survived the ultimate multigenerational field test. Pot is ubiquitous in middle-class American life, or at least it was in mine. When I was growing up, my parents told us to stay away from drugs and people who take them, but the advice became tricky with pot. I smelled marijuana early and often, at parties, in the parks and at concerts back in the 1970s, mainstream shows filled with hypocrites now drawing salaries in the Twin Cities corporate economy.

Why anyone would be upset about a fellow Minnesotan lighting up is beyond me. As one of the everyday smells of life in the Midwest, I’ll take the scent of some guy’s one-hitter in Section 102 over that of lutefisk, manure-spreading or the Pine Bend refinery any day. My first record store, now that I think of it, was a clean, well-lit head shop. It sat a block from a Catholic church in the heart of south Minneapolis and offered up roach clips, rolling papers and long, welcoming cases of bongs, so-called paraphernalia that we blithely sauntered past on our way to the stacks of “Hotel California.”

Half of all Americans have tried pot, and more than 60 percent of Americans are in favor of making it legal for recreational use, according to the Pew Research Center. Eight states have done so — Colorado, California, Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Nevada — mainly independent-thinking places that share more in common with Minnesota than most states.

Though the Trump Justice Department recently rescinded an Obama-era policy that brought federal prosecutors in line with state laws concerning marijuana, the reversal is likely to have limited impact, given the way that it pits busy prosecutors against the will of statehouses. Recreational use also seems to have pushed the many unknowable assertions about the benefits of THC for medical use to the side — you don’t need clinical trials if you can buy it over the counter — and it comes at a time in which popular culture has mostly abandoned its dated anxieties about pot.

No one really finds the act of getting high all that interesting, for one thing. (Are you listening, Seth Rogen and James Franco?) The Cheech & Chong sketches and stoner jokes of eras past have quietly given way to depictions of “the banal normalcy of marijuana in American life today,” as the Washington Post recently described the rise of closely observed cable dramas dealing with pot, shows like “Weeds” on Showtime and “High Maintenance” on HBO. This seems to align with the life trajectory of pot use on view all around us, which is that there is no singular life trajectory of pot use, or at least no singular narrative that ends in addiction and ruin.

In college, I had a hallmate who was selling. I looked him up the other day to see what fresh hell his life had become, but it turns out he’s a family man who holds a midlevel post at one of the Fortune 500 firms in town. The guy who got me stoned back in the ’90s is now a doctor for one of the big health centers in Minneapolis.

These are only anecdotes, of course, and selling weed at a small liberal arts college is a far cry from selling in the neighborhoods, which has lately become a hazard. As the Star Tribune reported last week, dealing marijuana on the black market has become deadly in Minnesota, with 29 dealers having been killed over the last 11 years. Is that an argument against legalization or for it?

Because smoking marijuana appears to be relatively safe. According to the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Science, just 9 percent of adults who try marijuana become dependent, compared with 15 percent of those who try alcohol and 32 percent of those who try tobacco. So while pot may show up in lives that go off track, there have always been enough exceptions that it’s hard to say pot was causal. The decades of telling ourselves smoking pot destroys lives only delays our reckoning with the forces that do destroy lives. Pot is just a part of who we are, a culturally sanctioned form of lawlessness, a looking-the-other-way endorsed in some form by all of us.

• • •

And with that out of the way, consider now the strange privilege allowed to lawyers who depicted pot as synonymous with erratic behavior and aggression when it was helpful in acquitting Jeronimo Yanez, the St. Anthony police officer who killed Philando Castile. The facts of the 2016 shooting are largely not in dispute: At the time of the traffic stop, the school lunch worker had THC in his system and the presence of mind to volunteer that he was carrying a firearm (with a permit, but Yanez began shooting before Castile could provide the paperwork). Having been told to hand over his driver’s license and “just don’t reach for it, then” after mention of his firearm, Castile had been given conflicting instructions about what to do with his hands. He had also been pulled over nearly 50 times for minor offenses in his lifetime, presumably enough to have made the act of reaching for his wallet second nature.

And Castile never did reach for his weapon, at least if the testimony of an EMT is to be given priority. He said the gun was found deep in Castile’s front pocket. Thanks to the ambiguousness of blood THC levels, Castile’s degree of impairment, if any, was unknown.

And yet the pot got all the attention. A web search on the trial reads like a farrago of pot-shaming and deflection, a bad crime novel from the 1950s. Lawyers endorsed Yanez’s panic over the smell of weed. They lingered over 6 grams of pot in a jar located where any driver would keep it, under the seat and out of view. Lead defense attorney Earl Gray interrogated Castile’s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds on whether it was she or Castile who had bought this small pile of San Francisco Whatnot, then belabored small changes in her story on the chain of possession of this pot. He badgered her over the interaction of her foot with the dull stash, and circled back to malign her for her daily habit.

“How much of the $20,000,” Gray taunted Reynolds over the proceeds of a bleak GoFundMe windfall, “did you use on marijuana?” Castile “was spaced out,” Gray told the jurors. “He was staring straight ahead. He was stoned.”

Does it help us to live under law to condemn a motorist to his death for staring straight ahead? Is it possible that Castile was avoiding eye contact because that’s what a cooperative person would do to preserve dignity after a lifetime of harassment on the roadways? Though blacks use marijuana at the same rates as whites, they are six and a half times more likely to be arrested for possession in Minnesota, or twice the national average.

This disparity is hardly the only reason for decriminalization — but given the role it played in Castile’s death it seems reason enough. “The tragic results of that traffic stop,” as state Rep. Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, wrote last year on the website Medium, “bring into sharp focus the unfortunate legacy of decades of criminalizing possession and use of marijuana in Minnesota.”

Thissen was, until recently, one of five DFL candidates for governor advocating for legalization of recreational marijuana by adults (he dropped out of the race earlier this month). My legislator, Rep. Tina Liebling, was among the first in the state House to call for the change, terming prohibition a “failed policy” and pitching decriminalization as a pragmatic pathway to responsible regulation of drug potency and prevention of marijuana use among minors.

First District U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, St. Paul’s state Rep. Erin Murphy and former St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman (who also recently left the race) have taken similar positions, with Walz noting “the system we have had was that where we looked the other way, unless you’re a person of color.”

These are hardly the voices of the extreme left: Liebling’s district includes the Mayo Clinic, while Walz is an outstate moderate. Most would move to release all convicts in the state who are imprisoned for marijuana crimes and expunge the convictions from their records, according to a recent survey by Sensible Minnesota. All of these candidates are vying to replace Gov. Mark Dayton, whose opposition to legalization remains fixated on an outdated narrative of pot, as opposed to its illicit status, as threat to public safety. “We’ve got enough drugs,” Dayton has said, “an epidemic of drugs that’s floating through our society right now, and law enforcement’s got to deal with all the consequences of it.”

“It has no future whatsoever,” said former GOP Rep. Tony Cornish, who blocked the decriminalization bill from a hearing in his public-safety committee. Which is ironic, because it was the legislative career of Rep. Cornish that would turn out to have no future, albeit thanks to a separate social upheaval. (Cornish resigned following a sex-harassment claim last fall.)

Though on opposite sides of most other issues, Dayton and Cornish were working from a script with a blind spot for the dysfunction that criminalization introduces into law enforcement. The scent of “burnt marijuana” Yanez said caused him to fear for his life gives police a pretext to search a motorist’s car. Law enforcement receives hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from earnings seized through marijuana conviction asset forfeiture, revenue that cannot help but to distort priorities and casts their impartiality on the issue into question.

From a fiscal standpoint, Minnesota taxpayers absorbed the cost of 9,000 arrests in connection with pot in 2016, or 50 percent of all drug arrests that year. It is an enormous demand on public resources and police officer time.

And for what? Among the findings nested within a 2017 National Academies of Sciences review of the medical literature at large are findings that pot makes users less, rather than more, aggressive; that it does not appear to cause lung cancer; and that the evidence is not strong for the shopworn assertion that pot use leads to harder drugs. (Illegal pot puts buyers in touch with harder drugs.)

Pot does have its share of problems. Long-term use is known to produce bronchitis and social anxiety, and at high doses is associated with a population facing the elevated risk of schizophrenia. Smoking pot appears to be a bad idea during the critical period of development that is adolescence, though that is something legalization would arguably reduce. Taking the market away from criminals, as Sensible Minnesota executive director Maren Schroeder points out, protects children. “Drug dealers don’t check IDs.”

• • •

All of which is to say that the evidence for treating pot as public enemy No. 1 is mixed at best. And yet it’s easy to see why the idea of legalization makes people uncomfortable.

I have driven down the freeway in Colorado after that state made recreational use legal. I remember how unnerving it felt to gaze over at a kid of maybe 20, barreling down the road in a beater covered in grime, smoking from a pipe in the middle of the day. It was a bright and sunny afternoon, and it just felt, ahhh, no. There’s a time and a place for everything, right?

Anyone who has visited Amsterdam, for that matter, the world’s test project for the social experiment of decriminalizing marijuana while surrounded by jurisdictions that prohibit it, knows how a charmed locale can take on the feeling of too many visitors with productivity problems and a dysphoric outlook.

Which might be our preferred way of thinking about repealing the prohibition on recreational use of pot by adults going forward. That the time has come to take away this tool for the endangerment of motorists carrying weed and the consignment of marijuana workers to dangerous conditions on the street — but to remember, as we do so, that our sense of connection with one another will surely face new forms of stress. Of all the problems with pot that have been noted in the literature, those that seem to stand out have less to do with crime than with human potential.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, pot is capable of decreasing drive and ambition. Case studies (and personal experience) remind us that pot can leave users feeling more insightful and connected within relationships, while in fact having functioned as a barrier to self-awareness and as a tool for avoiding interpersonal challenges, allowing them to multiply.

But none of those are legal problems. You could call them ordinary human problems. And they certainly aren’t reason to bear witness to even one more death of a fellow human for the crime of being stoned.

The state Board of Health narrowly voted to prohibit the sale of smokable marijuana and require that dispensaries must have a pharmacist on staff. The board's own attorney advised against the additions, and the changes rankled medical marijuana proponents who accused the board of defying the will of the people.

""The people were clear. They wanted to be able to smoke medical marijuana,"" said former state Sen. Connie Johnson, a longtime advocate for legalized marijuana. ""This flies in the face of what the people wanted.""

Legal wrangling has gummed up the rollout of medical marijuana in several other states, including in neighboring Arkansas, where a proposal approved by voters in 2016 remains on hold because of a legal challenge. There were years of court fights in Michigan after voters there approved medical marijuana in 2008.

But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mary Fallin stepped aside after residents of traditionally conservative Oklahoma voted June 26 to legalize medical marijuana , paving the way for a quicker start. Nearly 57 percent of voters said yes to one of the least-restrictive laws in the country that makes it legal to grow, sell and use marijuana for medicinal purposes. The law, which made it to the ballot through signature petition, outlines no qualifying conditions, which would allow physicians to authorize its use for a broad range of ailments and gives a 60-day timeline to implement.

Implementation could face strong head winds, though, from opponents in the business, medical and law enforcement fields that pushed hard against the proposal. Groups representing doctors and hospitals, both of which opposed State Question 788, recommended the ban on selling smokable marijuana and the pharmacist requirement.

Health board member Charles Skilling, the CEO of a hospital in Shawnee who proposed the ban, said he did it out of concern for public health. Health advocates have pushed for so long against smoking cigarettes that it was hard for them to endorse smoking of any kind.

Oklahoma's interim commissioner of health said the agency is fully prepared to move forward with a regulatory framework for the new industry in the state, although he acknowledged legal challenges are likely.

""I have no reason to think it won't go smoothly and that the will of the people won't be adhered to,"" said Commissioner Tom Bates.

Chip Paul, who helped write the medical marijuana state question and push for its approval, said the board's last-minute changes were problematic, but he's optimistic the state is closer to helping patients.

""Even with a pharmacist on site, even with no smokable marijuana, we now have a program where patients who are suffering can at least get some relief, and that's a giant, huge deal,"" Paul said.

Bud Scott, an attorney who represents several marijuana businesses, called the board's actions ""an insult to our democratic institutions.""

""This is an attempt to kneecap the program,"" Scott said, ""not a good-faith effort to implement it safely.""

Scott has called for a special legislative session for lawmakers to set up a regulatory framework, and Fallin initially supported the idea. But the governor reversed course when lawmakers expressed little appetite to return to the Capitol to tinker with the new law just ahead of the November election.

Meanwhile, marijuana advocates are gathering signatures for a statewide vote on whether to fully legalize cannabis for recreational use in Oklahoma. Organizers say they've gathered about 84,000 signatures so far and need about 40,000 more by Aug. 8 to qualify for the November ballot.

Oklahoma's was the first marijuana question on a state ballot in 2018, with elections scheduled for later this year in Michigan and Utah."
232,233,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/marijuana-trafficking-on-the-rise-along-minnesota-north-dakota-interstate/475105773/,"Big pot busts spike along I-94, suggesting drug is coming from 'legal' states","The first hint of trouble came in November, when police pulled over a northern Minnesota woman suspected of speeding on Interstate 94 in West Fargo, N.D. While the car was stopped, a police K-9 named Disco hit on something more — packages containing 286 pounds of marijuana with a street value of more than $1.3 million.

A month later, a county sheriff’s deputy made a traffic stop of a minivan driven by a St. Paul man just east of Jamestown, N.D., and discovered nearly 200 pounds of pot.

Then came the stunner. In late January, a routine stop of a truck for a minor driving infraction along I-94 in eastern North Dakota turned out to be anything but. While searching the back of the vehicle, police found 476 pounds of marijuana worth more than $3 million.

The busts, surprising in their worth, have some authorities wondering whether the I-94 corridor that slices through the heart of both states and Wisconsin is becoming a major pipeline for marijuana and other drugs.

“That’s not the direction we want to go,” said Wisconsin State Patrol Lt. Chris Jushka. “We’re definitely seeing more drugs in the state.”

In 2017, Minnesota troopers seized more than 2,600 pounds of marijuana — more than six times what they found the year before. Across the border, North Dakota troopers confiscated 300 pounds in 2017, up 88 percent from 2016. One-third of North Dakota’s drug arrests were made along I-94, authorities say. And in Wisconsin, troopers saw a 20 percent increase in drug arrests, mostly marijuana-related, from 2016 to 2017.

To be sure, the trafficking shows little indication of slowing in 2018.

Several days after North Dakota authorities made the $3 million-plus bust, Minnesota state troopers pulled over a motorist along I-94 in Otter Tail County, and a drug-sniffing dog discovered 200 pounds of marijuana valued at more than $600,000.

Earlier this month, a trooper near Fergus Falls stopped a driver for an obstructed license plate and discovered a passenger sitting on 300 pounds of weed.

Law enforcement in all three states attribute the spike to the fact that marijuana has steadily gained social acceptance in the U.S. and has become partly legal in 29 states, with eight states making it legal for recreational use. In Minnesota, medical marijuana became legalized in 2014, but recreational use here and in North Dakota and Wisconsin remains illegal.

Authorities say they think more residents in the three states are buying marijuana where it’s legal, then bringing it back home to distribute.

“We’ve never had this situation with marijuana laws,” substance abuse expert Carol Falkowski said. “It’s reasonable we’re going to start seeing more of it here.”

North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Roark said troopers have made 82 marijuana-related arrests so far this year, often involving drivers passing through to other states.

Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matt Langer wasn’t available for comment last week but told the Star Tribune earlier this month that “we see drugs on every road, but we have seen large quantities in that area and we are paying attention to I-94.”

Brian Marquart, the state Department of Public Safety’s gang and drug coordinator, said authorities have seen a rise in marijuana trafficking across the state over the past several years — from 21,208 ounces confiscated in 2014 to 69,236 ounces in 2017.

“We’re seeing a dramatic increase in marijuana and marijuana concentrate coming from states like Colorado, California and Oregon,” Marquart said, adding that addiction to the drug is “compounded tremendously by public opinion and attitude that it’s not a dangerous substance.”

Slowing the trend

Along with the increase in the amount of marijuana seized of late, Marquart said authorities are also seeing an increase in violent crime.

The Star Tribune reported this month that at least seven Minnesotans died last year during marijuana transactions, the most in a decade.

In Wisconsin, weapons-related arrests increased in 2017 from the year before, as did arrests of drivers under the influence of drugs.

“They generally go together,” Jushka said of drugs, weapons and violence.

Troopers not only are finding more marijuana during traffic stops, he said, but also in the mail.

In an effort to crack down, the Wisconsin State Patrol plans to add another K-9 this week to its force of eight dogs that are trained to sniff out drugs during traffic stops. It also plans to ramp up trooper training.

Minnesota, meanwhile, is adding two dogs to its K-9 unit. It now has 16 dogs, the most it has had in several years. Its canine teams tracked down 2,642 pounds of marijuana in 2017, up from 389 pounds in 2016, according to the State Patrol.

But as with many crime trends, officers say they can’t combat the problem alone.

“It’s aggressive enforcement, but it has to be partnered with a strong prevention message,” Marquart said. “People say that marijuana is a safe substance. … It is very addictive. We just want people to stop dealing and stop using.”"

But state. Rep. Erin Murphy, Attorney General Lori Swanson and Congressman Tim Walz also have their differences. Some of those are subtle while others are more pronounced.

RELATED: Where the Republican candidates stand, differ

Here’s where they stand — and differ — on some of the biggest issues of this campaign season:

GUN CONTROL

Murphy, Swanson and Walz all say they support tightening gun regulations to keep Minnesotans safe in the wake of ongoing mass shootings in public places like schools, churches and office buildings.

That means requiring background checks for gun purchases, allowing law enforcement to obtain a court order to seize firearms from people deemed dangerous and studying the impact gun violence has on public health. They also all want better school security and improved access to mental health care.

Murphy, of St. Paul, also wants to ban what she calls “military-style weapons” such as the AR-15 rifle and similar guns that are commonly used in mass shootings. Murphy touts her dozen years receiving an “F” rating from the National Rifle Association.

“Minnesotans are demanding urgent action on this issue,” Murphy said. “It’s time to move the NRA out of this debate.”

Swanson, of Eagan, has downplayed her past NRA support, saying it was more about the organization’s opposition to her opponent in 2010 than her gun policies.

Walz, who was a strong supporter of gun rights while in Congress, says he’s “evolved” on the issue because of the ongoing death toll from mass shootings. “I think they’ll spend a lot of money against me,” he said of the NRA that once supported his campaigns. “I’m dangerous to their agenda.”

RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA

Attitudes about recreational marijuana have shifted dramatically since 2014 when Minnesota made cannabis legal for some medical treatments. Walz and Murphy say it’s now time to legalize pot for recreational use.

Attorney General Swanson disagrees. As the state’s top law enforcement official, she’s concerned about impaired drivers on the road and police being unable to test for marijuana intoxication. Related Articles Women (including Minnesota women) win primaries in record numbers, look to November

“Marijuana has gotten increasingly more potent over the years and I have concerns about how that impacts driving,” Swanson said. “Until someone can show me or convince me there are ways to deal with the driving issue, it is a concern to me.”

All three candidates say they want the state’s drug laws to be enforced fairly and not have people of color disproportionately in the legal system for drug offenses. If pot becomes legal, Murphy says non-violent drug offenders should have their sentences commuted.

Walz, of Mankato, noted bipartisan legislation he co-sponsored that would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to study marijuana for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain.

HEALTH CARE

Minnesota’s next governor will have to deal with ongoing uncertainty in health insurance markets. A reinsurance program designed to keep rates down will soon run out of money and a medical provider tax that funds the state’s health care system for the working poor will sunset at the end of 2019.

All three DFLers say they support current Gov. Mark Dayton’s proposal to offer MinnesotaCare, the state’s health care program for the working poor, to more of the state’s residents. They all also want to use the state’s clout as a large purchaser of medication to lower drug prices for consumers.

“People can get discounts of anywhere from 30 (percent) to 80 percent … just by tapping into the state’s purchasing power,” Swanson said.

Murphy wants to go a step further and move toward a single-payer health care system.

“It’s time for us to lead the nation and guarantee that people who are sick get the care that they need,” she said.

All three candidates also support extending the provider tax, which is expected to raise $692 million next year to fund MinnesotaCare, past its planned sunset in 2019. They also want to explore other sources to pay for MinnesotaCare costs.

TAXES AND SPENDING

Minnesota’s budget was in the red when Dayton took office and he’s gotten kudos from his DFL colleagues for his work to bring it into balance.

He’s also been criticized by Republicans and conservative groups for raising taxes and increasing overall state spending during his two terms.

Erasing budget deficits isn’t easy and all three candidates noted their unique experiences working with limited resources. Walz was in Congress during some high-profile budget battles; Swanson ran a state constitutional office during the recession; and Murphy worked on crafting a budget when the state faced a $6 billion deficit.

All three candidates haven’t ruled out raising taxes, if necessary, to keep the state’s budget balanced or to fund new priorities. At the top of the list is finding a permanent source of money to address the state’s transportation needs.

“There’s a hunger among Minnesotans to have an honest discussion about what you pay for, what you get and what our expectations are,” Walz said.

EXPERIENCE + APPROACH = ELECTABILITY?

Outside of specific policy positions, the candidates’ biggest differences are their histories and each of them believes those experiences uniquely qualifies them to be a successful governor. Related Articles Lori Swanson accused of pressuring staff to help with political work

Murphy has been a Minnesota House member for a dozen years and says her knowledge of the legislative process will make her a more effective governor.

Swanson emphasized her negotiating skills as an attorney and noted she’s the only DFL candidate to win a statewide campaign.

Walz says his connection to Greater Minnesota, his experience working with agriculture and his time in the military will help him appeal to voters statewide.

She was 12.

“Warrior Amelia, after a lifelong battle with Scn2a, passed away today,” parents Josh and Angie Weaver posted on their “Fighting for Amelia” Facebook page. “We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia’s parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl.”

After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a.

According to an article from early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly.

Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session.

Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014.

Legalization didn’t take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state’s two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing.

By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents.

237,238,MN,www.twincities.com,https://www.twincities.com/2018/05/10/mn-medical-marijuana-leafline-labs-andrew-bachman/,"CEO steps down, board replaced at struggling Cottage Grove medical marijuana company","The chief executive of one of Minnesota’s two medical marijuana manufacturers has left the company after years of financial losses.

Andrew Bachman, LeafLine Labs’ co-founder and its chief executive since 2016, is no longer with the company “in any official capacity,” the company said in a Thursday statement to the Associated Press. The company’s entire five-member board has also been replaced.

The statement didn’t give a reason for Bachman’s exit, and a company official didn’t respond to questions about his departure. Bachman didn’t respond to a voicemail or text message seeking comment.

But LeafLine has struggled since medical marijuana sales began in 2015 in Minnesota. The Cottage Grove-based company lost $6.9 million in its first two financial years, and documents provided by state regulators to The AP showed LeafLine lost another $5.3 million in 2017.

Two top executives left LeafLine last year and it temporarily scaled back its operations in November during a supply shortage that Bachman blamed on lab testing delays.

LeafLine was founded and backed by several family members of the popular Minnesota nursery Bachman’s Floral Garden and Gift Centers, though it’s unclear if any family members are still involved at the company after Bachman’s exit. LeafLine was one of two manufacturers selected to grow and cultivate medical marijuana in 2014, the year Minnesota’s Legislature passed its law.

Minnesota’s program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form is banned, and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. Each manufacturer is required to perform several rounds of testing on their medication and must run four dispensaries across the state.

Those restrictions have made business difficult for both of the state’s manufacturers. An audit last year showed the two companies, LeafLine and Minnesota Medical Solutions, had lost a combined $11 million in just two years of legal sales. But while Minnesota Medical Solutions has been trending in the right direction — it turned a small profit in 2017 — LeafLine has lost more money each year it’s been in business.

After losing $4.7 million in 2016, a financial audit shows the company lost another $5.3 million in 2017. All told, LeafLine has lost more than $12 million in its three years of operations.

The company also struggled late last year with supply, turning away some patients and temporarily closing a storefront in Eagan due to what Bachman said was a delay in the state-mandated, third-party testing of its medication.

This isn’t LeafLine’s first brush with turnover. Bachman was the company’s fourth chief executive since the company formed in 2014. He took over after Manny Munson-Regala, previously a top state regulator of the medical marijuana industry, left the company in 2016 after just eight months on the job.

Last fall, the company’s chief medical officer and chief financial officer resigned, with Bachman citing “personal and professional reasons.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration threw the burgeoning movement to legalize marijuana into uncertainty Thursday as it lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the pot trade in states where the drug is legal. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will now leave it up to federal prosecutors to decide what to do when state rules collide with federal drug law.

Sessions’ action, just three days after a legalization law went into effect in California, threatened the future of the young industry, created confusion in states where the drug is legal and outraged both marijuana advocates and some members of Congress, including Sessions’ fellow Republicans. Many conservatives are wary of what they see as federal intrusion in areas they believe must be left to the states.

Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who represents Colorado, one of eight states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, said the change contradicts a pledge Sessions made to him before being confirmed as attorney general. Gardner promised to push legislation to protect marijuana sales, saying he was prepared “to take all steps necessary” to fight the change, including holding up the confirmation of Justice Department nominees. Another Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, called the announcement “disruptive” and “regrettable.”

Colorado’s U.S. attorney, Bob Troyer, said his office won’t change its approach to prosecution, despite Sessions’ guidance. Prosecutors there have always focused on marijuana crimes that “create the greatest safety threats” and will continue to be guided by that, Troyer said.

The largely hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement set forth by Barack Obama’s Justice Department allowed the pot business to flourish into a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund some state government programs. What happens now is in doubt.

“In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” considering the seriousness of a crime and its impact on the community, Sessions told prosecutors in a one-page memo.

While Sessions, a longtime marijuana foe, has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump’s top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, this change reflects his own concerns. He railed against marijuana as an Alabama senator and has assailed it as comparable to heroin.

Trump, as a candidate, said pot should be left up to the states, but his personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown.

It is not clear how the change might affect states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes. A congressional amendment blocks the Justice Department from interfering with medical marijuana programs in states where it is allowed. Justice officials said they would follow the law, but would not preclude the possibility of medical-marijuana related prosecutions.

Officials wouldn’t say whether federal prosecutors would target marijuana shops and legal growers, nor would they speculate on whether pot prosecutions would increase.

They denied the timing was connected to the opening of California sales, which are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years. And, the officials said, Thursday’s action might not be the only step toward greater marijuana enforcement. The department has the authority to sue states on the grounds that state laws regulating pot are unconstitutional, pre-empted by federal law.

Asked about the change, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said only that Trump’s top priority is enforcing federal law “and that is regardless of what the topic is, whether it’s marijuana or whether it’s immigration.”

The Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and keep it out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. That memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes.

But the Sessions Justice Department believed the Cole memo created a “safe harbor” for marijuana by allowing states to flout federal law, Justice Department officials said. Sessions, in his memo, called the Obama guidance “unnecessary.”

He and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers who have taken advantage to illegally grow and ship the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more.

Marijuana advocates argue those concerns are overblown and contend legalizing the drug reduces crime by eliminating the need for a black market. They quickly condemned Sessions’ move as a return to outdated drug-war policies that unduly affected minorities.

Sessions “wants to maintain a system that has led to tremendous injustice … and that has wasted federal resources on a huge scale,” said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “If Sessions thinks that makes sense in terms of prosecutorial priorities, he is in a very bizarre ideological state, or a deeply problematic one.”

But the decision was a win for marijuana opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action.

“There is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it’s also the beginning of the story and not the end,” said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. “This is a victory. It’s going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years.”

Yet confusion remains.

Jane Stinson, part-owner of the retail marijuana shop Enlighten Alaska in Anchorage, called Thursday’s action confusing and worried that it could harm her business. The change, she said, “can have so many ripple effects we just don’t know.”

The change reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed more lenient Obama-era criminal justice policies. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower-level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects.

A task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration’s more hands-off approach, something Sessions promised to do.

The 31-year Duluth, Minn., woman “was placing all my bets on the medical marijuana” to relieve the pain from the rheumatoid arthritis with which she had been diagnosed at age 23, she said Wednesday.

She had a dose in August 2016, soon after intractable pain was added as an approved condition for treatment with medical cannabis in Minnesota. Not only did it fail to relieve her pain, Nelson said, it “gave me the worst anxiety I ever experienced in my life.”

After trying it again last July with the same results, Nelson called the pharmacist at cannabis provider LeafLine Labs in Hibbing. He told her she probably was having an allergic reaction and advised her to seek medical help immediately.

“I didn’t because I didn’t want to give medical marijuana a bad rap,” Nelson said. “I’m only one person. It might work for other people.”

Indeed, a study released Thursday by the Minnesota Department of Health reports that some Minnesotans are finding medical cannabis helpful in their battle with “pain whose cause cannot be removed,” as the department defines it.

“Many patients are commenting how happy they are that they’re getting at least equivalent pain relief without being on the other drugs that had caused such terrible side effects,” said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the Health Department’s office of medical cannabis, in a phone interview.

“This study helps improve our understanding of the potential of medical cannabis for treating pain,” Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said in a statement announcing the results. “We need additional and more rigorous study, but these results are clinically significant and promising for both pain treatment and reducing opioid dependence.”

According to the study:

Among 2,174 patients who purchased medical cannabis for intractable pain and completed the required self-evaluation from Aug. 1-Dec. 31, 2016, 61 percent reported a high level of benefit (at least a 6 on a 7-point scale).

Little or no benefit (a score of 1-3), was reported by 10 percent of patients.

42 percent of patients who reported a moderate to high level of pain on a 10-point scale when they began taking medical cannabis achieved a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more in the first month.

For 22 percent, a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more was maintained over at least four months.

Of 353 patients who self-reported taking opioid medications when they started using medical cannabis, 63 percent reduced or eliminated opioid use by the end of six months.

Fifty-five patients taking cannabis for intractable pain reported severe adverse side effects, meaning side effects that interrupted usual daily activities.

But medical cannabis still isn’t readily available for everyone, Arneson said, nor is it affordable for everyone.

More than 1,100 medical practitioners in Minnesota will certify patients for medical cannabis, Arneson said.

“The numbers are actually quite good. … (But) we’ve gotten many complaints from the northeastern quadrant of our state about having difficulty finding someone to certify them.”

Nelson said she went to a clinic in the Twin Cities to be certified as a medical cannabis patient because she couldn’t find a local provider.

Another common complaint is the price, Arneson said. Although medical cannabis is starting to be covered under workers comp programs, in general it’s not covered by insurance.

“These patients are paying hundreds of dollars per month,” he said. “The thing that I feel bad about is that this program is actually not affordable for the majority of the state’s population.”"
241,242,MN,www.twincities.com,https://www.twincities.com/2017/02/09/minnesota-legislators-propose-legalizing-marijuana-use/,Legalize marijuana in Minnesota? Lawmakers want state’s voters to decide,"Nine Minnesota lawmakers want to ask the public: Should Minnesota legalize personal use of marijuana?

The nine — all Democrats in a Republican-controlled House — proposed a constitutional amendment to ask Minnesotans that question. But the chief backers know the question is unlikely to make it to voters’ 2018 ballots.

“This is a conversation starter. We are all well aware that our colleagues who are chairs … are not interested in having this conversation right now,” said Rep. Jason Metsa, DFL-Virginia. “But you have to have a starting point.”

Just three years ago, Minnesota legalized use of cannabis derivatives for certain medical conditions. That puts Minnesota laws in line with the majority of the country — 28 states have legalized medical use of the product.

But eight states have legalized recreational use of the drug, all by ballot measure. Minnesota does not use statewide ballot questions, other than by constitutional amendment so the House members are going that route.

“I do think this belongs in the constitution because this is about allowing, giving Minnesotans a right that I believe they should have and they believe they should have,” said Rep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester.

Marijuana remains illegal under federal law but, under the past administration, states felt able to set their own laws despite the federal prohibition. Related Articles Women (including Minnesota women) win primaries in record numbers, look to November

Kofi Annan led UN through one of its most turbulent periods

Along with the constitutional proposal, five House Democrats also introduced a measure to legalize adults’ marijuana use on Thursday, without going through the ballot process.

“The world is changing, and Minnesotans are rightfully developing different attitudes on marijuana,” Rep. John Applebaum, DFL-Minnetonka, said. He is sponsoring the measure to legalize marijuana for personal use outright.

Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat who signed the medical cannabis law, said he is not a fan of either proposal.

“I don’t support it because law enforcement is very, very concerned. They’re the ones who are on the streets and in their cars every day and night,” Dayton said. “This is one more added onto that that we don’t need in our society which is already suffering from an epidemic of opioid and heroin and other abuses.”

On Thursday, he said he did not know if legalizing adult use of the drug rises to the level of a constitutional amendment and that he would be interested to know if Minnesotans support legalization.

“I do like the idea of asking the people of Minnesota… if there’s really an overwhelming popular will for that, that would be something to consider,” he said. “Probably public opinion has changed, I don’t know to what extent.”

Republican Rep. Tony Cornish, a Republican from Vernon Center and chair of the House public safety committee, said he’s heard from people on both sides of the issue and has studied up on it. But with law enforcement weighing against legalization, and parents and drug counselors opining against it, the issue will not move far this year.

“I think it’s an exercise in futility,” Cornish said.

State Rep. Pat Garofalo, a Republican from Farmington who pushed Minnesota to legalize medical use of the drug, said he is not impressed with the measures the Democrats proposed.

“It is an important change that merits thoughtful consideration and deliberation. So far I have yet to see that seriousness in the presentation of this proposal,” he said.

But supporters say they are looking at the real life consequences of prohibiting marijuana use.

“We have to be very careful who we incarcerate and why. Because we affect the rest of their life,” said Rep. Alice Hausman, DFL-St. Paul. Related Articles State moves closer to finalizing new teacher licensing rules

Applebaum said that even though the drug is illegal, people are still using it. Minnesota could make money off that use, he said.

“We should capitalize on it, make sure that it’s safe and it can add some much-needed tax revenues for our state,” said Applebaum.

In Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is sanctioned by the state, more than $1 billion worth of marijuana was sold in 2016, bringing in more than $150 million to state coffers."

Medical marijuana goes on sale Wednesday in Minnesota and along with it will come a cascade of questions about the drug’s handling, legality and availability.

The following answers have been taken from the state Office of Medical Cannabis, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, companies manufacturing medical marijuana and interviews with patients, police and officials.

Is it legal?

Yes and no. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug — the most dangerous type. Heroin is in the same group. But federal officials have agreed not to prosecute medical marijuana use that is consistent with state laws.

So states are free to legalize it?

Yes, for now. But the federal government retains the right to challenge the marijuana laws of any state.

So marijuana is as bad as heroin?

According to the federal government, yes. Cocaine and methamphetamines are considered less dangerous, as a Schedule 2 drugs.

That’s hard to believe. How do they know what drugs are dangerous?

That is not clear. About 15,000 Americans die from overdoses of prescription painkillers every year. The most common are Vicodin, OxyContin, Opana and methadone — all Schedule 2 drugs. Tobacco kills about 400,000. Marijuana overdoses did not kill a single person last year.

So is marijuana harmless?

No. The federal government says it can be addictive, and it has been linked with driving fatalities in states where it’s been legalized.

Who gets medical marijuana?

Only patients who are legal Minnesota residents and have been diagnosed with one of the qualifying conditions are eligible. Minnesota’s list of qualifying conditions has been set by law and includes cancer that causes pain or nausea, glaucoma, Tourette syndrome, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, AIDS, HIV, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis or any painful condition expected to kill the patient within a year.

An advisory panel is considering a recommendation to add intractable pain to the list of qualifying conditions.

Do the patients smoke it?

No. Only pills are allowed, as well as oils and some vaporized inhalants.

Who makes it?

Two Minnesota companies. The LeafLine Labs facility is in Cottage Grove, and the Minnesota Medical Solutions facility is in Otsego. Each will sell marijuana through four dispensaries statewide.

Where?

Dispensaries will open Wednesday in Eagan and Minneapolis. Others are tentatively scheduled to open later this summer in St. Paul, Maple Grove, St. Cloud, Moorhead, Hibbing and Rochester.

What will the marijuana cost?

A typical patient will pay $200 annually to register with the state and then pay $300 to $500 for a month’s supply.

Is it covered by insurance?

No. However, patients on Social Security Disability, Medical Assistance or Medicaid are eligible for a reduced fee of $50.

Does it cure anything?

No. It’s primarily used to relieve pain, reduce nausea and stimulate the appetite.

Is it effective as a medicine?

The evidence is sketchy.

It is “moderately” effective in reducing “neuropathic pain” and cancer-related pain, according to a report issued Tuesday by the Journal of the American Medical Association. It also reduces muscle spasms in muscular dystrophy patients.

But the report said that for many other ailments — including some on Minnesota’s list of qualifying conditions — it is not effective. These include glaucoma, AIDS-related pain, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and depression.

In addition, the report said marijuana-taking patients had a “much greater risk” of kidney, liver and psychiatric disorders.

The report criticized states for allowing medical marijuana to bypass the rigorous approval process that all other medicines are subjected to.

Are Minnesota police worried?

Apparently not. They have worked for almost a year with the manufacturers and describe the security at the sites as excellent.

The medical marijuana won’t cause problems with arrests, they say, because most of it will be in pill form. All smoked marijuana remains illegal.

How does a person become a registered patient?

— Start by contacting your health care practitioner who has responsibility for your care connected to your qualifying condition. Check to be sure he or she is able to certify you for the program.

— When your practitioner has certified your qualifying condition, you will receive an email from the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis with a link to register online and an information sheet you should review before completing registration.

— Register online.

— Visit a cannabis patient center.

— Fill out a patient self-evaluation form, which is needed each time you need more medical cannabis.

243,244,MN,www.twincities.com,https://www.twincities.com/2017/05/17/study-minnesota-medical-marijuana-patients-report-benefits/,Study: Minnesota medical marijuana patients report benefits,"Most patients who used medical marijuana during the first year of Minnesota’s tightly regulated program reported benefits, the state Health Department said Tuesday.

The study was based on patient surveys and other data. The program began July 1, 2015, and the data runs through June 31, 2016.

“Based on this evidence from the first year, Minnesota’s approach is providing many people with substantial benefits, minimal side effects and no serious adverse events,” Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger said in a statement.

Patients were asked how much benefit they believe they received from using medical cannabis on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 meaning no benefit and 7 meaning a great deal of benefit. Across all patients, 64 percent indicated a benefit rating of 6 or 7. Nine percent indicated little or no benefit. Most patients also reported clinically meaningful reductions in symptoms for conditions including seizures, Tourette syndrome, Crohn’s disease and muscle spasms.

Patients also reported that affordability remains a problem as the drug is not covered by health insurance.

Minnesota’s program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form of the drug is banned — no smoking or vaporizing the material is allowed — and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. The state added chromic pain to the list of allowable conditions last summer, which allowed thousands more patients to buy the medication. Due to high costs and an aggressive rollout schedule, the state’s two licensed manufacturers lost a combined $11 million in just two years of sales, according to financial documents obtained by the Associated Press.

The department’s complete study is due out this summer."

"" We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia's parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl.""

After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a.

When the News Tribune visited the Weaver home in early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly.

Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session.

Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014.

Legalization didn't take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state's two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing.

By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents.

A photo of Angie and Amelia Weaver was featured on the LeafLine Labs website, with a link to their story and more pictures.

But Amelia was still a sick girl with a compromised immune system. She suffered setbacks and hospitalizations, including an anxious drive to the Mayo Clinic on Christmas Day 2015.

She recovered slowly, but suffered additional setbacks and last Sunday again was airlifted to the Mayo Clinic, her parents reported on Facebook. ""Sadly, Amelia is in very rough shape,"" they told friends and family last week.

Amelia Weaver was the second medical marijuana user whom the News Tribune profiled to die this year. Jess Blake, a Duluth resident who taught in Esko, died on Feb. 22 of glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of brain cancer. As with Amelia, Blake and her family and friends reported a significant improvement in symptoms after she began taking medical marijuana.

The Weavers said on Facebook that details for a celebration of Amelia's life will be announced within the next few days."

256,257,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/healthcare/4410944-study-marijuana-helping-some-pain,Study: Marijuana helping some with pain,"She had a dose in August 2016, soon after intractable pain was added as an approved condition for treatment with medical cannabis in Minnesota. Not only did it fail to relieve her pain, Nelson said, it ""gave me the worst anxiety I ever experienced in my life.""

After trying it again last July with the same results, Nelson called the pharmacist at cannabis provider LeafLine Labs in Hibbing. He told her she probably was having an allergic reaction and advised her to seek medical help immediately.

""I didn't because I didn't want to give medical marijuana a bad rap,"" Nelson said. ""I'm only one person. It might work for other people.""

Indeed, a study released today by the Minnesota Department of Health reports that some Minnesotans are finding medical cannabis helpful in their battle with ""pain whose cause cannot removed,"" as the health department defines it.

""Many patients are commenting how happy they are that they're getting at least equivalent pain relief without being on the other drugs that had caused such terrible side effects,"" said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the health department's office of medical cannabis, in a phone interview.

According to the study:

• Among 2,174 patients who purchased medical cannabis for intractable pain and completed the required self-evaluation from Aug. 1-Dec. 31, 2016, 61 percent reported a high level of benefit (at least a six on a seven-point scale).

• Little or no benefit (a score of 1-3), was reported by 10 percent of patients.

• 42 percent of patients who reported a moderate to high level of pain on a 10-point scale when they began taking medical cannabis achieved a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more in the first month.

• For 22 percent, a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more was maintained over at least four months.

• Of 353 patients who self-reported taking opioid medications when they started using medical cannabis, 63 percent reduced or eliminated opioid use by the end of six months.

• Fifty-five patients taking cannabis for intractable pain reported severe adverse side effects, meaning side effects that interrupted usual daily activities.

But medical cannabis still isn't readily available for everyone, Arneson said, nor is it affordable for everyone.

More than 1,100 medical practitioners in Minnesota will certify patients for medical cannabis, Arneson said. ""The numbers are actually quite good. ... (But) we've gotten many complaints from the Northeastern quadrant of our state about having difficulty finding someone to certify them.""

Nelson said she went to a clinic in the Twin Cities to be certified as a medical cannabis patient because she couldn't find a local provider.

Another common complaint is the price, Arneson said. Although medical cannabis is starting to be covered under workers' comp programs, in general it's not covered by insurance.

""These patients are paying hundreds of dollars per month,"" he said. ""The thing that I feel bad about is that this program is actually not affordable for the majority of the state's population."""

""They've got to find a way to inform people.""

When Mullen's fiancee, the late Linnea Stephan, was fighting brain cancer, they sought a prescription for medical marijuana to counter the nausea caused by chemotherapy, he said. But they couldn't find any oncologist at either Essentia Health or St. Luke's willing to certify her for that condition.

Unable to find a certifying provider in Duluth, the couple turned to a Twin Cities clinic.

""It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in Duluth, but that's part of the problem is how would I find out?"" Mullen asked. ""How would I know who it would even be?""

There's no provider directory on the website of the Minnesota Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis. The department ""cannot say"" what providers are in the registry, said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the cannabis office.

That came as a surprise to the Health Department's boss when she was asked about it during a visit to Duluth last week. ""That's a new one on me, that we don't do that,"" said Jan Malcolm, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed as health commissioner in late January.

Duluth hospitals

Oncologists are the only practitioners at St. Luke's who are on the registry, said Dr. Gary Peterson, the hospital's chief medical officer. That's not to say that an oncologist would necessarily agree to certify a particular patient.

""I would think that each individual cancer patient ... would be evaluated individually as to the appropriateness of medical marijuana,"" he said. ""We wouldn't expect that to be the first-line treatment.""

But the decision about whether to certify patients is left up to the practitioners, Peterson said.

Essentia Health takes a more centralized approach. Dr. Jeffrey Lyon, an internist who is on the medical cannabis committee at Essentia, said practitioners are asked to try ""evidence-supported treatments"" before considering medical marijuana as an option. If the clinician then wants to recommend medical marijuana, he or she first must refer the case to the committee, which then rules on whether the patient can be certified.

An expedited process is allowed for terminally ill patients with ""intractable nausea,"" he said.

Lyon has led the committee since the beginning of the year, and there hasn't been a single request during that time, he said.

Arneson said he senses frustration from prospective patients in the Duluth area.

""We get complaints about not being able to find (a practitioner) to certify a patient from all over the state, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""But we have received a number from the northeastern part of the state with specific complaints about organizations.""

St. Luke's practitioners who aren't on the registry might refer patients to TimeWise in Duluth, Peterson said. TimeWise, a clinic in Lake Elmo, Minn., set up an office in Duluth two years ago. Its sole practitioner, Dr. Adam Locketz, staffs the Duluth office at least once a month, he said.

He has certified close to 2,000 patients for medical marijuana, Locketz said, but he couldn't say how many of those were out of his Duluth office.

Referrals from Duluth practitioners are ""slowly, slowly starting to happen,"" he said.

The cost

Income may be a factor in holding down the number of participants from some parts of the state.

""Most people can't afford this program,"" Arneson said. ""That's just the reality of it. So it depends a little bit on the distribution of income, I would say.""

The average monthly cost for marijuana patients in Minnesota is $150, Locketz said.

But there are other costs before the patient even gets to the marijuana distribution center, especially in the first year. Locketz said he charges $250 for the first visit to certify a patient, with declining rates after that. The state charges another $200 to place the patient on the registry, and then $50 every succeeding year. A patient must be recertified each year.

The costs and the hurdles have created a problem for the state's medical marijuana program, Lyon said.

""The state has created this system, and they're not seeing the number of people buying their product that they had hoped for,"" he said.

Nonetheless, state data show growth in the patient registry every month since the program started accepting patients in June 2015. The curve became steeper starting in August 2016, when intractable pain became a condition for which marijuana could be prescribed.

As of March 31, 9,435 patients were enrolled and in active status in the registry, the Office of Medical Cannabis reported. That was up from 5,119 a year earlier.

Nearly two out of three Minnesota patients who received medical marijuana are certified for intractable pain.

Those patients may be able to break their dependence on opioids, Locketz said.

""Daily I'm seeing patients back who, over a period of years, have been able to use this to come off of fentanyl patches or oxycodone,"" he said.

But while data are coming from states with legalized medical marijuana showing a trend toward lower opioid use, Lyon said there's still a lack of quality clinical research in the field.

""Maybe medical marijuana will be a significant tool in decreasing opioid abuse,"" he said. ""We just don't know.""

So why are so many people using it?,"An aesthetician, Franklin started working with an Oregon chemist last year to make CBD products for the skin, believing that a little of it swiped onto the face could help repair the ravages of age.

But Franklin also takes CBD in gummy form, popping some in the morning and some at night. Like a magic pill, she says, it wipes away the sleeplessness and the stress and the nagging pain in her back that has left her with a slight limp, though she's only in her 30s.

""It's crazy,"" she acknowledges. But she insists that CBD can do it all. ""It's just crazy, the different things that it has helped.""

For Generation Anxious, affixed to its phones and stricken by news alerts, overworked and under-rested, the mysterious substance known as CBD is quickly becoming the new ""it"" drug.

Devotees whisper about CBD as a soothing remedy for racing thoughts and aching extremities. CBD for those restless nights. Also, somehow, CBD for those listless mornings.

Suddenly, you can find sugar-coated CBD gummies to gnaw on, and balms to rub onto pulse points. There's CBD for your dog (gluten-free and pumpkin-flavored!) and CBD for your aching feet. You can buy bottled CBD water in trendy, seasonally-driven fast-casual restaurants, and bags of CBD-laced coffee in shops on busy thoroughfares in Washington, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas and dozens of other cities.

Back at Joy's, Osorio, the mask still plastered on her face, pipes up about her own experience with CBD, how it seemed to quiet the back spasms she has suffered since an accident years ago.

Plus, is it just her imagination, or do her wrinkles seem to have faded?

Have we mentioned CBD's relationship to the green gold mine that is the American marijuana industry? (Surprise.)

Also known by its full name, cannabidiol (pronounced canna-bid-EYE-ol), CBD is just one of hundreds of compounds hiding within the cannabis plant. It's a distant cousin of THC, the stuff in pot that's notorious for getting you stoned and for inciting the wrath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

But while the term ""cannabidiol"" smacks of weed, ""CBD"" somehow sounds . . . tame. Like something you can name-drop around Mom, like turmeric and melatonin and charcoal and biotin or any of the other wonder-elixirs that have replaced Prozac in America's medicine cabinets.

The dizzying rise of CBD is a story of timing as much as of branding. As more states deregulate marijuana, the Reefer Madness stigma that surrounded it for decades seems to have gone up in smoke.

But here's why CBD appeals to some who would never smoke a joint after dinner: Take a few milligrams of CBD as, say, an oil slipped onto the tongue or a piece of candy, and it tastes unmistakably like cannabis, which is to say, slightly minty and herbacious, and just a little funky. But cannabidiol's effect is startlingly anti-climactic. It's weed without the high.

And this may be why CBD is legal in many states, including several that don't allow legal recreational or medical marijuana.

An organic chemist named Roger Adams isolated cannabidiol amid a wave of research into the medicinal promise of marijuana in the 1930s and '40s. He filed for a patent, and in the decades that followed, marijuana growers experimented with raising plants with high levels of CBD and almost no THC, hoping that a puff might trigger its own trippy bang.

It didn't take long for them to realize that they were wrong. So, so wrong.

""CBD became known as the hippie's disappointment,"" says Stuart W. Titus, the chief executive of Medical Marijuana Inc., a producer of several CBD oils and products that entered the market in 2012.

Now, the hippie's disappointment is back, rebranded as the stressed-out modern office drudge's salvation.

Gwyneth Paltrow's obsessively followed lifestyle site Goop, never one to miss a chance to gush about a wellness trend, recently published a guide to CBD cocktails. One of the many cushy lounges offering swag at Coachella next month is promising CBD oils, along with yoga and vegan food, for all its guests. A writer for the website the Cut wrote that a little CBD made her feel ""delightful.""

""Some people do want the high, of course,"" Titus says. ""But others are looking for the health and wellness benefits.""

Which, according to the charter members of the Cult of Cannabidiol, are many. Infinite, in fact.

""I like to call it the super-nutrient, the super plant,"" says Spike Mendelsohn, the Washington-based former ""Top Chef"" contestant behind fast-casual restaurants including Good Stuff Eatery. More recently, he's a partner in the CBD-infused ""wellness drink"" Plnt Water, which comes in such flavors as turmeric and ginger, and matcha and mint and, for now, is available in a healthy-leaning fast-casual restaurant chain.

""It's really mother's milk,"" he says. ""It's natural.""

Naturally, not everyone is buying the hype.

Last year, the FDA dinged a number of companies hawking CBD based on unsubstantiated claims - mainly that it could cure or reverse cancer.

The agency hasn't evaluated all the claims around CBD, but some in the research field already have their doubts.

""I think you're dealing with disease states where people are grasping for answers,"" says Timothy E. Welty, a professor of pharmacy at Drake University in Des Moines. ""So they're turning to this and saying, 'This is the answer.' ""

Welty has been involved with CBD use in patients with epilepsy, and at least two reputable studies have shown it can relieve seizures. But as for the rest of it - the anxiety and sleep claims, all anecdotal - he's doubtful. ""They're not scientifically founded, in my mind,"" he says.

So: Is CBD just this year's activated charcoal or functional mushroom? Harmless enough to pop without worry?

""I would be very cautious,"" Welty says. With no oversight of the candies and waters and food products containing CBD, he says, ""you're not sure what you're really getting.""

For true believers, though, it's worth venturing into the unknown if it means tossing out the aspirin and the painkillers and the anti-depressants.

""For a long time now, there have been people approaching a lot of chefs about working with cannabis and edibles,"" Mendelsohn says. Weed seems like fun. ""But is it worth risking all the other work that I have? I'm in business with my family. I do a lot of work with kids. I do a lot of work with policy.""

Drugs? Unwise. The wellness space? Whole different ballgame, he says. Plus, there's no question there's a market for CBD. ""People,"" he says, ""are already buying it.""

Franklin is convinced of its powers. ""I've had friends take CBD for the first time, and call me and say, 'Where have you been all my life?' "" she says.

260,261,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4471281-north-dakota-supporters-legalizing-marijuana-push-vote,"In North Dakota, supporters of legalizing marijuana push for vote","Like a recent successful medical marijuana measure in Oklahoma, the effort has largely flown under the radar, with no financial backing from national drug policy groups like the Drug Policy Alliance and the Marijuana Policy Project. And like in Oklahoma, North Dakota is a deep red state that hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964.

Those factors could make for a tough sell to voters in November. But if the measure qualifies for the ballot, supporters are hoping a pitch based on criminal justice reform will carry them to victory in a state where marijuana users have some of the nation's highest odds of getting arrested - and face some of the nation's toughest criminal penalties if they do.

The bill, as written by supporters, would legalize the possession, sale and use of marijuana for North Dakotans age 21 and older. It would also expunge previous marijuana convictions from North Dakotans' criminal records. The measure leaves a lot of open questions: It places no limits on possession, for instance, and doesn't set up any sort of regulatory structure for the sales it would allow.

Supporters say that's by design. ""We leave our bill wide open so the legislature can do their job - regulations, taxes, zoning, whatever,"" said Cole Haymond, an adviser to the Legalize ND campaign. ""This bill is by far the most progressive, yet most conservative marijuana legalization bill that will be on any ballot across the country.""

Haymond shared internal polling conducted by the campaign showing that as of February, 46 percent of North Dakota voters supported the measure, 39 percent opposed it, and 15 percent were undecided.

North Dakota has one of the lowest rates of marijuana use in the nation. Fewer than 10 percent of state residents used the drug in 2016, according to the federal National Survey on Drug Use and Health, putting it at 47th place among the 50 states plus the District of Columbia for marijuana use.

But the relatively few North Dakotans who do use the drug have some of the nation's greatest chances of getting arrested for it. In 2016, for instance, 61,000 North Dakotans used marijuana at least once, while 2,513 of them were arrested for simple marijuana possession, according to FBI crime data compiled by NORML, a pro-legalization group.

That works out to a rate of 41 arrests per 1,000 users, the second-highest in the United States. By contrast, neighboring Minnesota arrests marijuana users at a rate of seven per 1,000. In Vermont and Massachusetts, marijuana arrest rates were less than one per 1,000 even before those states legalized use of the drug.

Data from the North Dakota attorney general's office shows that marijuana arrests have been making up an ever larger share of total arrests in recent years. From 1990 to 2013, marijuana arrests increased from 1.7 percent of all arrests to 6.9 percent, meaning roughly one in every 15 arrests in North Dakota was for a marijuana offense. Data from more recent years isn't directly comparable to those numbers due to changes in reporting methods.

North Dakotans also face particularly stiff penalties if they are caught using marijuana. Possession of less than an ounce is considered a misdemeanor punishable by 30 days of jail time and a $1,500 fine. Possession of anything over an ounce is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

The North Dakota secretary of state still needs to certify the signatures for the measure to qualify for the ballot. Either way, national marijuana policy groups say they're keeping an eye on what happens in North Dakota in the coming months.

""Grass-roots efforts like the one in North Dakota are inspiring important public dialogue about the benefits of adopting an alternative policy that treats marijuana more like alcohol,"" said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""It remains to be seen whether it will qualify for the ballot, but there is no doubt it has advanced the conversation and the movement toward ending marijuana prohibition, both in North Dakota and nationwide.""

261,262,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/science-and-nature/4406069-duluth-researcher-looking-effects-cannabis-giving-tobacco-smoking,Duluth researcher looking at effects of cannabis on giving up tobacco smoking,"The former, not so much.

""It's still difficult,"" said Carvalho, who gave up his habit in May and continues to wear a nicotine patch to help control his cravings. ""Someone can be smoking weed right next to me, and I'm fine. ... If somebody's smoking a cigarette in front of me, I'll have to get up and walk away.""

Now, a Duluth researcher is launching a study to seek to discover, in part, what effect marijuana use has on individuals trying to quit tobacco cigarette smoking.

The study will take place in Duluth and the Twin Cities, both prime places, said the researcher, Mustafa al'Absi of the University of Minnesota Medical School's Duluth campus. He was involved in a national study a few years ago, al'Absi said, that included data on marijuana and tobacco use in 10 cities. In four of those cities, the practice of smoking both tobacco and marijuana was more prevalent: San Francisco, Baltimore, Minneapolis and Duluth.

""And that's one reason why we thought this would be a good study for the community,"" said al'Absi, a behavioral medicine specialist who directs the newly formed Duluth Global Health Research Institute. ""Especially at this time when more and more marijuana is becoming available. More and more states are legalizing it. We want to be ahead in knowing how our smokers could still try to quit.""

This brings up a dicey subject. For his study, al'Absi needs people who smoke both tobacco and marijuana. But smoking marijuana recreationally still is illegal in Minnesota. Can participants identify themselves as marijuana users without recriminations?

""Well, everything they tell us is confidential,"" al'Absi said. ""We have a federal certificate of confidentiality, which gives us the right to withhold all information.""

Al'Absi and others have extensively studied smoking cessation, he said. But little data are available on how marijuana use might play into attempts to quit.

The purpose of studying that is not just to gain information, al'Absi said. The point is to use that information to help people quit smoking — something that's extremely beneficial but extremely difficult.

""If you're using marijuana or other substances, I want to know if that will make a difference in how I treat you,"" he said. ""The research that we're doing here will help answer that question.""

Al'Absi knows how difficult it is. Like many, the 55-year-old started smoking as a teenager. He quit around the time, 20 years ago, that he and his family moved to Duluth.

He didn't succeed immediately.

""I tried multiple times,"" al'Absi said.

Carvalho also experienced relapses. But he has refrained for the past five months, he said last week.

Like al'Absi, Carvalho started smoking as a teenager, and when he decided to quit, he was a pack-a-day smoker. He's using the lightest form of a nicotine patch now, but went beyond recommended lengths of time for each phase of the treatment because his smoking habit had been so entrenched.

For most people, the patch doesn't work all that well, al'Absi said — it has a 10 percent success rate. But it works better for men than for women.

His previous studies show why, al'Absi said. Women tend to experience more psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, when they try to quit. For men, the craving is more chemical, so the nicotine boost from the patch is more likely to help them.

But the bottom line for al'Absi is the effect of stress.

""Stress is a big trigger for addiction,"" he said. ""It goes without saying that people under a high level of stress seek comfort, seek a way to alleviate their negative feelings. And if you're a smoker already, then lighting up is one way to do that.""

One size doesn't fit all when it comes to quitting, al'Absi said.

His research feeds into what's known as personalized or precision medicine, in which the treatment plan differs with the individual.

""So that what triggers ... your craving for cigarettes may be different from what triggers my craving,"" he said. ""You have a different life situation. We have different reasons why we smoke.""

Al'Absi's study is funded by the National Institutes of Health. About $2 million a year in research funding comes to the medical school's Duluth campus from that source, said Dr. Paula Termuhlen, the dean for the campus.

Such studies give the campus a significant reputation, she said.

""A project where people locally participate, like this, then translates into recognition that in many respects is international,"" Termuhlen said. ""So that when there are problems to be solved they come to Duluth to say, 'Hey, you've got the people there to do it.'""

To get involved

Mustafa al'Absi and his team at the Behavioral Medicine Laboratories of the University of Minnesota Medical School's Duluth campus are looking for participants in their stress response smoking cessation study.

Smokers who are interested in quitting, at least 18 years old, generally healthy and who use marijuana regularly are wanted. Compensation will be provided.

It now goes back to the House of Commons with dozens of amendments. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced the legislation last year.

""We are very much focused on the control and legalization of marijuana, because the current system is not working,"" Trudeau said last month.

Medical marijuana is legal in Canada, and the country is a top exporter of the drug for medical purposes. Canada would become the second country to legalize the production, sale and consumption of marijuana; Uruguay did so last year.

The House of Commons must now vote to accept or reject the amendments before sending the legislation back to the Senate. While the majority of the changes are minor and technical, some are large, including a provision that allows provinces to prohibit people from growing marijuana in their homes. Two provinces, Manitoba and Quebec, plan to prohibit homegrown marijuana. The amendment would make it more difficult for opponents to mount legal challenges.

Sen. Tony Dean, an Independent from Ontario, said Thursday's vote was historic and that the legislation is designed to combat social ills such as high rates of youth consumption and the criminalization of those who possess the drug, particularly young indigenous people.

""We have a government that had the will to try to bring a sophisticated, complex approach to a complex policy challenge,"" Dean said in an interview. ""The government is being clear that this has investments in public health, community health and harm reduction.""

The bill has seen opposition from conservative politicians and indigenous leaders who have said the bill could adversely affect Canada's youth.

Sen. Leo Housakos, a conservative from Quebec, said he is concerned that support for the bill amounts to ""an attempt to normalize marijuana,"" something he thinks will have deleterious effects.

""Unfortunately, this bill makes marijuana more accessible to teenagers, particularly, than ever before, and it's very concerning,"" Housakos told reporters after the vote.

The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has estimated that Canada could see $6.5 billion in legal retail sales by 2020 if the legislation becomes law, equivalent to about $5 billion in U.S. currency. Statistics Canada said that people 15 and older spent $5.7 million in Canadian currency on marijuana in 2017, even though the drug was illegal recreationally.

Investment from the United States, where recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia, has been pouring into Canada ahead of expected legalization. Canada also is taking advantage of the international market by supplying cannabis worldwide, said Jay Czarkowski, founding partner of Canna Advisors, a Colorado-based consulting group.

""Canada is exporting all over the world right now. That should be us,"" he said of the United States.

Regulators believe CBD does show therapeutic promise. But they also say the miracle drug claims are wrong or based on anecdotes rather than scientific evidence. Last fall, the FDA warned four companies to stop saying things like, ""CBD makes cancer cells commit 'suicide.'""

UC San Diego dealt with the issue by asking the Ray and Tye Noorda Foundation of Lindon, Utah, for $4.7 million to study whether CBD can ease the most severe symptoms of autism, including seizures, self-injuring behavior, and crippling anxiety.

The foundation agreed, and it is urging the federal government to remove marijuana from its list of Schedule 1 drugs so that cannabis can be widely studied.

Schedule 1 drugs are defined as substances and chemicals that have no accepted use in medicine and a high potential for abuse. As a result, the government provides little money to study marijuana.

The listing contradicts the findings of many federal, industry and university scientists who say cannabis appears to be helpful for treating a variety of diseases and disorders, including epilepsy, chronic pain and the vomiting associated with chemotherapy.

Parents are pressing scientists to expand their research to autism spectrum disorder, a developmental brain disorder that afflicts 3.5 million people in the U.S. Some parents have given CBD to their autistic children, notably in states like California where medical and recreational marijuana are legal.

""I've spoken to parents who swear that this is effective — but it needs to undergo scientific research,"" said Scott Badesch, president of the Autism Society of America, which is based in Bethesda, Md.

UC San Diego's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research will conduct a clinical trial involving 30 autistic children with severe symptoms. The children, who will be recruited from throughout the region, will be given a liquid form of CBD that will be provided by a federally approved laboratory in Arizona.

During the study, which begins next year, the children will also undergo behavioral testing, MRI scans and electroencephalograms. The patients will range in age from 8 to 12.

""It's important to do this study to show whether there is objective improvement, or whether is detrimental or whether it doesn't do anything at all,"" said Dr. Doris Trauner, the UC San Diego pediatrics and neuroscience expert who will lead this aspect of the study.

The university says the overall project, led by Dr. Igor Grant, ""will determine if CBD is safe and tolerable and whether it alleviates adverse symptoms of ASD; determine whether and how CBD alters brain activity, neurotransmitters and/or brain network connectivity; and determine whether biomarkers or neuroinflammation are altered by CBD.""

The $4.7 million that the Noorda Foundation is giving for the study represents the latest effort by the group to promote public health and welfare. Noorda has donated money for everything from higher education to youth services to hospitals.

Noorda is partnering on its support to UC San Diego with the Wholistic Research and Education Foundation, a La Jolla, Calif.-based group that promotes research and education about medical marijuana, particularly CBD.

The foundation is run by Andy Noorda and Pelin Thorogood, who said in a joint email to the Union-Tribune that, ""CBD has its controversies as there are companies that make unproven health claims, and their products may not even contain the ingredients or concentrations they advertise.

""The federal designation of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug is one of the primary enablers of this problem. Unlike other substances whose use may increase risk or lead to abuse, such as alcohol or tobacco, currently there are no set standards for manufacturers. Nor are there clear guidelines for the public as they make choices regarding if, when, and how to use cannabis safely for therapeutic purposes.

""Our goal is to change this paradigm with research-driven, scientific data, while also supporting the establishment of standardized testing and regulation to ensure that available products are indeed what they claim to be."""

(Photo: Jeremiah Graves, jgraves@stcloudtimes.com)

One man. One mission. One homemade dwelling that's seen more of the nation than most people have.

Lawrence Scible, 59, better known as Ras Ible, is aiming to take his mission to the doorstep of the White House.

After being released from parole about 14 months ago, Ible flew from West Virginia to Spokane, Washington, and gave up everything he owned to embark on his journey.

Ible says he was convicted on a charge related to marijuana possession, and now his mission is to promote nationwide legalization of medical marijuana. He says he suffers from PTSD, bipolar disorder and a digestive disorder and that cannabis helps all of it. He started his travels in April 2015, pulling a home that he likens to a rickshaw.

Two thousand miles later, the Navy veteran stopped Tuesday in Sauk Rapids, where he spent the night in a Holiday gas station parking lot to take cover from possible storms.

But stormy skies are the least of the hardships Ible has had to overcome. After he got out of prison, he struggled to find a job, food, a home.

""So I started protesting. I went on city streets with signs, went in front of the federal courthouse ... and basically said, 'Please, I need this medicine. I'm doing this to help end prohibition,"" Ible said of his war to support medical marijuana.

The man behind the mission

While incarcerated in West Virginia, Ible says he studied the law and worked out religiously.

""The last three years I wore paths around the perimeter of the fence. They would laugh at me and I was like, ‘I’m going to walk the United States. You never know.’ And here I am. It’s amazing.”

Ible noted that ""22 veterans commit suicide every day,"" and believes cannabis could help.

""Cannabis is not the problem,"" he said. ""It's the meth, it's the narcotics, it's the alcohol.""

Suit and tie. Ible's mother Rose Scible was pretty strict when it came to when it came to church and Sunday school at Weems Creek Baptist Church in Annapolis, Maryland.

""I was raised a Baptist,"" Ible said. ""Southern Baptist, just as hard as they come. But my mom taught me to be an equal person. She worked in a hospital. She cared for whites, blacks, Asians, it didn't matter.

""We're all one, and that's how I was raised by her.""

Rose was a combat veteran, a registered nurse, a commander of the American Legion in the 1960s, according to Ible.

When Rose was 40 years old, she died from cancer.

Ible was 10.

""Our world kind of turns upside-down when momma's gone,"" Ible said. ""She was a beautiful woman and I'm doing this in hers and Jesus' honor.""

When Ible built his farm, he and his wife split and she stayed in the city. And when he was incarcerated, he said he lost his 5-year-old daughter, whom he hopes to reconnect with after reaching the White House.

""I'm going to go look for her, find her and tell her 'I'm sorry,' "" Ible said fighting tears. ""I built it to be a family farm, so I could raise her ... it's hard.""

The journey so far

Ible says he’s pretty sure he’s the first person to pull a rickshaw through Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and, now, Minnesota.

His route, he estimates, is around 3,000 miles. Ible says he averages about 20 miles a day, and when conditions are right, that number can go up.

Along the way, Ible has dealt with law enforcement stopping him for concerns of his safety along major interstates and highways, and reminding and informing him of regulations on obstructing traffic. Patrol officers blocked his entrance to California on a major highway, and Washington patrols redirected him to a secondary road.

Speeding vehicles are Ible's main concern when it comes to safety.

""I've had cars collide right next to me; trying to take pictures and looking at this thing when they should be driving,"" Ible said. ""I'm getting hit by shrapnel and all sorts of stuff when those accidents happen.""

Acts of kindness aren’t foreign to Ible, as his Facebook reach continues to grow.Strangers across the country donate food, money and shelter.

While driving home Tuesday, Tammy Willenbring, 49, of St. Cloud, saw Ible along Highway 10. She was curious.

""He's a vet, and I have several vets and military members in my family,"" Willenbring said. ""Some friends that I've had died in the military. I have family that's been injured in the military.

""It's important to me. It hits home.""

Willenbring, a special education paraprofessional in Royalton, offered food, a place to stay and donations to Ible, in an effort to support the journey.

Ible has found time to make charitable donations to others as well.

In Salem, Oregon, Ible built and gave a home like his to a homeless, 60-year-old, one-eyed man, he said.

“I used my (Supplemental Security Income) money and built him one on the side of the highway and then in a Lowe’s parking lot when they kicked me off,” Ible said. “It was a beautiful thing to see the tears in his eyes and the love and the joy of this man finally owning his own home.""

Homemade, Earth-powered

Ible's portable home is 4 feet wide, 10 feet long and 7 feet tall. It's 500 pounds of canvas and wood, and it balances in a way that keeps it moving without much assistance.

Ible, a wrestler in high school, stands 5-foot-6 and weighs a ""solid"" 125 pounds. When he's pulling his home, he takes advantage of gravity and wind power to help lighten his load.

""I grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, so I’m kind of familiar with sailboats,” Ible said. “You try to always follow the river, whenever you can, or the train trestles … because our ancestors always tried to take the flattest route.”

Sometimes flat is not possible.

“It was quite a travel coming across the Continental Divide with this thing, because the shoulder was only like a foot wide and this thing is 4-foot wide,” Ible said. “It was difficult trying to get traffic to share the road.

""Now I’ve got all kinds of special lights on this thing, and a few times I’ve had to shake my fists.”

Stocked with food, a cooler, an electric cooktop, maps, cards, tools, a citizens band radio, clothes, bedding and bathroom and hygiene essentials, Ible ""doesn't need to stop for much.""

He was able to build the home because a preacher helped him develop his carpentry skills, ""just like Jesus.""

Its walls are covered with painted designs, quotes from historical figures such as Henry Ford and current activists such as the group Anonymous. There are trinkets, souvenirs, signatures and, of course, his message.

He saves items found along the road. A BMW car decal. Tools for emergencies.

""I left all my other ones behind ... because I wasn't expecting to come on a journey like this,"" Ible said. ""I've found wrenches, screwdrivers ... you'd be surprised what you can find on the side of the road.""

While the VA considers him a homeless veteran, Ible sees things differently.

""I have this shelter. I’m not underneath a bridge or anything,” Ible said.

""It keeps me sheltered from the rain. I can lay fully out, lay down, sit down and it’s totally human- and Earth-powered.""

Next stop?

Ible plans to continue down U.S. Highway 10 and cut through Minneapolis.

He plans to go through Madison, Wisconsin, and then Chicago, Illinois.

Ible hopes to go to the Great Lakes where he went to boot camp, but says he doubts they'll let him on the base while he's towing the home.

From there he says it's a straight shot on U.S. Highway 30 toward Washington, D.C.

That route crosses Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland off of his list.

While he's shot videos during his trip, Ible plans on making a documentary of his mission.

“I’ll have as many miles as Lewis and Clark by the time I’m done,” Ible said. “And I’ve actually walked most of their trails.”

Ible says once he gets to D.C. he'll decide how long he needs to stay there, because:

""I don't totally want live with the president.""

A 33-year-old St. Cloud man could face felony drug charges after officials confiscated 14 pounds of marijuana, 4 pounds of edible marijuana, 84.5 grams of cocaine and $11,000 from a residence in the 300 block of Third Avenue South on Thursday, according to St. Cloud Police Department.

Sonephet Khamluanglat was arrested Thursday morning after officers assigned to the Community Outpost Services and Campus Area Police Services units executed a search warrant. The warrant was the result of ongoing investigations into suspicious activity and suspected drug activity at a residence in the block.

Khamluanglat was present at the residence when the search warrant was executed. He was later booked in Stearns County Jail.

Khamluanglat has previous felony convictions for drug-related crimes.

It might appear that sooner or later states legalizing the use of marijuana, contrary to federal law, will be crushed in federal courts. After all, federal laws, according to Article IV of the US Constitution, are the supreme laws of the land and preempt state laws.

But wait. States, not the US Congress, are showing greater responsiveness to the will of the people — a core American political value. And James Madison's promise that states must be able to fend off unwanted federal initiatives has not been forgotten.

The successful passage of state marijuana statutes owe much to the 19th century-era isms that, to this day, define what it means to be an American. Most Americans accept that populism — the will of the people, individualism and deep suspicion of despotic, central governments are legitimate American political traditions.

With the expansion of suffrage and the use of ballot initiatives and referendum among states in the 19th century, citizens gained wider participation in the political process and populism — the belief that the will of the people should guide public officials — took hold. Opinion polls favoring legalization of marijuana have sparked a revival of populism in many states.

The Pew Research Center reports that 61 percent of Americans support marijuana legalization.

While European societies honored a class system calling for persons in lower social status to show deference to their social betters, 19th-century immigrants in America adopted more egalitarian values and a desire for personal liberty. In America each citizen was, and still is, free to conduct his life in accordance with his or her own conscience and to control his or her own destiny.

This tradition of independent thinking among our citizens no doubt accounts for the popularity of state marijuana statutes that grant personal freedoms and choice.

Rejecting powerful central governments in Europe, early American liberalism sought freedom from a strong federal state. This distrust of big government is still a force in American politics and, among other factors, fuels the widespread resistance to federal laws prohibiting the use of marijuana.

Resistance against federal marijuana laws is widespread. Minnesota is among the thirty states, representing 67 percent of the US population, that have authorized the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Nine states, representing 21 percent of the US population, and the District of Columbia, have also OK'd marijuana as a recreational drug.

To sell the new U.S. Constitution, James Madison argued more than 200 years ago that state governments should have the power to manage their own affairs. He wrote in the Federalist Papers, ""The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite... The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people...""

Madison would certainly agree that both the use of medical marijuana under a doctor's supervision, and the possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use by adults, are ""objects"" concerning""the lives, liberties, and properties of the people"" and are reserved for the states to decide.

Madison added, ""If an act of a particular State [legalizing marijuana, for example], though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that State,... The opposition of the federal government, or the imposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the State...""

On June 7 of this year, Madison's words echoed throughout the U.S. Congress when a bill titled, ""Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act,"" (aka the STATES Act),was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and U.S. Reps. David Joyce (R-Ohio) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) ""to ensure that each state has the right to determine for itself the best approach to marijuana within its borders.""

Senator Gardner added, ""This Act fixes this problem once and for all by taking a states' rights approach to the legal marijuana question.""

The bill is endorsed by more than a dozen organizations, including the Massachusetts Bankers Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Civil Liberties Union.

If it becomes law, this bill will not only revive the Founding Fathers' original view of how states should manage their own affairs, but will also remind us that traditional American values — individualism, populism and personal liberty — still matter.

This is the opinion of Ronald Fraser, Ph.D., who writes on public policy issues for the DKT Liberty Project, a Washington-based civil liberties organization. He can be reached at fraserr@erols.com.

Marine Corps veteran Ed Erdos tried medical marijuana to ease his pain, and found that it also eased his mind.

He enrolled with the Health Department’s Office of Medical Cannabis last year in search of relief from the pain and muscle spasms caused by injuries he suffered in a helicopter crash. But along with pain relief came relief from the anxiety, intrusive thoughts and fear that haunted him for years as a result of service-related post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It works,” said Erdos, who spent five years “bunkered,” barely able to leave his home. Now, when he visits the bright, airy lobby of the LeafLine Labs patient care center in St. Paul (there is also a location in St. Cloud), he wears a big smile under the brim of his Marine Corps hat. He no longer takes any of his old anxiety meds. He has the confidence to get out and visit his buddies at the American Legion and VFW.

The cannabis prescription the pharmacist hands him each week, he said, “has improved my quality of life to the point where I can function on a daily basis.”

Millions of Americans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Minnesota is the latest state to offer medical marijuana as a possible treatment option.

The Minnesota Health Department’s Office of Medical Cannabis opened enrollment to people diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder on July 1, and the state’s eight clinics will open their doors to those new patients in August.

Ten PTSD patients applied, and one had been enrolled in the program by the end of the first week, the Health Department reported. But some patients already enrolled in the program, like Erdos, noticed their pain medication had side benefits.

The cannabis oil, he found, offered swift relief to the pain that shot down his damaged spine and knotted his muscles so badly he sometimes dropped to the floor in agony. But Erdos found an unexpected side benefit to the medication the state legalized two years ago -- it seemed to ease the service-related PTSD that had trapped him in his home for nearly five years.

“The best part of PTSD treatment with medical cannabis is, it allows you to slow down. You don’t experience the anxiety attacks,” Erdos said “It allows you to think. It allows you to face some of those triggers that many PTSD victims are afraid to face.”

Erdos hoped that sharing his story would ease the stigma around medical marijuana for other veterans. But the federal government — and federal agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs — still considers marijuana a dangerous, illicit substance with no medical value.

“While some veterans use marijuana to relieve symptoms of PTSD, we believe more research is needed to fully determine the safety or effectiveness of medical cannabis for PTSD,” Larry Shellito, Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs, said in a statement that echoed the official policy of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

“MDVA is committed to treating veterans with PTSD,” Shellito added. “At this time we will continue to dialogue with our federal VA partners on this issue. However, there are no plans to move forward with this until more clinical research is available.”

The VA’s National Center for PTSD has warned that there is not enough clinical research to determine whether cannabis is a safe or effective treatment for people suffering in the aftermath of trauma. The Minnesota Medical Association has been leery of the medical marijuana program since it launched two years ago, although more than 900 doctors and other practitioners have enrolled with the Health Department to certify their patients to participate.

The federal ban makes it difficult for U.S. researchers to study cannabis’ effectiveness as a medical treatment. But Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger opted last winter to add it to the shortlist of qualifying conditions for the state’s program, noting that there are currently few other effective treatments available to help PTSD sufferers.

Twenty-two of the 27 states that have legalized medical cannabis include post-traumatic stress as a qualifying condition.

Minnesota runs one of the most tightly regulated medical cannabis programs in the nation. State law limits who can buy, sell and grow the drug, and in what form it can be dispensed. PTSD is the 11th condition added to the program, along with cancer, seizure disorders and intractable pain.

The Health Department is searching for public input about future conditions that should be included in the program. Past suggestions have included schizophrenia, autism and Alzheimer’s but so far this year, the office has not received any suggestions from the public. The office is accepting public petitions through July 31.

Despite the fact that there are just eight cannabis clinics in Minnesota, enrollment has climbed steadily, topping lawmakers’ modest estimates that 5,000 people might enroll in the program’s first year.

As of Friday, there were 6,226 active patients in the program.

That number includes Erdos. After years of struggling to even leave his home, he and his wife loaded their dogs into an RV and headed to the Mississippi Bluffs to go camping for the Fourth of July.

ST. PAUL — The chief executive of one of Minnesota's two medical marijuana manufacturers has left the company after years of financial losses.

Andrew Bachman, LeafLine Labs' co-founder and its chief executive since 2016, is no longer with the company ""in any official capacity,"" the company said Thursday in a statement to The Associated Press.

LeafLine opened a care center in June of 2016 in St. Cloud. It was the first care center LeafLine opened outside the Twin Cities.

Thursday's statement didn't give a reason for Bachman's departure, and a company official didn't immediately respond to questions. Bachman didn't immediately respond to a voicemail or text message seeking comment.

CLOSE LeafLine Labs on Wednesday opened the doors to its Cottage Grove facility to show off the place where medical marijuana is grown and processed into the liquid and pill form that will be available to qualified patients.

But LeafLine has struggled since medical marijuana sales began in 2015 in Minnesota. The Cottage Grove-based company lost $6.9 million in its first two financial years. Two top executives left LeafLine last year and it temporarily scaled back its operations in November during a supply shortage that Bachman blamed on lab testing delays.

LeafLine was founded and backed by several family members of the popular Minnesota nursery Bachman's Floral Garden and Gift Centers, though it's unclear if any family members are still involved at the company after Bachman's exit.

LeafLine was one of two manufacturers selected to grow and cultivate medical marijuana in 2014, the year Minnesota's Legislature passed its law.

The care center in St. Cloud opened in a strip mall on 33rd Avenue. Its pharmacists consult with patients to create specific formulas and calibrate ideal dosages for them. Patients who come to the St. Cloud store can register to pick up a supply for up to 30 days or get questions answered about their dosage, their equipment or registering.

Minnesota's program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form is banned, and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. Each manufacturer is required to perform several rounds of testing on their medication and must run four dispensaries across the state.

Those restrictions have made business difficult for both of the state's manufacturers. An audit last year showed the two companies, LeafLine and Minnesota Medical Solutions, had lost a combined $11 million in just two years of legal sales.

But LeafLine's losses have been worse, capped by a $4.7 million loss in 2016 alone. The company also struggled late last year with supply, turning away some patients and temporarily closing a storefront in Eagan due to what Bachman said was a delay in the state-mandated, third-party testing of its medication.

This isn't LeafLine's first brush with turnover. Bachman was the company's fourth chief executive since the company formed in 2014. He took over after Manny Munson-Regala, previously a top state regulator of the medical marijuana industry, left the company in 2016 after just eight months on the job.

Last fall, the company's chief medical officer and chief financial officer resigned, with Bachman citing ""personal and professional reasons.""

A medical marijuana distribution facility that has been approved to operate in St. Cloud is on track to open later this summer.

LeafLine Labs is one of two medical marijuana providers chosen by the state to manufacture and distribute marijuana in Minnesota. Some of the state's distribution centers will open July 1, with other locations opening later this year and next year.

LeafLine is planning to open a distribution facility in St. Cloud. It's application for state approval indicated its storefront would be at 125-33rd Ave. S.

""Our operation is, if anything, tracking slightly ahead of our original schedule,"" said Dr. Andrew Bachman, co-founder and chief medical officer at LeafLine. ""Our initial care center location in Eagan and a second facility later this summer was always our intent.""

He wouldn't say this week if the St. Cloud location referenced in the company's application is still where LeafLine plans to open or exactly when it would open. An announcement about the location will come closer to the opening date, he said.

For now, Bachman is spending plenty of time answering questions about how his company's medical marijuana operation will work.

The company is growing marijuana at a 42,000 square-foot facility in Cottage Grove, where plants will be harvested and the necessary components extracted to make liquid and pill forms of medical cannabis.

There will be no growing or manufacturing at the St. Cloud facility and there will be no leaves, buds or other plant forms of marijuana there either. It will operate more like a combination of a spa and a narrowly focused pharmacy, Bachman said.

Rather than an experience based solely on a transaction, LeafLine hopes to create an interaction between patient and provider that informs care, he said.

Patients statewide this week could begin getting their medical conditions certified to receive medical marijuana. That certification comes from the patient's healthcare practitioner.

Story continues below.

In CentraCare Health, the decision whether to certify patients is up to the individual physician, said Jeanine Nistler, director of communications.

A survey released this week by the Minnesota Medical Association showed that the vast majority of physicians who responded to the survey don't plan to participate in the state's medical cannabis registry.

The survey was sent Tuesday to more than 14,000 physicians, and 493 had responded by Thursday. Of the respondents, 9 percent said they plan to participate, 68 percent do not, 16 percent haven't decided and 7 percent said that they don't have patients who would have a qualifying condition, according to the MMA.

The state approved medical marijuana for people suffering from the following conditions: cancer associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting; glaucoma; HIV/AIDS; Tourette syndrome; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; seizures; severe and persistent muscle spasms; Crohn's disease; and terminal illness where the patient has a life expectancy of less than one year.

That means that many of the patients using the distribution center will be ""quite ill, will have failed with other therapies"" and might be near the end of their life, Bachman said.

""We want this to be safe, comfortable and spa-like to give patients comfort and a therapeutic experience,"" he said.

City officials didn't take a position on LeafLine's application to open in St. Cloud. Mayor Dave Kleis has previously said that there were no zoning concerns with opening the facility in the city.

The nature of the business and what they are selling raises some security concerns with St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson. He would like to know where the store is going and what the company is doing to make the store as secure as possible.

""Just because they're only going to have the extracted liquid form and pills doesn't mean that there won't be members of the public that either won't believe that or believe that it is just as valuable,"" Anderson said. ""What form it's in won't really matter that much to me in terms of needing to have the same level of security that I think is necessary for a business such as that.""

He mentioned a recent house fire that killed an elderly woman in St. Cloud and was allegedly started when two men were making butane hash oil from marijuana as a reason to be concerned about marijuana in any form.

Bachman said security at the manufacturing facility in Cottage Grove and the distribution facilities they open will be more than what's called for in state statutes. The Legislature is requiring closed-circuit television surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a week with cameras that are able to ""capture clear and certain identification of any person entering or exiting"" a manufacturing or distribution facility.

The company must retain the video for at least 90 days, according to state statute. They also must have an alarm system that covers the entire facility and works during a power outage.

""We have incredible state-of-the-art monitoring and security that would make a Las Vegas casino proud,"" Bachman said.

He anticipates involving services such as massage, yoga, acupuncture and other health and wellness treatments. He wants to create a care experience for patients that eliminates long wait times and crowded lines, he said.

""We want this to be peaceful, compassionate and dignified,"" Bachman said.

Central Minnesota patients who are approved to purchase medical cannabis for a qualifying health condition will no longer have to travel to the Twin Cities to buy it.

LeafLine Labs opened a care center Monday at 141-33rd Ave. S in a setting that resembles a salon more than a pharmacy. It's the first care center LeafLine has opened outside the Twin Cities, and it hopes to build upon what has happened at its original care center in Eagan.

""This location is about replicating exactly the success that we have in Eagan, and it's here so patients don't have to travel farther,"" said Dr. Gary Starr, chief medical officer and co-founder of LeafLine. ""And we anticipate that it will be one of the busier locations because it's centrally located in the state. We're trying to do the same great things in a place that is closer to home.""

LeafLine plans to open care centers July 1 in St. Paul and Hibbing.

CLOSE Medical cannabis store opens in St. Cloud

The care center in a strip mall on 33rd Avenue has pharmacists who have been training for months at the company's Twin Cities facilities. Those pharmacists consult with patients to create specific formulas and calibrate ideal dosages for them. Patients who come to the St. Cloud store can register to pick up a supply for up to 30 days or get questions answered about their dosage, their equipment or registering.

They can pay with cash or debit cards, but not credit cards, Starr said. Pharmacists behind secure glass windows provide information about what patients receive, when and how much.

The news that LeafLine was opening in St. Cloud brought hope to Mollie Garden. She, and her daughter Madeline, were featured in a St. Cloud Times story in July.

Madeline suffers seizures that cause her eyes to flutter and her head to jerk back. Mollie has traveled to Colorado and Minneapolis to buy medical cannabis in the hope of lessening or stopping the seizures. She has yet to find a medical cannabis product that helps, although she hasn't tried any of the LeafLine products.

She plans to visit the St. Cloud LeafLine location and work with its staff to try to find a solution for Madeline.

""The fact that they might have some other options gives me hope,"" she said.

The trip to downtown Minneapolis to visit the store of the state's other approved medical cannabis provider, Minnesota Medical Solutions, cost time, money for gas and to park and required her to find care for her four kids. LeafLine is about a 10-minute trip one way from her home in south St. Cloud.

""I just want to get in and build a relationship with the people there,"" she said. ""I've been waiting a long time,"" she said.

The results of an ongoing study released Monday by the Minnesota Department of Health show that most medical cannabis patients who completed the survey reported benefits from the medication.

About 90 percent of the 241 patients who completed the survey reported mild to significant benefits from medical cannabis. The health department sent the survey to the 435 patients who made their first medical cannabis purchases during the first three months of the program, July 1, 2015, to Sept. 30, 2015.

About 20 percent of patients reported side effects, none of which was life-threatening.

“These survey data are based on a small sample of patients and should not be confused with a clinical trial,” said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger, in a news release. “However, these results do highlight Minnesota’s data-focused approach to medical cannabis and the fact that patients are benefiting from the program.”

This summer, a new category of health condition will be allowed treatment with medical cannabis: intractable pain. The state medical cannabis registry has fewer numbers than anticipated, and adding patients with intractable pain is expected to dramatically increase those numbers.

""In almost of the states (that passed medical cannabis laws) prior to us, 75-90 percent of patients in their state are being treated for some version of chronic pain or intractable pain,"" Starr said. ""So the majority of their patient pool has chronic pain as an underlying condition.""

The dangers of over-reliance on opiates for chronic pain has come to the forefront recently, particularly with the death of Prince.

Opiates for pain became over-prescribed, and people became dependent and needed more to fight back the pain.

Medical cannabis isn't nearly as addictive as opiates and isn't associated with the same risk of respiratory side effects and death as long-term opiate use, Starr said.

""Prescription opiate use is a problem that is obviously getting a lot of coverage right now,"" Starr said. ""This is a potential aid or a potential solution. It's certainly one of the things in the toolbox that should be considered.""

The state-approved medical marijuana provider for the St. Cloud area plans to open its dispensary in St. Cloud the first week of June.

LeafLine Labs has a certificate of occupancy to move this month in to a storefront in a strip mall near 33rd Avenue and Second Street South that used to be home to Hollywood Video, said Dr. Andrew Bachman, LeafLine's chief medical officer.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, LeafLine plans to have a grand opening ceremony in June, he said.

""I know there are a lot of people in St. Cloud that need (medical marijuana),"" Bachman said. ""And we feel we're going to be in a great position to help them.""

LeafLine has a growing and production facility in Cottage Grove and a store in Eagan where people can purchase medical marijuana if they've been approved to do so.

Statewide, 1,324 patients have been approved to pick up medical cannabis, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. That's well below estimates that indicated that number would be closer to 5,000 by now.

Bachman believes that opening additional stores could cause more people in outstate Minnesota to inquire about medical marijuana and apply to be added to the state registry of approved patients.

""Once a month people are driving four, four-and-a-half hours to get to us because ... other medications didn't work,"" he said.

He plans to engage the public in educational sessions in the St. Cloud area about his products and to dispel misinformation about medical marijuana.

Every 30 seconds, there's a storm in 17-year-old Madeline Garden's brain, as her eyes flutter and her head jerks back. That's how her family describes the seizure disorder she's lived with for most of her life.

""It's just a split second, but if you're watching her, you'd notice something,"" said her mother Mollie Garden.

Since Madeline was 3 years old, they've been trying to find ways to lessen or stop the seizures — medication, diet changes and brain surgery.

""We had done everything we can think of to try,"" Mollie said.

That includes establishing residency in Colorado, so Madeline could try forms of medical cannabis. Mollie became an advocate for legalizing marijuana for medical uses in Minnesota, for conditions such as epilepsy or Lou Gehrig's disease.

On Wednesday, cannabis dispensaries open in Eagan and Minneapolis based on a 2014 bill legalizing medical marijuana in pill or liquid form. Six more are tentatively opening later this summer, including LeafLine St. Cloud Care Center at 125-33rd Ave. S.

In the months leading up to the July 1 dispensary launch, the Minnesota medical community still had a lot of questions about what the program would mean. With medical cannabis, a doctor does not write a prescription but certifies that a patient has the condition covered by the law. Pharmacists with the program then determine the type of treatment and dosage.

CentraCare and HealthPartners clinics allow their providers to qualify patients if they want.

But that's not an option for providers working at St. Cloud Hospital, said Dr. Mark Matthias, St. Cloud Hospital's vice president of medical affairs. Because marijuana is still illegal by federal law, the federal agencies that certify hospitals don't recognize the state law allowing medical cannabis.

HealthPartners is still developing a system to assess patients for the program, said Patrick Strait, senior communications consultant

Dr. Arthur Wineman, department head of family medicine at HealthPartners and regional medical director, said many providers are free to join the registry but many are waiting to see how things go.

""There's very low evidence that it can help some patients, but on the other hand, the risks associated with use are fairly low,"" he said.

HealthPartners hopes to work with the state to coordinate research on medical cannabis.

Wineman said this change is unlike many others in medicine, in that it's political and has a lot of emotion surrounding it. He's also surprised by how many patients don't consider marijuana an illegal drug. He suspects doctors may be more comfortable as they see patients who have benefited.

""It seems to me ... more like same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""There was a strong opinion one way that changed fairly rapidly.""

Adding to the confusion is a tight timetable, as the state finalized details as late as May.

Small studies have shown medical cannabis to be effective, but research has been limited because of marijuana's legal status, said Dr. George Morris, medical director for CentraCare Clinic.

Across the state, 203 medical professionals were registered as of Tuesday to qualify patients for the program. As of Tuesday, 65 patients were registered to pick up medical cannabis Wednesday.

Many medical professionals are ""not willing to be the first person to be trying this,"" Morris said. They want to make sure the experimental treatments are safe and effective.

Morris and Matthias expect CentraCare could re-evaluate its policies in three to six months. And during that time, they'll collect data on safety and efficacy.

The Minnesota Hospital Association has been working closely with hospitals and health care systems on what Morris describes as the most controversial health care issue he has witnessed.

People have also been looking to a small number of health systems in Minnesota that are researching with medical cannabis, like the Mayo Clinic, despite the inconsistencies between state and federal law.

If the Garden family chooses, they could seek out a doctor to register Madeline as a patient with a qualifying condition.

Madeline, who loves Spider-Man, the Minion movies and her dog Cooper, functions rather highly, Molly explains. She's able to walk, bike and run, and plays baseball and hockey. But the constant interruptions in her brain have left their mark. Developmentally, her brain functions like a second- or third-grader.

It's not a leap to figure out why: Imagine if your train of thought was interrupted every 30 seconds, Mollie said.

So Madeline is impulsive and has a lack of focus. She can be loud. She has a hard time with the concepts of money and time. But she also loves her place on the Miracle League baseball teams, and makes her family laugh.

""She's frustrating, but entertaining,"" Mollie said. And because of Madeline, Mollie says her three youngest kids are learning patience, and a sense of humor.

Over the years, the family has tried different kinds of medication, diet changes and brain surgery.

""When ... medical cannabis came up, we did our research and decided to try,"" she said.

So the family established residency in Colorado, where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use.

""We're not some ... people giving our kids weed and smoking up,"" she said. ""We're not trying to hurt her in any way. But we are willing to try these things.""

Now, the family has oil derived from the marijuana plant on hand. Mollie injects capsules with the oil, which Madeline takes morning and night.

And still, they're not sure if it's helping. With marijuana, and with seizures, it takes a lot of trial and error.

""There's so many variables to take into consideration,"" she said. They're hoping they just haven't found the right dose. There's also another extract from the plant they could try. They also know that every person's seizure disorder is a little different, and treatment is individualized.

The Garden family is still hoping to see some relief for Madeline. If they have to move to Colorado again to try another form of medical cannabis not allowed in Minnesota, they will. But they'd rather not, with Madeline's three younger siblings in area schools and their jobs here.

""There are a lot of unknowns. I hope nobody abuses the system,"" Mollie said. ""We've been fighting this battle for so long. We're open to anything.""

Who qualifies?

To receive medical cannabis, a doctor must certify that a patient has one of nine specific medical conditions:

•Cancer associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia (severe wasting).

•Glaucoma.

•HIV/AIDS.

•Tourette syndrome.

•Lou Gehrig's disease.

•Seizures, including those characteristic of epilepsy.

•Severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis.

•Crohn's disease.

•Terminal illness, with a life expectancy of less than one year, if the illness or treatment produces severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, cachexia (severe wasting).

Patients then register with the state Department of Health and pay a $200 annual fee. After each visit to a dispensary, they must submit an online self-evaluation form before they can get more medicine.

275,276,MN,www.mndaily.com,http://www.mndaily.com/article/2016/10/u-reflects-changing-national-drug-trends,"U reflects changing national drug trends, slump in high-risk drinking","Colleges around the country, including the University of Minnesota, have seen a drop in drinking paired with more marijuana use.

While alcohol use has declined at the University in the past decade, marijuana use continues to rise despite a lack of smoking in those under 18. However, national and area experts still don’t know for certain what causes this trend.

High-risk drinking at the University has decreased nearly 10 percent since 2001. The total number of students consuming alcohol fell about 6 percent in the same period.

There aren’t many anti-drug or alcohol outreach efforts at the University, said Dave Golden, Boynton Health public health and communications director, adding the pushes are often ineffective with students.

“We don’t reach out and say ‘hey we have these services’ because that doesn’t work. People need to be able to find these services when they need them … really most of what we see is referrals where they’ve gotten into some level of trouble,” Golden said.

Beyond AlcoholEdu — the online program on alcohol use required for new students — there are few to no prevention efforts on campus, but some groups like Student Legal Services are looking to start new programs.

There is no punishment for students who don’t complete the AlcoholEdu program, Golden said.

He said, to his knowledge, that there are no campus programs specifically targeting drugs other than alcohol. But if a student is caught violating a drug policy, they are placed in a program designed to help them rather than punish them.

Any student who gets a checkup at Boynton is given a series of questions which can cause them to be sent to a drug counselor, Golden said.

Alcohol prevention efforts at the University are directed by the Alcohol Abuse and Prevention Committee.

The University tries to help students in trouble with alcohol or marijuana use after the fact. SLS refers students to alternative punishment methods — like community service — that don’t leave a mark on their permanent record, said Mark Karon, the University SLS director and APAP committee member.

Citations for underage drinking have also dropped over the past few years, Karon said, but this is likely due to 2013’s medical amnesty law, which grants immunity to those who call 911 for alcohol overdoses, rather than a drop in drinking.

He said SLS and the University of Minnesota Police Department have educated University community advisors in residence halls on medical amnesty during their training.

Meanwhile, marijuana use has risen since 2007 both nationally and at the University.

While fewer people under 18 smoke marijuana, total use has grown, with more than an estimated 22.2 million people using the drug in the last 30 days.

Researchers are unsure if marijuana affects alcohol trends, said Kimberly Johnson, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration director.

Some studies show marijuana replaces alcohol use, but others show they are used together, Johnson said.

She said she thinks young people are using marijuana less because of national prevention programs, which delay the age people start using the drug.

“Delaying is good,” Johnson said. “Every year you can delay use … is preventing future substance abuse.”

ThanhVan Vu, a Boynton drug counselor, said she’s seen cases where a social drinking environment triggers a student to try marijuana for the first time, which could lead to future use.

“I would suspect that we’re going to see more and more cases of marijuana … and I think my colleagues would agree with that,” she said.

Most students sent to counseling have violations, Vu said. But those sent for marijuana use often don’t see it as a problem and often consider it a solution to personal distress.

276,277,MN,www.mndaily.com,http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/07/ptsd-cannabis-treatment-hurdles,"PTSD patients offered cannabis treatment, but hurdles remain","Next month, Minnesotans with post-traumatic stress disorder will be able to register for cannabis-based therapy.

Minnesota is now the 25th state to recognize PTSD as a cannabis-treatable condition after the Office of Medical Cannabis opened registration July 1, and patients will start receiving the medication Aug. 1. Experts say conflicts in the medical community may still prevent widespread treatment.

“I think people who are open-minded will look at this as another tool in the toolbox for patients,” said OMC Director Michelle Larson.

To register for treatment, Larson said patients must be certified by a physician.

Patients will then be directed to a patient care center, where they can get prescriptions from one of the state’s manufacturers, Leafline Labs or Minnesota Medical Solutions, a Vireo Health company. The prescriptions are refillable on a monthly basis.

Though the process itself is straightforward, Larson said, many barriers still exist to those with PTSD seeking care.

The first hurdle is simply education, said Sarah Overby, medical science liaison for Minnesota Medical Solutions.

Despite the limited care available to PTSD patients, few are aware medical cannabis is a treatment option, and few physicians actually suggest it, she said.

Even if a patient is aware of the therapy, getting certified by a physician is complicated.

Gary Starr, chief medical officer at Leafline Labs, said doctors hesitate to certify patients for medical cannabis due to a lack of understanding of the drug, internalized biases against it and worries that their reputation will suffer from repeated certifications.

This division in the medical community has and will continue to make certification for PTSD communities especially difficult, Starr said.

Most notably, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, a main medical provider for a community widely affected by PTSD, has historically prohibited doctors from certifying patients for medical cannabis, he said.

If this trend continues, veterans seeking care may be forced to get certification from someone other than their primary physician, which complicates the process, Starr said.

To address this disconnect in the medical community, Larson and Overby said their teams are doing outreach to give medical professionals the cannabis education they didn’t get in medical school — due to the drug’s legal classification, it has not been included in standard curriculum.

Starr said physicians should also understand cannabis’ positive side effects.

PTSD patients often turn to self-medication due to the lack of official resources available to them, he said.

“The reality is that a lot of people with PTSD are using street marijuana right now, and if they do, they don’t know what’s in it,” said Thomas Arneson, research manager at OMC.

Overby said official therapy could also help self-medicating PTSD patients ditch dangerous self-medications like opioids and alcohol.

Despite these challenges, Larson said she’s hopeful the new expansion will continue to improve the lives of Minnesotans.

“This is my first time in public health where I’m seeing people’s lives actually changing,” she said.

You completely failed to mention the Legal Marijuana Now Party candidates, namely Susan Pendergast Sindt in the 4th congressional district and Dennis Schuller in the 5th congressional district. Their names are on the ballot and votes for them will be counted.

Minnesota has the strongest third party history of any state, going back to the Greenback, the Prohibition, and the People's parties in the 1800s.

Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party nominee Theodore Roosevelt carried Minnesota in 1912. Ninety years ago, Minneapolis had a Socialist mayor. In the 1930s, numerous Farmer-Labor Party candidates were elected to Congress, Senate, and governor's office. (The Farmer-Labor merger with the Democrats in 1944 formed what is still known as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party).

In 1992, Reform Party candidate Ross Perot polled well over 20 percent of the Minnesota vote for president, and in 1998 the Reform Party's Jesse Ventura was elected governor.

Minnesota defines major parties as those receiving 5 percent or more of the statewide vote, and the Green Party and Independence Party both had major party status in recent years along with the Republicans and DFL.

Third parties don't typically succeed in electing candidates, but they serve to introduce new or controversial political issues and may help dissolve political stagnation or dislodge political gridlock.

You owe it to your readers, as well as to candidates Schuller and Sindt, to correct the oversight in your Election Guide.

The results are based on an online survey of 1,361 people who may participate in the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program, MDH said.

The survey showed 70 percent of people would likely participate in the medical marijuana program, compared to 7 percent who do not plan on registering, according to the press release.

Over half of the survey respondents said they receive government aid like Social Security disability or Medicaid, MDH said.

Medical marijuana will become available to patients beginning July 1 from eight dispensaries statewide, the release said.

Up to 5,000 patients could be eligible to receive medical marijuana, according to MPR News.

The release says the sample is not representative of all medical marijuana users in Minnesota."
279,280,MN,www.mndaily.com,http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/03/eagle-magic-and-joke-store,The oldest joke shop in the U.S. is right here in Minnesota — and it's still going strong,"Situated in Burnsville, the “oldest magic shop in America” has all the supplies necessary to craft the perfect April Fools’ Day.

The rows of shelves and showcases in Eagle Magic and Joke Store are full of everything from Chinese linking rings and snake cans, to mysterious tubes and decks of cards.

While the hundreds of items may seem daunting at first, the store’s owner, Larry Kahlow, has helped anyone and everyone from behind the counter since 1971.

""I've had many hundreds of thousands of conversations with people regarding this stuff,” Kahlow said. “It's fun to see people that I started out [in tricks] 46 years ago still being interested in this. I start someone out every day.""

Having worked at the shop for nearly five decades, Kahlow doesn’t just sell tricks — he teaches how they work. He provides mentorship to those who want to learn, which is something you can’t always get at other joke shops or online.

""I'm helping you with the how-to and the real thing,” he said. “I'm a magician.”

But don’t go into the store expecting to learn all of magic’s greatest secrets. Kahlow will likely start beginners off with tricks like Hot Rods or Cups and Balls, which are both under $15. He won’t sell tricks to people who aren’t ready for them.

Carter Jones / Minnesota Daily Larry Kahlow shows a boy different gag gifts to give out at his birthday party in Eagle Magic and Joke Store on Friday, March 24, 2017.

While Kahlow said anyone can do magic, being successful at it is just like learning to play the piano — you have to start with the basics and respect the art’s process.

“You can get three or four things and pull them off,” the 66-year-old said. “It doesn't matter when you get started being interested in magic tricks, but the sooner the better.""

At 10 years old, Kahlow would frequent Eagle Magic when it was located in downtown Minneapolis. The beginner magic kits, snake cans, joy buzzers and whoopee cushions had him hooked. Five years later, he was putting on his own magic shows and making money for himself.

""By the time I was 15 I knew what I was going to do, and I did it,” Kahlow said. He started working at the store soon after and has only learned more since.

Kahlow has been with Eagle Magic through many location and inventory changes. One thing, however, has stayed the same: the shop’s success.

Eagle Magic’s reputation has allowed Kahlow to hang out in the shop with Muhammad Ali, get to know former Gophers football coach and frequent customer, Lou Holtz, and sell over 200 stink bombs to ZZ Top’s lead vocalist, Billy Gibbons.

Despite a lack of advertising and a relatively small sign outside the store, he said magic is a self-sufficient enterprise. Those who are interested find their way down there.

""People don't listen to advertising for tires unless they need tires,"" he said. ""When someone needed to do something, Eagle Magic Store was known for having the Groucho glasses or having a big, foam cowboy hat or large toothbrush.”

For 118 years, Eagle Magic and Joke Store has been one of the best place to go for magicians in the Twin Cities. If they need something of the magical variety, they go to Kahlow.

Where else would they go if they need one, 18-inch, red, silk handkerchief?

“They come here to get it,” Kahlow said.





Erica Beebe | Minnesota Daily ""I don't have a boat. I don't have a cabin. I don't have leather pants. I don't smoke marijuana. I just want this stuff,"" says Larry Kahlow, speaking fondly of the wide array of magic tricks available in his store, Eagle Magic.

280,281,MN,www.mndaily.com,http://www.mndaily.com/staff/jessie-bekker,Jessie Bekker |,"The University of Minnesota’s Delta Upsilon fraternity chapter was suspended Friday after a member alerted international representatives about multiple sexual assaults committed by members in the last two years. Delta Upsilon’s international offices notified the University’s chapter by email Friday of the temporary suspension for “serious violations of the Fraternity’s ideals and principles.” The email didn’t specify the nature of the violations. The chapter was ordered to cease all operations until an investigation is completed, according to the email. Fraternity officials suspended the chapter four days after it was told by a member of the University’s chapter that the Minnesota Daily had learned of issues — which included multiple sexual assaults — within the house, said Dawson Kimyon, physics senior and the member of Delta Upsilon who reached out to the fraternity’s headquarters. At least three sexual assault reports involving Delta Upsilon members were investigated by the University in the last two years, according to sexual misconduct data obtained through public records requests. Two Delta Upsilon members were sanctioned by the University last spring for committing the three sexual assaults at chapter events in the spring of 2015. One member was expelled from the University after he was found responsible by the school for committing at least two sexual assaults that year."
281,282,MN,www.mndaily.com,http://www.mndaily.com/article/2016/09/u-athletics-aware-of-drugs-in-december,U athletics department knew of drug problem months before taking action,"Evidence suggests a University of Minnesota Athletics Department administrator and several staff members knew of at least one wrestler using and selling drugs as early as December 2015 — about three months before a University internal investigation said the department and wrestling coaches became aware of a drug problem on the team.

Senior Associate Athletics Director Marc Ryan sent an email on Dec. 7, 2015 to former wrestling head coach J Robinson, current interim head coach Brandon Eggum, assistant coach Luke Becker and trainer Rich Schlotfeldt alerting them to an unspecified incident possibly requiring further investigation by a University athletics drug and alcohol committee, the University of Minnesota Police Department’s investigation file shows. The files were obtained by the Minnesota Daily through a data request.

That same day, an email sent by Ryan suggested he “had known that the unlawful use, sale, or possession of drugs was a problem for at least one student,” according to an examination of electronic records completed on behalf of UMPD. The email referenced in the electronic records report was completely redacted by the University.

And communications from that day reference ""'orange pills' possessed by one student,"" though the sender of those messages isn’t included in the heavily-redacted report.

But Ryan told police he was ""first informed that there was suspected drug activity on the wrestling team"" in mid-March according to documents detailing the investigation into the sale and use of Xanax by University wrestlers.

The University first learned of the problem in early April through an anonymous report, triggering a police investigation of the drug ring, according to the findings of a school investigation released the same day Robinson was fired.

The University’s official report admits to staff-wide knowledge of the drug problem in March, but it doesn’t mention that evidence suggested Ryan and other staff knew months earlier.

Coaching and athletic department staff purposely limited electronic communication, according to the examination of electronic records completed for UMPD.

“Several messages indicate that coaching and athletic department staff wished to keep their electronic communication limited,” the electronic records report noted.

Robinson’s University email account showed no activity throughout most of March.

“The only way that there would be no activity in an email account is if the user deleted all of the emails,” University Information Services told police investigators.

A University Athletics spokesman declined to comment for this story.

Culture of troubling behavior

Robinson was fired Sept. 7 after the University determined that he refused to cooperate with attempts to investigate his team’s drug problem to shield members from consequences for selling and distributing Xanax, a prescription anti-anxiety medication.

Robinson had coached at the University for nearly 30 years, guiding the team to three national championships.

The University disclosed letters of apology written by four of 14 accused wrestlers. The letters detail accounts of theft, gambling and fighting by team members. A team-wide drug test showed three members tested positive — one for marijuana and two for amphetamines.

But the drug test — scheduled two days after the end of the wrestling season — did not test for Xanax. Wrestlers were informed after the test was administered that it would not check for the drug at the center of the criminal investigation.

Though Robinson offered amnesty to wrestlers who self-reported to him, University attorney Brent Benrud said in a letter to Athletics Director Mark Coyle that it was unlikely the wrestlers met the self-reporting requirements of the Safe Harbor program, a voluntary disclosure process that protects students who admit to drug use from being tested.

The Drug Testing Review Board determines whether athletes meet the Safe Harbor requirements, though the policy does not cover students involved in the sale of drugs.

The anonymous University wrestler who tipped off the investigation said a teammate showed him video evidence of wrestlers receiving ""500-1000s"" of pills by mail from a former wrestler who transferred to Old Dominion University in Virginia.

In February 2016, Old Dominion staff found him passed out in a study area with a firearm in his backpack. He is no longer a student at the school.

A University Office of the General Counsel document showed that several team members turned in drugs to Robinson, including Xanax, marijuana, Adderall and oxycodone — to which Robinson said, “Holy shit, I did not think you had this much.”

Wrestlers either declined or could not be reached for comment.

Leaders of the drug ring accused of selling or taking drugs were first- or second-year wrestlers. All of the first- and second-year wrestlers lived in the 17th Avenue Residence Hall.

Police led an investigation into hundreds of package receipts for mail sent to the residence hall.

Four team members were named as the distributors of the drug.

Every one of the 14 wrestlers named by the anonymous reporter as users or sellers of the drug are listed on the school’s 2016-17 wrestling roster.

So why are so many people using it?,"An aesthetician, Franklin started working with an Oregon chemist last year to make CBD products for the skin, believing that a little of it swiped onto the face could help repair the ravages of age.

But Franklin also takes CBD in gummy form, popping some in the morning and some at night. Like a magic pill, she says, it wipes away the sleeplessness and the stress and the nagging pain in her back that has left her with a slight limp, though she's only in her 30s.

""It's crazy,"" she acknowledges. But she insists that CBD can do it all. ""It's just crazy, the different things that it has helped.""

For Generation Anxious, affixed to its phones and stricken by news alerts, overworked and under-rested, the mysterious substance known as CBD is quickly becoming the new ""it"" drug.

Devotees whisper about CBD as a soothing remedy for racing thoughts and aching extremities. CBD for those restless nights. Also, somehow, CBD for those listless mornings.

Suddenly, you can find sugar-coated CBD gummies to gnaw on, and balms to rub onto pulse points. There's CBD for your dog (gluten-free and pumpkin-flavored!) and CBD for your aching feet. You can buy bottled CBD water in trendy, seasonally-driven fast-casual restaurants, and bags of CBD-laced coffee in shops on busy thoroughfares in Washington, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas and dozens of other cities.

Back at Joy's, Osorio, the mask still plastered on her face, pipes up about her own experience with CBD, how it seemed to quiet the back spasms she has suffered since an accident years ago.

Plus, is it just her imagination, or do her wrinkles seem to have faded?

Have we mentioned CBD's relationship to the green gold mine that is the American marijuana industry? (Surprise.)

Also known by its full name, cannabidiol (pronounced canna-bid-EYE-ol), CBD is just one of hundreds of compounds hiding within the cannabis plant. It's a distant cousin of THC, the stuff in pot that's notorious for getting you stoned and for inciting the wrath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

But while the term ""cannabidiol"" smacks of weed, ""CBD"" somehow sounds . . . tame. Like something you can name-drop around Mom, like turmeric and melatonin and charcoal and biotin or any of the other wonder-elixirs that have replaced Prozac in America's medicine cabinets.

The dizzying rise of CBD is a story of timing as much as of branding. As more states deregulate marijuana, the Reefer Madness stigma that surrounded it for decades seems to have gone up in smoke.

But here's why CBD appeals to some who would never smoke a joint after dinner: Take a few milligrams of CBD as, say, an oil slipped onto the tongue or a piece of candy, and it tastes unmistakably like cannabis, which is to say, slightly minty and herbacious, and just a little funky. But cannabidiol's effect is startlingly anti-climactic. It's weed without the high.

And this may be why CBD is legal in many states, including several that don't allow legal recreational or medical marijuana.

An organic chemist named Roger Adams isolated cannabidiol amid a wave of research into the medicinal promise of marijuana in the 1930s and '40s. He filed for a patent, and in the decades that followed, marijuana growers experimented with raising plants with high levels of CBD and almost no THC, hoping that a puff might trigger its own trippy bang.

It didn't take long for them to realize that they were wrong. So, so wrong.

""CBD became known as the hippie's disappointment,"" says Stuart W. Titus, the chief executive of Medical Marijuana Inc., a producer of several CBD oils and products that entered the market in 2012.

Now, the hippie's disappointment is back, rebranded as the stressed-out modern office drudge's salvation.

Gwyneth Paltrow's obsessively followed lifestyle site Goop, never one to miss a chance to gush about a wellness trend, recently published a guide to CBD cocktails. One of the many cushy lounges offering swag at Coachella next month is promising CBD oils, along with yoga and vegan food, for all its guests. A writer for the website the Cut wrote that a little CBD made her feel ""delightful.""

""Some people do want the high, of course,"" Titus says. ""But others are looking for the health and wellness benefits.""

Which, according to the charter members of the Cult of Cannabidiol, are many. Infinite, in fact.

""I like to call it the super-nutrient, the super plant,"" says Spike Mendelsohn, the Washington-based former ""Top Chef"" contestant behind fast-casual restaurants including Good Stuff Eatery. More recently, he's a partner in the CBD-infused ""wellness drink"" Plnt Water, which comes in such flavors as turmeric and ginger, and matcha and mint and, for now, is available in a healthy-leaning fast-casual restaurant chain.

""It's really mother's milk,"" he says. ""It's natural.""

Naturally, not everyone is buying the hype.

Last year, the FDA dinged a number of companies hawking CBD based on unsubstantiated claims - mainly that it could cure or reverse cancer.

The agency hasn't evaluated all the claims around CBD, but some in the research field already have their doubts.

""I think you're dealing with disease states where people are grasping for answers,"" says Timothy E. Welty, a professor of pharmacy at Drake University in Des Moines. ""So they're turning to this and saying, 'This is the answer.' ""

Welty has been involved with CBD use in patients with epilepsy, and at least two reputable studies have shown it can relieve seizures. But as for the rest of it - the anxiety and sleep claims, all anecdotal - he's doubtful. ""They're not scientifically founded, in my mind,"" he says.

So: Is CBD just this year's activated charcoal or functional mushroom? Harmless enough to pop without worry?

""I would be very cautious,"" Welty says. With no oversight of the candies and waters and food products containing CBD, he says, ""you're not sure what you're really getting.""

For true believers, though, it's worth venturing into the unknown if it means tossing out the aspirin and the painkillers and the anti-depressants.

""For a long time now, there have been people approaching a lot of chefs about working with cannabis and edibles,"" Mendelsohn says. Weed seems like fun. ""But is it worth risking all the other work that I have? I'm in business with my family. I do a lot of work with kids. I do a lot of work with policy.""

Drugs? Unwise. The wellness space? Whole different ballgame, he says. Plus, there's no question there's a market for CBD. ""People,"" he says, ""are already buying it.""

Franklin is convinced of its powers. ""I've had friends take CBD for the first time, and call me and say, 'Where have you been all my life?' "" she says.

""They've got to find a way to inform people.""

When Mullen's fiancee, the late Linnea Stephan, was fighting brain cancer, they sought a prescription for medical marijuana to counter the nausea caused by chemotherapy, he said. But they couldn't find any oncologist at either Essentia Health or St. Luke's Hospital in Duluth willing to certify her for that condition.

Unable to find a certifying provider in Duluth, the couple turned to a Twin Cities clinic.

""It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in Duluth, but that's part of the problem is how would I find out?"" Mullen asked. ""How would I know who it would even be?""

There's no provider directory on the website of the Minnesota Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis. The department ""cannot say"" what providers are in the registry, said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the cannabis office.

That came as a surprise to the Health Department's boss when she was asked about it during a visit to Duluth last week. ""That's a new one on me, that we don't do that,"" said Jan Malcolm, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed as health commissioner in late January.

Different hospitals, different approaches

Patients may find more difficulty obtaining medical marijuana certification at certain hospitals.

At St. Luke's, oncologists are the only practitioners who are on the registry, said Dr. Gary Peterson, the hospital's chief medical officer. That's not to say that an oncologist would necessarily agree to certify a particular patient.

""I would think that each individual cancer patient ... would be evaluated individually as to the appropriateness of medical marijuana,"" he said. ""We wouldn't expect that to be the first-line treatment.""

But the decision about whether to certify patients is left up to the practitioners, Peterson said.

Essentia Health takes a more centralized approach. Dr. Jeffrey Lyon, an internist who is on the medical cannabis committee at Essentia, said practitioners are asked to try ""evidence-supported treatments"" before considering medical marijuana as an option. If the clinician then wants to recommend medical marijuana, he or she first must refer the case to the committee, which then rules on whether the patient can be certified.

An expedited process is allowed for terminally ill patients with ""intractable nausea,"" he said.

Lyon has led the committee since the beginning of the year, and there hasn't been a single request during that time, he said.

Arneson said he senses frustration from prospective patients in the Duluth area.

""We get complaints about not being able to find (a practitioner) to certify a patient from all over the state, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""But we have received a number from the northeastern part of the state with specific complaints about organizations.""

The cost

Income may be a factor in holding down the number of participants from some parts of the state.

""Most people can't afford this program,"" Arneson said. ""That's just the reality of it. So it depends a little bit on the distribution of income, I would say.""

The average monthly cost for marijuana patients in Minnesota is $150, Dr. Adam Locketz said.

Locketz is a practitioner for TimeWise Clinic, which operates in Duluth and Lake Elmo, Minn. He has certified close to 2,000 patients for medical marijuana, some referred from larger clinics.

But there are other costs before the patient even gets to the marijuana distribution center, especially in the first year. Locketz said he charges $250 for the first visit to certify a patient, with declining rates after that. The state charges another $200 to place the patient on the registry, and then $50 every succeeding year. A patient must be recertified each year.

The costs and the hurdles have created a problem for the state's medical marijuana program, Lyon said.

""The state has created this system, and they're not seeing the number of people buying their product that they had hoped for,"" he said.

Nonetheless, state data shows growth in the patient registry every month since the program started accepting patients in June 2015. The curve became steeper starting in August 2016, when intractable pain became a condition for which marijuana could be prescribed.

As of March 31, 9,435 patients were enrolled and in active status in the registry, the Office of Medical Cannabis reported. That was up from 5,119 a year earlier.

Nearly two out of three Minnesota patients who received medical marijuana are certified for intractable pain.

Those patients may be able to break their dependence on opioids, Locketz said.

""Daily I'm seeing patients back who, over a period of years, have been able to use this to come off of fentanyl patches or oxycodone,"" he said.

But while data coming from states with legalized medical marijuana shows a trend toward lower opioid use, Lyon said there's still a lack of quality clinical research in the field.

""Maybe medical marijuana will be a significant tool in decreasing opioid abuse,"" he said. ""We just don't know.""

""We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia's parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl.""

After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a.

According to an article from early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly.

Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session.

Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014.

Legalization didn't take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state's two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing.

By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents.

A photo of Angie and Amelia Weaver was featured on the LeafLine Labs website, with a link to their story and more pictures.

But Amelia was still a sick girl with a compromised immune system. She suffered setbacks and hospitalizations, including an anxious drive to the Mayo Clinic on Christmas Day 2015.

She recovered slowly, but suffered additional setbacks and last Sunday was airlifted to the Mayo Clinic, her parents reported on Facebook. ""Sadly, Amelia is in very rough shape,"" they told friends and family last week.

The Weavers said on Facebook that details for a celebration of Amelia's life will be announced within the next few days.

Hibbing is 75 miles northwest of Duluth."
302,303,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/crime-and-courts/4410236-regional-drug-task-force-sees-rise-marijuana-heroin,"Regional drug task force sees rise in marijuana, heroin","""We had not seen fentanyl in our task force area until last year,"" said agent Robert Braness.

Information on numbers and trends was shared in a recent report to the Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners.

The task force, which has been active since 1990, coordinates multi-jurisdictional drug investigations in Chippewa, Kandiyohi, Meeker, Swift and Yellow Medicine counties.

Its agents made 387 arrests last year. Marijuana accounted for the majority of drug seizures — 72 pounds with an estimated street value of $137,000.

Ten pounds of methamphetamine and over 900 prescription pills also were seized during arrests carried out last year by the task force.

Heroin seizures totaled 15 grams, an increase from the year before, Braness said. And in a first, an arrest last year led to the seizure of a gram of fentanyl, the potent narcotic behind a growing number of opioid-related overdoses and deaths in Minnesota.

Although heroin has emerged as a significant problem in other areas of the state and the U.S., it has been slow to reach this region.

""We have been somewhat sheltered,"" Braness said.

But he noted this has begun to change. Over the last couple of years, ""we've been seeing it on a more frequent basis,"" he said.

He and task force commander Ross Ardoff outlined some of the trends occurring in the five counties covered by the task force.

Restrictions on sales of Sudafed, an over-the-counter cold remedy containing an ingredient that can be turned into crystal meth, have led to a decline in home manufacture of methamphetamine, Ardoff said. ""We don't see meth labs like we used to.""

But the price of methamphetamine has dropped significantly in recent years, leading to larger amounts of meth being seized during execution of search warrants, he and Braness said.

For example, a search warrant executed in New London last summer resulted in the seizure of two pounds of meth and a six-year prison sentence for a man convicted of first-degree drug possession.

More needles are being found, an indication of deep addiction, Ardoff and Braness said.

Polydrug use also is becoming more common — for example, a marijuana user might also be using prescription pills and/or meth.

While the region has experienced a slight decline in meth activity, marijuana-related drug seizures have been on the rise. Concentrates such as butane honey oil, a homemade extract of THC, the main active ingredient in marijuana, are becoming more prevalent, Braness said. ""It's fairly new to our area but it is here and we're running into it on a monthly and weekly basis.""

Drug dealing and use often hit families hard. Ardoff and Braness said 70 children — 39 in Kandiyohi County alone — were removed from their homes last year because of drug use by adults in the household.

In an especially worrisome development, firearms increasingly have been turning up in conjunction with drug seizures and arrests. Property forfeitures stemming from drug-related investigations last year by the task force included 51 guns, Ardoff and Braness said.

In one case, a grenade was found along with numerous firearms, Ardoff said.

And in a high-profile case earlier this year, nearly four dozen handguns, rifles, shotguns and submachine guns, along with homemade silencers, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and suspected explosives, were found during the execution of a drug-related search warrant in rural Willmar."
303,304,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/nation/4475592-does-legal-weed-make-police-more-effective,Does legal weed make police more effective?,"""Our models show no negative effects of legalization and, instead, indicate that crime clearance rates for at least some types of crime are increasing faster in states that legalized than in those that did not,"" the authors write in a study published in the journal Police Quarterly.

A crime is typically considered ""cleared"" if authorities have identified and arrested a suspect and referred him to the judicial system for prosecution. The Washington State study examined clearance rates for crimes in Colorado and Washington from 2010 through 2015, using monthly FBI data.

To isolate the effects of legalization, the researchers looked at how the trends in clearance changed after the implementation of marijuana legalization in November 2012 in Colorado and December 2012 for Washington. While recreational markets in these states didn't open until 2014, provisions allowing for personal possession and use took effect shortly after the votes were certified.

Clearance rates were falling in both states before legalization. Afterward the decline stabilized in Colorado and began to reverse itself in Washington. The authors note that no similar shift happened in the country as a whole.

The researchers stress, however, that the data can't prove conclusively that legalization directly caused the changes in clearance rates. There could have been other changes to policing in those states during that time period, such as increased use of overtime hours, the implementation of new policing strategies or a more aggressive focus on certain types of crime.

They note, however, that no other major changes to public policy happened in those states that would affect clearance rates in the way they observed. ""We think the argument that legalization did in fact produce a measurable impact on clearance rates is plausible,"" they conclude.

Property crime clearance rates show a dramatic reversal in Colorado, with a brief boost in Washington followed by a continuation of the prior trend.

The authors also looked at trends for some specific types of crime, most notably burglary and motor vehicle theft. ""The clearance rate for these two offenses increased dramatically postlegalization,"" the authors found. ""In contrast, national trends remained essentially flat.""

Going beyond simple visual comparisons, the authors ran a number of statistical tests that largely confirm the findings hinted at in the charts: ""While there were both immediate and longer term differences between states which legalized and the rest of the country in terms of crime clearance rates, the long-term differences are much more pronounced, especially in Colorado.""

Advocates for legalization have frequently argued that freeing police from the burden of low-level marijuana enforcement would allow them to devote resources to more serious crimes. The Washington State researchers say their findings support this idea: ""Our results suggest that, just as marijuana legalization proponents argued, the legalization of marijuana influenced police outcomes, which in the context of this article is modeled as improvements in clearance rates.""

They note, furthermore, that ""there were no crime types in either state for which legalization appeared to have a negative impact on clearance rates.""

305,306,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/4408850-legalization-growing-elsewhere-marijuana-makes-half-nd-drug-arrests,"With legalization growing elsewhere, marijuana makes up half of N.D. drug arrests","In North Dakota, more than 50 percent of the drug arrests have involved marijuana for several years, according to the Attorney General's Office. Arrests have been on the rise in the state, and it appears large busts are becoming more common.

A large concern is people may not realize recreation use of marijuana isn't legal in North Dakota, Grand Forks Police Deputy Chief Jim Remer said. The U.S. is made up of what he called a ""patchwork"" of marijuana laws—some completely outlaw marijuana use, many have legalized medical marijuana and a handful allow recreational use.

""We don't have those laws in place that make it legal in other states,"" he said of recreational use. ""I think at times people can get very frustrated over that because they maybe don't understand that or think, 'It's legal there. It should be something that is OK here.' That's just not the case.""

A group of North Dakotans hope to change that as they gather signatures to put a legalization measure on the November election ballot. The measure would fully legalize marijuana in North Dakota and would require the state to expunge any marijuana convictions from anyone's record who has been convicted in the state.

Proponents argue North Dakota is ready for recreational use, and decriminalizing it would free up law enforcement officers to focus resources on other criminal activity, said Josh Dryer, campaign manager for the group behind the measure, Legalize ND.

""The main thing is there is a market for marijuana in the state,"" he said. ""We either are going to get it from the cartels, we are going to get it from the other states that have legalized it—all of that trafficking would come down if it were legal within (North Dakota).

But until that happens, law enforcement officers plan to enforce the laws as they stand, and people should be aware of each state's laws before using, Remer said.

""Obviously, we don't make the laws. We just enforce them,"" he said. ""Whatever those laws may be, we'll be making sure we are enforcing those appropriately.""

Large busts

Eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational use of marijuana, while Vermont and Canada have approved laws that would see users lighting up possibly in July. More than half the states, including Minnesota and North Dakota, have approved legislation to allow the use of medical marijuana to some extent.

Several large marijuana busts have made headlines in North Dakota. The Stutsman County Sheriff's Office seized 476 pounds of pot last month near Jamestown and another 200 pounds in December. Authorities found another 286 pounds of weed in November in West Fargo. In Bismarck, a 71-year-old man was arrested on charges of hauling 183 pounds of marijuana through the state.

Closer to home, two UND students were charged with possessing marijuana with intent to deliver after officers found 60 pounds of pot, large amounts of cash and a rifle in November at their home at 1611 Fourth Ave. N. Mark Charles Hildahl, 20, pleaded guilty Feb. 5 in Grand Forks District Court to the Class B felony and was sentenced to 130 hours of community service. Cade Matthew Hoben, 21, has a court hearing March 15 in relation to the bust.

The larger amounts of marijuana seized by the North Dakota Highway Patrol appear to originate from outside North Dakota and are destined for other states, Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Roark wrote in an email.

""North Dakota Highway Patrol troopers do a great job enhancing the public's safety across the state,"" he said. ""Troopers take their responsibility very seriously and work hard to protect and serve the citizens of North Dakota.""

Rising numbers

Arrests related to marijuana in North Dakota have increased every year since 2009 from 1,533 to 3,362 arrests in 2016, according to Attorney General's Office data.

The State Highway Patrol has followed the same upward trend for the most part. It reported 852 marijuana arrests in 2012 compared to 1,382 marijuana arrests last year, or an increase of 62 percent in five years, Roark said.

The only decline in the last six years was from 2015 to 2016, when the state agency made 1,339 and 1,338 arrests, respectively.

The Highway Patrol meets with other state patrol agencies in the U.S. each year to ""discuss best practices"" when it comes to marijuana enforcement, he said.

""We will be reaching out to those agencies where recreational use has been legalized to determine the amount of increased workload law enforcement faced with the change,"" he said.

The Grand Forks Police Department typically doesn't separate marijuana arrests when compiling total numbers for controlled substances, but it does track the number of ""green leafy substance"" confiscations each year. Those numbers have been on the rise almost every year too, from 139 items in 2012 to 269 confiscations in 2017, Lt. Brett Johnson said.

The steady increase could be due to various reasons, Remer said. His department gets reports of marijuana use throughout the community, and officers use their own discretion in making arrests, he said. Those arrests would go away if North Dakota legalized recreational marijuana, he acknowledged.

""It would be a change, obviously, but we would handle that change as we have to,"" he said.

What wouldn't change is enforcement at U.S. international borders. Selling, possessing, producing and distributing marijuana still is illegal by federal law, Border Patrol Agent Jesse Lindemer wrote in an email to the Herald.

""Consequently, crossing the border with marijuana is prohibited and could potentially result in fines, apprehension or both,"" the Grand Forks Sector spokesman said.

Canadians could have legal access to recreational marijuana as soon as July, but travelers wouldn't be allowed to bring it into the U.S.

""U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the laws of the United States,"" Lindemer said. ""Further, CBP is responsible for determining the admissibility of individuals based on the requirements of U.S. immigration law, which may include inquiries regarding the individual's past conduct.""

The Border Patrol's Grand Forks Sector tends to have a limited number of marijuana confiscations by pounds. According to annual sector profiles, the Grand Forks Sector confiscated a pound in fiscal year 2015 and 9 pounds in fiscal year 2014. The other fiscal years from 2012 to 2017 yield zero pounds, according to Border Patrol data."

The law will not take effect until it receives royal assent - a final ceremonial stage of the legislative process - and the government sets a date for legalization.

On Wednesday, Trudeau announced that marijuana would be legal on Oct. 17. He had hoped to make cannabis legal by July 1, but Canada's provinces and territories said they needed eight to 12 weeks to make final preparations before they would be able to sell cannabis to consumers.

Trudeau heralded the vote in a tweet, saying, ""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that.""

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who sponsored the legislation, tweeted that the Senate vote was a ""historic milestone for progressive policy in Canada.""

The law makes Canada the second country after Uruguay to have a nationwide, legal market for marijuana.

It grants the federal government the power to license and regulate a restricted group of cannabis growers but gives Canada's 10 provinces and three territories the discretion to decide how to sell and distribute the drug. Some, like Ontario, will sell it at a small number of state-run stores operated by the provincial alcohol monopoly. Others, like Newfoundland and Labrador, will sell it to consumers at select grocery stores.

The legislation sets the minimum age for purchase at 18 and allows for the personal possession of up to 30 grams for dried cannabis, with rules on edibles to come later. Those caught selling marijuana to a minor could face stiff penalties of up to 14 years in jail.

Like tobacco, producers trying to market their product face strict advertising rules. Cannabis can only be sold in plain packaging that is a single, uniform color and free of flashy graphics or images.

Canadians spent more than 5.7 billion Canadian dollars on marijuana in 2017, with the majority of it for recreational use, according to a Statistics Canada report released in January. That makes cannabis a multibillion-dollar industry that is larger than the tobacco industry and as large as the beer industry.

Bill Morneau, Canada's finance minister, said that he expects the government to rake in nearly 300 million Canadian dollars from the taxes on legalized cannabis. The provincial and federal governments will split the excise tax revenue 75-25 for the first two years after legalization.

One of Trudeau's first major policy pledges as leader of the Liberal Party was to legalize marijuana, a promise that became a central pillar of his party's 2015 federal election campaign. When his government introduced Bill C-45 in April 2017, its backers framed it as an effort to discourage consumption among youth, while also crushing the illegal market.

In a news conference after the legislation was introduced, Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief who was an architect of the legislation, said, ""Criminal prohibition has failed to protect our kids and our communities.""

And while public opinion polls show Canadians have widely supported legalization, introducing the legislation was the easy part for Trudeau's government. The bill has been the subject of more than a year of fractious debate and games of legislative ping-pong between the Senate and lawmakers in Canada's lower house of Parliament.

Conflict between the two groups flared last week when lawmakers rejected 13 amendments that the Senate added to the bill, including a contentious one over whether provinces could ban home cultivation. The Senate eventually deferred to the government's position of allowing Canadians to grow up to four marijuana plants in their home.

Even after Tuesday's vote, the government is left with a long to-do list. A second piece of legislation that would change impaired driving laws and give police new powers to carry out roadside intoxication tests has not yet been passed. Questions remain, too, over whether to grant amnesty for past marijuana convictions and over how strictly police forces should crack down on growing cannabis at home.

The legalization of marijuana in Canada has implications for cross-border relations with the United States. Under the law, it will remain illegal for Canadians to take cannabis across the border into the United States, just as it will remain a criminal offense for Americans to bring cannabis into Canada.

Leonard Saunders, an American immigration lawyer in Washington state, testified before a Senate committee that Canadians could be denied entry to the United States even after cannabis is legalized because it is still considered illegal at the federal level in the United States.

""I see a wall on the northern border,"" he said, adding that Canadians could face more scrutiny at the border if they admit to having smoked cannabis.

But Ralph Goodale, Canada's public safety minister, told the Senate that his message to Americans is that ""this should not be an issue.""

""It becomes an issue if you make it one, but there's no need to make it one because the border rules have not changed,"" he said.

(AP) — A Massachusetts medical marijuana dispensary has created a culinary delight for patients who don’t want to smoke their pot or eat it in the form of sweets.

Quincy-based Ermont Inc. has been selling cannabis-infused pizza for about three weeks to rave reviews.

Director of Operations Seth Yaffe says the company has a whole range of marijuana edibles, but he wanted to offer meals that patients could eat without a lot of sugar.

The 6-inch cheese pizzas sell for $38 apiece. The tomato sauce contains 125 milligrams of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. The company has sold about 200 already. Yaffe says if patients want toppings, they can add their own.

Only people with state-issued medical marijuana ID cards are eligible to buy the pies."

THERMOPOLIS – With the legalization of marijuana and marijuana-based products in neighboring Colorado, Wyoming has seen an influx of non-plant contraband, including edibles and oils, often found in candies, sodas and baked goods.

While the state currently has no law governing the prosecution of edibles, or a definition of standard weights for prosecution, and past legislation has failed to be passed due to wording and a broad scope, the House and Senate Joint Judiciary Committee took up the topic on Thursday in Thermopolis, to hear from a wide variety of witnesses regarding future legislation which would regulate the products.

“We are seeing things we’ve never seen before [in Powell] from candy and vaporizers to oils, which are hard to detect,” said Powell Chief of Police Roy Eckerdt, testifying before the committee. “We’re kind of being left to hold the bag while the weight of this bill [to set criminal penalties for edibles] is being debated.”

While Chief Eckerdt noted that the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, has found to be higher in the candy and liquid form, it still does not meet the states definition of marijuana as being “a leafy plant or parts.”

Wyoming Chief Deputy Attorney John Knepper Jr. testified that the state should determine the appropriate levels of THC for prosecution, before the federal government sets a mandate.

“We need to dete rmine THC levels which would make possession a felony, relevant for state prosecutors to deal with it at a state level without federal intervention from the federal system,” said Knepper. “We are fortunate, however, to have a cooperative relationship with federal law enforcement, for now.”

Byron Oedekoven, executive director for the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, noted that the state currently defines marijuana as any part of the plant, but with no way to test for THC in edibles, they don’t fall under the definition. Oedekoven recommended to the committee that the legislature first define marijuana, before trying to determine penalties for an undefined product such as edibles.

Senator Larry Hicks (R-Baggs) suggested the committee could change the definition to include any compound derived from the plant, but warned that the danger in creating a new definition is that too many loopholes already exist on the subject.

Frank Latta, state director for the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML), urged the committee to go slow, and not be in a rush to define penalties when loopholes already exist, creating a budget crisis in the legal system. “I don’t believe this is a public safety issue,” said Latta, noting that THC has not been proven to be toxic, as compared to opioids or other scheduled drugs.

Representative Nathan Winters (R-Thermopolis) challenged Latta’s contention that THC is not dangerous, referencing an increase in emergency room visits in Colorado, and an increase in traffic accidents associated with drivers under the influence of marijuana.

“No one has ever died from THC,” remarked Latta.

“You can talk about revenue increases in Colorado all you want,” said Winters, “but Peter has been robbed to pay Paul … as a matter of fact, he’s been flogged.”

“We can play ping pong all day, but I don’t want to do that,” replied Latta. “The fact remains: we have seen no deaths from THC or edibles or anything else.”

At the conclusion of public comments, Chairman Leland Christensen (R-Alta) noted that the committee has several more meetings on the topic ahead, and that there were simply too many concepts to consider, but that redefining marijuana was a good approach to further creating a set of laws to prosecute the possession of edibles.

“Quite frankly,” said Senator Hicks, “we need a more measured approach to this.”"

The Sublette County Sheriff’s Office says state and local police searched the farm on Aug. 25 on a warrant after receiving information about marijuana being grown at the site.

The office says officers confiscated about 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) of processed marijuana, about 300 marijuana plants and more than $63,000.

The search resulted in felony drug charges against three individuals."

Worland Chief of Police, Gabe Elliott told the council, at its regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday night, that the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police (WASCOP) is raising awareness of the drug in response to states legalizing marijuana.

Colorado citizens voted to legalize marijuana during the 2012 election.

According to information provided by WASCOP, the goal of the project is to ""inform the citizens of Wyoming as to the harmful personal and societal effects of marijuana.""

According to a statement released by WASCOP, Wyoming residents are becoming de-sensitized and/or disbelieving of the dangers of marijuana use. Marijuana use/dependence is the No. 1 reason kids are admitted to substance abuse treatment across the nation.

During the meeting, Elliott advised the council of the consequences of marijuana use.

""It's a gateway drug. It's definitely harmful to our society, in my opinion,"" Elliott said.

Elliott said, with the city's endorsement of the anti-marijuana campaign, state legislators would see that municipalities throughout Wyoming have condemned the drug.

Councilperson Dennis Koch voted for the measure.

""Obviously, there are going to be some people who are not going to be thrilled with us opposing marijuana, but I think it's time for communities and governments to take a stand,"" Koch said.

At a meeting in February, law enforcement and school officials warned the community about the dangers of marijuana use. Elliott said there is a ""new generation of users"" in today's world.

Elliott also warned about the new methods of marijuana use.

Dabbing is ""the new form of marijuana smoking,"" according to Elliott.

""Butane oil is used to extract the THC out of marijuana. The high is more intense; the duration is longer and we're seeing a lot of ill effects from it,"" Elliott said, adding that people don't realize how much THC they are injecting.

Marijuana can also be ingested through dabbing, Elliott said.

""It changes the whole game of what we're seeing these days. Now, they eat a full brownie and bad things happen,"" Elliott said.

According to the information released by WASCOP, the negative consequences of legalization in Colorado include a 26 percent in youth (ages 12 to 17 years of age) monthly marijuana use.

Also listed as a harm in the report, the number of pets poisoned from ingesting marijuana has increased six-fold. Traffic fatalities involving operators testing positive for marijuana have increased 100 percent in Colorado.

The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) lobbies legislators for legalization of marijuana for both medical and recreational use.

Wyoming Chapter Director Chris Christian called WASCOP's report false.

""It is nothing but false-faced propaganda with no supporting evidence presented,"" she said, citing the claim marijuana use has increased 26 percent by youth.

""This is directly in contradiction to every published report there is. I want to know where they got this data, and I want to see it. This is unsupported hearsay. I'm way pissed off about the way they're going about doing this,"" Christian said.

The report also delves into the ways marijuana is consumed.

""Marijuana is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints) or in pipes or water pipes (bongs). It is also smoked in blunts – cigars that have been emptied of tobacco and refilled with a mixture of marijuana and tobacco.

""Marijuana is associated with a higher likelihood of dropping out of school. Several studies also associate workers' marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers' compensation claims and job turnover."""

LARAMIE — A new survey asked Wyomingites for their opinions on a number of hot-button issues facing the Wyoming Legislature this session — including public lands, marijuana, “stand your ground” legislation and separation of church and state.

While many of the proposed bills relating to these issues have already failed, others are still in play, and Brian Harnisch — a senior research scientist with the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center — said the survey could provide valuable information to state lawmakers.

“A lot of time, at the state, what we hear is anecdotal evidence about what constituents may or may not feel, so what we wanted to do is provide a tool that can actually … say, ‘This is what the citizens of Wyoming as a whole feel about these issues,’” Harnisch said.

While most surveys conducted by WYSAC take weeks or months to complete, the 2018 Legislative Session Survey of Wyoming Citizens was fielded in four days, gathering responses from 694 survey completions, while using an online probability-based panel of respondents called WyoSpeaks.

Harnisch said the panel ensures everyone in Wyoming has an equal chance of being asked to participate.

“The WyoSpeaks panel is a tool we’ve been developing for almost two years now — the idea being that we build a probability panel of Wyoming citizens to enable us to do these fast-turnaround, low-cost, web-based surveys that produce statistically valid results,” he said.

Though the legislative-issues survey is the first publication based on the WyoSpeaks panel, WYSAC has performed “test runs” before.

“We’ve tested the panel — against our scientifically-rigorous telephone survey results for the same questions — to make sure that we got results that were statistically valid and comparable to those really robust, scientifically rigorous methodology questions,” Harnisch said.

He added he hopes the survey and future similar surveys will be used by state legislators to gauge public opinion. Given the quick turnaround time and low cost of WyoSpeaks panel survey, Harnisch said the survey could be deployed more frequently and maybe even multiple times throughout the year.

“As we develop this — this is still in its infancy — I’d like to have more of a partnership with the Legislature,” he said. “(If) we know about some issues that might be coming up, we can actually get a bit of a head start and try to get this information out to the Legislature as a service to them to make sure they’re informed about what the citizens of the state actually feel about the issues.”

Public lands

The survey found Wyoming residents were divided on issues related to the transfer of public lands, with 43 percent saying they support the transfer of federal lands to the state and 41 percent saying they oppose. There was a similar split on whether the state could financially handle the management of land being transferred.

However, a majority of residents — 71 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to raise revenue for the management of remaining lands, and an even greater majority — 76 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to reduce budget deficits.

More than half — 55 percent — agree the state could do a better job of managing public lands in Wyoming than the federal government.

A plurality — 47 percent — said they would support an amendment clarifying how the state would handle public lands transferred from federal to state control. House Bill 131 — which speaks to this issue — failed introduction Feb. 14.

Marijuana

A majority of residents — 70 percent — support medical marijuana and oppose jail time for minor possession convictions, but residents are divided on issues of recreational marijuana, according to the study.

A plurality — 49 percent — said they oppose allowing adults to legally possess marijuana for personal use, while 43 percent support it.

A proposed house bill seeking to establish penalties for edible marijuana products failed introduction one day before the survey period began, but a senate file providing for similar penalties has passed the Senate and been referred to committee in the House.

The survey finds residents are divided on the issue, with 33 percent saying they support a bill with such penalties but 37 saying they oppose such a bill.

‘Stand your ground’

Senate File 71, which would introduce “stand your ground” legislation to state statute, has considerable support in the Legislature. Sponsored by Sen. Anthony Bouchard, R-Cheyenne, the bill has 22 co-sponsors.

The bill also has support from a majority — 62 percent — of residents, according to the study. Senate File 71 was passed by the Senate Wednesday and referred to committee in the House the next day.

Cryptocurrency

House Bill 70 — which would enable blockchain token, or cryptocurrency, trading in Wyoming — has citizens divided, with 18 percent saying they support it and 29 percent saying they oppose it, and more than half refusing to take a side — 28 percent of survey respondents say they neither support nor oppose it, while 25 percent say they don’t know or are not sure.

The bill was passed unanimously by the House and passed second reading in the Senate on Thursday.

‘In God We Trust’

A proposed bill requiring classrooms, school libraries, the state capitol building and other state-owned or leased buildings to display “In God We Trust” passed in the House and has been referred to committee in the Senate. A majority of Wyoming residents — 54 percent — said they support the bill, while 30 percent said they oppose it.

Stalking laws

House Bill 8 — which would increase the punishments for stalking and was passed by both chambers — is supported by 83 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study.

Taxes

The study polled respondents on a number of tax proposals brought before the State Legislature this session, though the most popular bills are already dead.

A majority of Wyoming residents — 71 percent — said they support increasing the cigarette tax, while 70 percent supported increasing the tax on moist snuff. A bill doing both failed introduction Feb. 16, the day the survey began.

A bill increasing the tax on alcohol — supported by 64 percent of Wyoming residents — similarly failed introduction. The Legislature also killed a statewide lodging tax supported by a majority — 53 percent — of Wyoming residents.

A wind energy production tax hike, which divided residents, is also dead. While 40 percent of respondents said they support the bill, 34 percent said they oppose it.

A tax cut for the oil and gas industry — which is supported by 51 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study — is still alive, having passed in the Senate and referred to committee in the House."
