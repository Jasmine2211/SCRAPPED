0,0,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-angell-marijuana-democrats-20180712-story.html,Democrats still haven't figured out that legal weed is a winning issue,"Every Democratic U.S. senator rumored to be considering a 2020 presidential run supports marijuana legalization. So do 77% of Democratic voters. The party's 2016 national platform backs states’ rights on cannabis and calls for a ""reasoned pathway for future legalization."" 
So why is the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — the entity charged with winning back control of the U.S. House — attacking a Republican congressman over his support for marijuana reform? And why is it citing a right-wing magazine to make the case? 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Costa Mesa) has a ""cult-like fixation on marijuana,"" said a National Review article excerpt the Democratic committee highlighted in a tweet posted Monday. The party organ said the GOP congressman's cannabis advocacy is one reason ""why [Democratic nominee] @HarleyRouda needs your help flipping this seat...from #RedToBlue."" 
Rohrabacher has played a leadership role in beating back the federal government's outdated and harmful marijuana prohibition policies, serving as the chief sponsor of a successful amendment that since 2014 has prevented the Department of Justice from arresting cancer patients who use medical cannabis under state laws. 
Democratic leaders need to take a look in the mirror and recognize that their own members broadly support marijuana legalization. 
There are a lot of reasons why Democrats and progressives would wish for Rohrabacher to lose his reelection fight, aside from the fact that “flipping this seat from red to blue” could make the difference in determining which party controls the House come January. But marijuana is not one of them. 
The Democratic committee could have highlighted Rohrabacher's position that homeowners should have the right to refuse to sell property to gay people — something mentioned by National Review in the same sentence as that cannabis quip. Or his position on climate change. Or healthcare. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who has cosponsored many marijuana measures with Rohrabacher, told me in an emailed statement that the campaign committee’s tweet was ""stupid,"" adding that he expressed those sentiments directly to the organization itself. 
The problem goes beyond a “stupid” tweet. While Democrats in Congress are more likely to back marijuana reform than Republicans, party leadership has been slow to embrace the movement to end prohibition. 
In 2016, Hillary Clinton didn’t endorse legalization, instead adopting the Obama administration’s “hands off states” approach. It’s worth pointing out that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein — who both campaigned on legalization — earned more votes than the margin between Clinton and Donald Trump in key states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. During San Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s four years as House speaker, moreover, Democrats only allowed one floor vote on Rohrabacher’s medical cannabis amendment. Republicans, on the other hand, allowed annual votes in the four preceding years and after regaining control of the chamber in 2014 and 2015. (They have since moved to block nearly all marijuana measures from consideration). 
The future of marijuana is legalization, in more states and federally. It’s a galvanizing issue for either party that fully embraces it first. Attacking opponents for their efforts to reform cannabis laws might have been a shrewd tactic in 1988 or 1994, but it’s a political loser in 2018. It will alienate the young, progressive voters Democrats need to form a blue wave in November. Millennials overwhelmingly support legalization. 
But it's not just young voters, or Democrats. California's marijuana legalization measure, Proposition 64, passed in Rohrabacher’s Orange County congressional district by a 54.1% to 45.9% margin in 2016. 
Nationally, 57% of Republicans back legalization, as do 62% of independents, according to an online poll by the Center for American Progress and GBA Strategies. Rohrabacher’s challenger, Harley Rouda, doesn't seem to fully grasp the new politics of marijuana, either. The only two times he has tweeted about cannabis were to attack Rohrabacher's advocacy. 
He did, however, write a Facebook post on the 4/20 unofficial cannabis holiday, saying that ""people should not be going to prison for possession or use of marijuana."" Notably, that post linked an article about historically drug-war-loving Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announcing his intent to file a far-reaching marijuana bill. 
Now that even Schumer and Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado — who is responsible for his party's 2018 effort to defend GOP Senate control — are on board, it would be a mistake for Democrats not to go all-in on cannabis. 
Surely the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn’t trying to send the message to voters that President Trump, who announced his support last month for cannabis legislation filed by Gardner and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is more progressive on marijuana than a leading Democratic political organization? 
Even Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has evolved this year — amid a reelection challenge — from vigorously campaigning against medical cannabis in 1996 and opposing state protections in Congress to finally supporting the right of Californians to get high without fear of harassment by the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Democratic leaders need to take a look in the mirror and recognize that their own members broadly support marijuana legalization. And then they need to look at the polls and realize that attacking Republicans for supporting cannabis reform is a great way to remain the minority party.

1,1,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-marijuana-status-20180423-story.html,"Marijuana growers, manufacturers have yet to get the green light from L.A.","Months after California legalized the marijuana business, pot growers and manufacturers lament that they are still locked out of the legal industry in Los Angeles. 
More than 100 shops have already gotten city approval in Los Angeles, but not the companies that have historically furnished them with cannabis, which were supposed to be second in line under a complex set of city regulations passed in December. 
L.A. had originally planned to finish processing their applications by April but has not even started accepting that paperwork. As 4/20 rolled around Friday — the informal holiday for pot enthusiasts — there was no official word on when that would happen. 
That has aggravated marijuana growers, manufacturers and other cannabis companies seeking to do business legally in Los Angeles. Under California law, they cannot get state licenses if they do not have local authorization. And if they don't have a state license, it is illegal for newly licensed shops to buy their products. 
""If people don't get their licenses in the very near future, their businesses are tenuous,"" said Aaron Herzberg, founding partner of Puzzle Group, a law firm specializing in cannabis licensing and real estate. ""Maybe those businesses are driven into the black market entirely."" 
Marijuana companies that had lined up business locations are being ""bled dry"" as they hang on to costly leases, said Adam Spiker, executive director of the Southern California Coalition, a cannabis industry group. Ryan Jennemann, manager of the cannabis cultivation company THC Design, said his firm has cut dozens of employees in recent months. 
""It's an unsettling feeling,"" Jennemann said. ""We're in a state where cannabis is legal. The 4/20 holiday used to be an underground thing — now they're talking about it on MSNBC. And we don't have permits."" 
The delay has also prevented any new operators, including shops, growers and other marijuana enterprises, from getting into the legal industry in L.A. 
Under the regulations, they would get a shot at city approval in a third phase of applications, after L.A. grants approval to marijuana growers and manufacturers that had been supplying existing shops. 
City officials have chalked up some of the delay to short staffing as the newly formed Department of Cannabis Regulation started poring over business applications. The department currently has only four staffers and has relied on workers loaned to it from other city agencies. Council members voted to hire more employees in February, but those positions have yet to be filled. 
As of Friday, the department had granted approval to 139 pot shops that had been operating in line with an earlier set of city rules — the group of businesses that were first in line for approval. But before other marijuana businesses can apply, the city has been trying to work out remaining details for its ""social equity"" program, which is intended to help people and communities hit hardest by the war on drugs. 
To be eligible for the second phase of licensing, longtime growers and manufacturers that supplied the existing shops must also qualify for that program. If not, they would have to seek licenses in the third phase along with all other kinds of applicants. 
Eligible social equity entrepreneurs include poor applicants who either have been convicted of some marijuana crimes or have lived in areas disproportionately affected by pot arrests, as well as firms providing space or other assistance to disadvantaged applicants. 
But city officials say they are still figuring out how to proceed. 
This year, council members asked to reexamine whether additional communities in the San Fernando Valley, Boyle Heights and parts of downtown might have been disproportionately affected by the war on drugs, potentially allowing people who had lived in those areas to qualify for the program. 
L.A. also needs to fund and set up the outreach and assistance programs that are supposed to be provided under the program — or decide whether to press ahead with licensing social equity applicants before the city can offer such benefits, city officials said. That decision would be made by council members. 
A spokeswoman for City Council President Herb Wesson did not provide comment Friday. 
""The shift from cannabis prohibition to regulation — in the largest cannabis market in the world — is complex, and involves a broad range of stakeholders,"" Cat Packer, who heads L.A.'s Department of Cannabis Regulation, said in a written statement Friday. ""Getting it right will take time."" 
California Minority Alliance Chairman Donnie Anderson, whose group advocated for the social equity program, said that ""we definitely wanted the city to be farther along, but I understand that the city has to make sure things are right."" He added that the city needs to ensure businesses don't find ways to ""scam the system"" meant to benefit poor and marginalized applicants. 
The proposed budget released last week by Mayor Eric Garcetti includes $3.7 million for the cannabis department next budget year, more than four times as much as this year, and provides for 28 staffers. 
In his budget, Garcetti also estimated that the city would get $30 million from taxing the marijuana industry, a crucial infusion that will help bankroll city services. The delay in marijuana licensing has already cost the city this year: It had been anticipating $16 million from taxing cannabis businesses this budget year, but is now expecting to pull in only $4.4 million, according to the mayor's office.

The Trump administration is abandoning a Justice Department threat to crack down on recreational marijuana in states where it is legal, a move that could enable cannabis businesses in California and other states that have legalized pot to operate without fear of federal raids and prosecution. 
This semester, the Los Angeles Times graphics department teamed up with the advanced programming class at the USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Students produced these stories, which required reporting, storytelling, design and development, and were guided and advised by Times reporters. 
A simple guide to pot, THC and how much is too much 
Where are California’s pot shops? And what were some of them before? 
For the cannabis enthusiast who prefers their lungs to be a natural color, and isn't that keen on the calories that come with sweet-treat edibles, Emeryville, Calif., company Kikoko, which started distribution in Southern California at the end of last year, might have the answer: cannabis-infused herbal tea. 
When chef Raul Medina gets the munchies, he’s ready to cook. The Santa Ana chef is behind a vegan taco pop-up in Oakland, Los Angeles and Orange County called Taqueria la Venganza. He’s also a stoner chef. 
Medina recently competed on the Go90 web show “High Cuisine,” in which chefs are tasked with cooking a dish while high. Spoiler alert: His longtime use of marijuana served him well. 
The Senate's top Democrat announced Friday that he is introducing legislation to decriminalize marijuana, the first time that a leader of either party in Congress has endorsed a rollback of one of the country's oldest drug laws.

The recreational use of marijuana became legal in California on Jan. 1. The state is now home to the country’s largest legal pot market. 
But it’s still possible for cannabis customers to run afoul of state and local laws, which dictate where and how weed can be purchased and consumed. 
Here are some tips on avoiding that.

3,3,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-damico-marijuana-ad-restrictions-20180618-story.html,Keep marijuana ads a football field (or two) away from your kids,"The legalization of recreational marijuana use in California has set off an advertising boom on billboards across the state. The gigantic ads try to persuade us — and our offspring — that we can easily get “chill vibes,” say “goodbye stress” or “get rid of pesky hangovers.” The proposed cure-all, of course, is marijuana. 
Since recreational marijuana became legal as of the first of the year, advertising for the drug has gotten out ahead of regulations that could restrict where and how teens are exposed to such promotional displays. But a new Los Angeles City ordinance scheduled to go into effect next month is aimed at protecting minors from exposure to marijuana ads. 
The ordinance focuses on outdoor advertising, and it mirrors established tobacco-advertising guidelines. It will prohibit a billboard promoting marijuana within 700 feet — more than twice the length of a football field — of obvious places children might be. This includes daycare and youth centers, schools, public parks, libraries and playgrounds. It will also restrict smaller outdoor signage, limiting a cannabis retail business to one on-site sign — no portable signs or sandwich boards. 
Solid data about the effects of marijuana advertising back up these restrictions. A seven-year research project my colleagues and I recently completed for the nonprofit Rand Corp., confirmed what common sense suggests: The more exposure young people have to marijuana advertising, the more likely they are to use the drug and to have positive views about it. 
We began our research in 2010, looking for predictors of alcohol and drug use among California teenagers, inspired in part by the movement to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. We recruited more than 6,500 adolescents from 16 middle schools in three school districts in Southern California who went on to attend more than 200 high schools in the region. Among other things, we asked these teens about their exposure to medical marijuana advertising. 
The proportion of teens who reported viewing medical marijuana ads increased sharply over the course of the study, possibly because more ads appeared during the push to legalize marijuana in the state. In 2010, 25% of teens said they had seen at least one medical marijuana ad during the previous three months. By 2017, the exposure rate had nearly tripled to 70%. And that was before recreational-use legalization created this year’s explosion of marijuana billboards on city streets. 
In our study, teens who reported seeing more medical marijuana advertising were more likely to report having used marijuana in the previous 30 days, and they were more likely to say they expected to use it within the next six months. They were also likely to express more positive beliefs about the drug, such as agreeing that marijuana could help someone have more fun or temporarily escape their problems, and to report more negative consequences from marijuana. 
These responses suggest that exposure to medical marijuana advertising may play a significant role not only in shaping teen attitudes about the drug, but it may also contribute to increased use and related negative consequences throughout adolescence. Among the negative consequences the teens reported: skipping school, having trouble concentrating on tasks, and doing something they later regretted, such as having a heated argument with friends or family. 
Parents need to remind teens that the ads they do see almost never tell the whole story. 
Stricter marijuana advertising regulations are good public policy. The state’s recreational-use law limits sales of pot to those 21 or older. This is important because many studies link marijuana use during adolescence to cognitive deficits, depression and other mental health problems. In addition, many teens think marijuana use is less dangerous than alcohol use. According to a 2016 study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, younger drivers were more likely to say they thought it was safe to drive after using marijuana — even though research has shown that marijuana use impairs driving ability. 
Parents won’t be off the hook just because the under-18 set may now be exposed to fewer ads. They should be prepared to share up-to-date information on the effects of both medical and recreational marijuana with their kids. They need to remind teens that the ads they do see almost never tell the whole story. By design, advertising is aimed at persuading us to want something. 
In the case of marijuana, that something is definitely not good for teenagers.

4,4,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-pot-friendly-hotels-20180622-story.html,Full vending machines. Pot on the pillow. What some California hotels are doing to attract marijuana smokers,"A few months after California legalized recreational use of marijuana, the Desert Hot Springs Inn in the Coachella Valley began advertising itself as cannabis friendly — a place where guests can smoke by the pool or heat up a vaporizer in the rooms. 
What surprised innkeeper John Thatcher was not only that business improved by as much as 50% but that most of his pot-smoking guests were upper-income baby boomers. 
“It was not your basement stoner crowd,” he said. 
Like the rest of California, the hospitality industry in the state has moved slowly and tentatively to embrace the use of cannabis on a widespread basis. Desert Hot Springs Inn is one of only a handful of hotels in the Golden State to openly welcome smoking, vaping and otherwise enjoying pot on their properties. 
Cannabis advocates and some hotel industry experts say that it is only a matter of time before vaping rooms and pot-smoking patios become as much a part of hotels as fully stocked mini fridges and cocktail bars. 
“We are seeing more of it with independent hotels embracing it,” said Lynn Mohrfeld, chief executive of the California Hotel and Lodging Assn. “It’s not going away.” 
He said the trade group has been getting an increasing number of calls from hotel operators in California asking the same question: What do we tell hotel guests when they ask for a recommendation for a nearby cannabis dispensary? 
The group has yet to decide how its members should handle such a request, Mohrfeld said. 
“I think there is an interest in this,” he said. “We should get on it sooner rather than later.” 
There is definite interest from Max Groso, a Miami landlord who said he has visited the Desert Hot Springs Inn twice in the past few months on business trips. 
“I love that I don’t have to worry when I smoke, and I go into that little area in the back,” he said of a patio area at the inn. “It’s very relaxing especially in the evening as the sun is going down.” 
Groso said he looks forward to the day when cannabis will be as accepted at hotels as coffee, tea and wine. 
“It may take a while,” he said. 
In California, 57% of voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016, requiring the state to begin issuing licenses to sell recreational pot starting Jan. 1. 
Smoking marijuana is prohibited anywhere conventional cigarettes are banned. The state prohibits smoking of any kind in bars, restaurants and other public places; some local laws are even tougher. 
Although small independent hotels like the Desert Hot Springs Inn are more likely to accept marijuana smokers, the big chain hotels remain resistant to the idea, industry experts said. 
The primary reason for the hesitancy is the fear that pot-friendly hotels will scare away guests with children in tow or business travelers who are paying with a corporate expense account. 
Some experts say cannabis smoke will create a cost burden because it will force the owners of cannabis-friendly hotels to pay to clean the smoke residue from curtains and bedsheets. 
“I think you are talking about a real niche kind of thing,” said Carl Winston, director of the school of hospitality and tourism management at San Diego State University. “I can’t imagine it on a large-scale basis.” 
He added that a global hotel chain that allows cannabis use in California would probably develop a pot-friendly reputation that might hurt business at the hotels it operates in countries where marijuana is illegal. 
“The downside is singularly larger than the upside,” Winston said. 
Don’t tell that to those hotels that have dubbed themselves cannabis friendly. They say occupancy rates have shot up since they put out the word that guests can light up without fear of condemnation. 
At the Hicksville Pines Bud and Breakfast in Idyllwild, business has picked up about 30% since its owner Morgan Night converted the quirky 10-room lodge earlier this year into a cannabis-centric property that features a room adorned with blacklight posters and a snack-filled vending machine. 
“The vending machine loves it because it gets raided frequently,” he said. “Overall it’s been great.” 
Night also operates the Hicksville Trailer Palace and Artist Retreat in Joshua Tree — a motel that houses guests in trailers with names like “The Fi Fi” and “The Pony.” Instead of finding a mint on the pillows, guests of the palace are likely to find a small pot sample. 
“People like free stuff,” he said, noting that it is now legal in the state to give an adult over 21 up to an ounce of pot as a gift. 
Night said he isn’t done yet with his burgeoning pot empire. He hopes to one day get a permit to build a cannabis dispensary and a cafe near his Idyllwild property. 
So far, only a handful of motels in California openly advertise themselves as accepting cannabis smokers. 
But marijuana advocates say many hotels and inns are quietly letting it be known in pot-smoking circles that they tolerate smoking on their properties. 
“They don’t want to be recognized openly,” said Mike Eymer, chief executive and founder of Colorado Cannabis Tours, which lists cannabis-friendly hotels in Denver, California and Las Vegas. “They want discreet bookings.” 
Among Eymer’s list of cannabis-friendly hotels in Los Angeles is a property that is described only as a “420 Friendly Boutique Hotel in West Hollywood.” (The “420” reference is a widely accepted code for marijuana.) The photos on the page seem to identify the property as the Moment Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. 
Dan Brannan, the general manager of the 39-room Moment Hotel, said his property allows smoking — of cigarettes, cigars, pipes and cannabis — on the 2,000-square-foot rooftop lounge but not in any of the rooms or indoor common areas where non-smokers and children might be exposed. 
“What sometimes happens is people are saying I’m pot friendly, but I’m not really pot friendly,” he said, adding that a better description is “pot tolerant.” 
Brannan said marijuana smokers tend to be pretty mellow customers. 
“Pot smokers are not out there being screamers,” he said. “I’d rather have pot smokers than alcoholics and drunks.” 
At the Desert Hot Springs Inn, Thatcher has visions of expanding his tiny nine-room hotel to become a mini pot resort. 
The hotel already offers a pool filled with mineral water — set at 85 degrees — and hot tub — set at 105 degrees. Plus he has a massage room, where guests can get a rubdown with a cannabis extract oil. The guests typically smoke around a fire pit and a shaded patio that looks out onto the San Jacinto Mountains, but they are also allowed to heat up a vaporizer in their rooms. 
The hotel sits on nine acres of land, with a large section that remains undeveloped. Thatcher has notions of one day adding an upscale restaurant or a “bud bar” where guests can buy cannabis. For now, he directs his guests, who hail from as far away as Chicago and Miami, to a pot dispensary down the road. 
“It’s a big thing for them to come here and have the stigma of smoking be gone,” Thatcher said. “I haven’t had a problem renting out rooms.”"
5,5,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cannabis-real-estate-20180331-story.html,Here's why pot sellers are paying prime rents for warehouse and storefront space,"Growing up in Minnesota, Stephanie Smith dreamed of being a golf pro. Instead, the mother of five who lives in Pacific Palisades has ended up in the unlikeliest of trades. 
She claims to be one of the largest marijuana-industry landlords in the state in a business that is growing chaotically as cities begin to allow recreational pot sales after passage of Proposition 64 two years ago. 
And though it has been plenty lucrative for her, the murky legal status of the cannabis industry has led to a police search of her home and to some unflattering news coverage — including a headline that painted her as a drug lord. 
""Cannabis is not illegal,"" said Smith, who is not shy about what she does. ""There is no such thing as a cannabis drug lord."" 
But she does boast controlling nearly 2 million square feet of industrial property, mostly in Southern California. Not all of it is rented to the cannabis trade — one of her tenants is Walmart — but she found that cannabis growers can be desirable tenants willing to pay top-dollar rents. 
That's because there's a race on among formerly underground growers and new entrepreneurs, as well as starry-eyed wannabes, angling to become rich supplying legal pot to Californians who want to get high. 
Some are looking for prime storefronts to open often upscale retail shops, or in rare cases, cannabis bars where patrons can indulge on the property. Others want discreet warehouses — the kind of property Smith owns — where they can grow it, but the buildings are already in short supply. 
Consider the city of Lynwood, which has lower taxes on cannabis businesses than others in the county, said Los Angeles attorney Aaron Herzberg, who helps retailers obtain cannabis sales licenses and arranges purchases of buildings for growers and manufacturers of cannabis products such as oils and edibles. 
Prices for Lynwood industrial buildings were about $107 to $120 per square foot in 2016, he said. Now they are selling for more than $300 a square foot. He expects prices in the region to continue to climb as real estate speculators jump into the market. 
""Prices will skyrocket,"" Herzberg said. ""People are land-banking."" 
Smith learned about the demand in 2009 when she bought a former Los Angeles pawn shop that she decided to turn into a laundromat by upgrading the water, gas and power hookups. 
Smith advertised the renovated building on Craigslist and got a quick response from a would-be tenant offering double her asking rent if he could use it for growing marijuana. Then another grower offered triple the asking rent. 
""I set up a bidding war,"" she said, and ended up settling for the bidders who came in just under three times her asking rent ""because I trusted them to run a professional grow."" 
Cannabis growers and processors are good tenants, she decided, describing them as ""low-maintenance people who just want to do their jobs without a lot of drama."" 
Still, some of her tenants got into a lot of drama in December, when San Bernardino police raided three buildings she owned and confiscated thousands of marijuana plants. They also conducted a surprise search of her Pacific Palisades home the next day and seized her cellphone, she said. 
She was not arrested or charged, but got plenty of media attention: ""Mom accused of running multimillion-dollar pot-growing operation,"" said one headline on a local television station's website. 
She weathered the bad publicity — and then some. 
The two tenants that were raided are still in business and paying her rent, she said. This week, she sued the city of San Bernardino to overturn its new law regulating marijuana commerce, which she claims is unconstitutional. 
One of Smith's most prominent tenants is rapper and marijuana entrepreneur B-Real, the stage name of Louis Freese, the frontman of South Gate hip-hop group Cypress Hill and a longtime cannabis advocate. 
He recently rented an old warehouse in downtown Los Angeles for his growers and is looking for more space, perhaps miles away in the Mojave Valley. 
Aging industrial buildings feel like luxury to marijuana proponents who remember when plants were primarily grown in houses and apartments, he said. 
""The warehouse to a cultivator is like a paradise,"" said Freese, gesturing with his hands apart, a partially smoked blunt between two fingers. 
""It's hard to find a building that is available,"" he said. ""People in the know have already jumped on them."" 
But the industry these days is up against a renewed effort by the federal government to rein it in. 
In January, U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions ended an Obama-era federal policy that provided legal shelter for sales in California and five other states that have allowed recreational pot, placing at risk thousands of marijuana businesses operating legally under state laws. 
""Sessions caused more confusion in the industry,"" said real estate analyst Spencer Levy, head of research in the Americas for property brokerage CBRE. 
The federal stance that marijuana is a dangerous drug on par with heroin and LSD discourages conventional banks from doing business with cannabis-related entrepreneurs. 
That makes it more challenging to buy or rent the property these entrepreneurs need for their work and keeps big well-known landlords and developers such as publicly held real estate investment trusts out of the business. 
Marijuana's outlaw history and uncertain present also get in the way of retailers' efforts to sell it over the counter, Levy said. In addition to government rules such as no sales near schools or churches, there are unofficial barriers imposed by owners of upscale shopping centers and other landlords who fear being tainted by association and won't consider cannabis store tenants. 
But such judgmental attitudes probably won't last long, Levy said, if history is a guide. 
""What is considered appropriate retail is a moving target. Bowling alleys and gyms were once out of favor and now are in"" with image-conscious landlords, he said. ""The pendulum will shift as cannabis becomes as socially acceptable as liquor."" 
A Los Angeles-based chain of cannabis stores called MedMen is cultivating just such an acceptable image with well-appointed emporiums, including one in the Broadway Theater District of downtown Los Angeles that an online commenter said looks ""like a Starbucks had sex with an Apple store."" 
In addition to marijuana samples displayed under glass like desserts, there are cannabis products such as vapor pens, sprays, tongue slips, cookies and soda in elaborate packaging neatly organized on shelves for customers to pick up and examine. 
Music plays in the background as T-shirted staffers assist customers and offer recommendations. Impulse items such as machine-rolled joints sit temptingly next to the cash registers, and tipping is an option when paying with your debit card. 
""We are not reinventing retail. It's a known science,"" MedMen spokesman Daniel Yi said. ""We're bringing it to marijuana."" 
Stores like MedMen have more in common with boutiques than bars. Anyone older than 21 can walk in and make a purchase, but they can't indulge there. Now, though, there is a movement to open pot businesses similar to bars. 
West Hollywood officials expect to shortly be the first in the region to issue licenses — 16 of them — for cannabis consumption lounges, said Jackie Rocco, the city's business development manager. 
West Hollywood has long supported cannabis for medical use, she said, but many apartment landlords don't allow smoking. 
""So where do you go? You can't do it on the street,"" Rocco said. ""We need safe spaces to consume responsibly."" 
Rents are also jumping for storefronts that could lease to shops or eventually cannabis bars, if cities approve them. 
""There's definitely a markup as soon as you say marijuana"" to many landlords, said longtime L.A. dispensary operator Oliver Summers, who has been in the industry since 2005. 
Some cannabis retailers even agree to share profits with their landlords. ""I don't know anybody who's paying less than $6,500 a month rent,"" he said, ""and that is for a small shop in a tough neighborhood."" 
A recent bidding war for a decent 1,600-square-foot storefront on the Westside of Los Angeles ended at $35,000 per month, he said, or about $22 per square foot. That's a high retail rent for the area. 
""It's really getting to be a huge pain for us"" to find retail locations with unrestricted zoning and pot-friendly landlords, he said. ""I remember when this business used to be fun."" 
But for Smith, the legalization and lack of ""fun"" mean there has been a shakeout that is leaving behind a lot of operators who came up when the cannabis business operated in a gray area. 
Her prospective tenants must be professional and ""understand that you need a real person to sign a lease, you can't steal power — you need to act like a real business. Not everyone has the executive skills to step forward into the light."" 
Her tenant B-Real is an established businessman who has a downtown studio where he records entertaining cannabis-related YouTube videos as ""Dr. Greenthumb.""

6,6,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-marijuana-20180608-story.html,Trump says he is likely to support ending blanket federal ban on marijuana,"President Trump said he likely will support a congressional effort to end the federal ban on marijuana, a major step that would reshape the pot industry and end the threat of a Justice Department crackdown. 
Trump’s remarks put him sharply at odds with Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions on the issue. The bill in question, pushed by a bipartisan coalition, would allow states to go forward with legalization unencumbered by threats of federal prosecution. Sessions, by contrast, has ramped up those threats and has also lobbied Congress to reduce current protections for medical marijuana. 
Trump made his comments to a gaggle of reporters Friday morning just before he boarded a helicopter on his way to the G-7 summit in Canada. His remarks came the day after the bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed their measure. 
One of the lead sponsors is Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is aligned with Trump on several issues but recently has tangled with the administration over the Justice Department’s threats to restart prosecutions in states that have legalized marijuana. 
“I support Sen. Gardner,” Trump said when asked about the bill. “I know exactly what he’s doing. We’re looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.” 
The legislative proposal, which is also championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), would reshape the legal landscape for marijuana if it becomes law. 
California and eight other states, as well as Washington, D.C., have legalized all adult use of marijuana. An additional 20 states permit marijuana for medical use. 
But even as states legalize, marijuana has remained a risky and unstable business because of federal law making it illegal. Concerns about federal law enforcement seizures have inhibited most lenders from working with marijuana businesses. And investors have also proceeded cautiously. 
“If you are in the marijuana business ... you can’t get a bank loan or set up a bank account because of concern over the conflict between state and federal law,” Gardner said at a news conference Thursday to unveil the new bill. “We need to fix this. It is time we take this industry out of the shadows, bring these dollars out of the shadows.” 
He called it a “public hypocrisy” that the firms are expected to pay taxes yet are barred from participation in the financial system. 
A lifting of the federal prohibition also would bolster efforts to create uniform testing and regulatory standards for marijuana, and potentially free scientists to pursue research into the medical uses of marijuana. 
Trump’s support could potentially have a major impact, providing political cover for Republicans who worry about being tagged as soft on drugs. Still, the proposal faces a tough road in Congress. 
Even though most lawmakers now represent areas where pot is legal for at least medical use — and public opinion polls show majorities of Democratic and Republican voters nationwide favor legalization — congressional leaders have shown little appetite for loosening restrictions. The House is blocking the District of Columbia from permitting sales of recreational pot, even after its voters chose to legalize. A 2014 budget amendment that protects medical marijuana businesses from Drug Enforcement Administration raids is perpetually under attack. 
“It faces tremendous head winds,” John Hudak, a marijuana policy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said, referring to the Gardner-Warren bill. 
Trump said he is likely to support the federal legalization effort despite a warning against it from a coalition of narcotics officer groups. 
“We urge you to see through the smoke screen and reject attempts to encourage more drug use in America,” they wrote in a letter to Trump Thursday. 
The marijuana industry continues to be whipsawed by mixed messages from the administration. 
In January, the Justice Department sent pot businesses into a panic by rescinding an Obama-era policy that restricted prosecutors from targeting sellers who operate legally under state laws. Sessions warned at the time that any pot business could find itself in the crosshairs of prosecutors — regardless of whether marijuana was legal in their state. 
The move enraged Gardner, who said the administration had earlier given him assurances that there would be no such raids, at least in his state. At Gardner’s behest, Trump in April ordered an abrupt retreat from the announced crackdown. Trump made the order without even consulting Sessions, a sign of their tense relationship. 
But prosecutors did back off. During this administration, there have apparently been no federal raids or seizures of pot companies for sales that are legal under state law. 
“Remarkably little, if anything, has changed,” said John Vardaman, a former Justice Department attorney who helped draft the Obama-era rules, known as the Cole memo, after former Deputy Atty. Gen. James M. Cole, who issued it. “Almost every U.S. attorney in states where marijuana is legal has decided to apply the same principles as the Cole memo,” said Vardaman, now an executive at Hypur, which sells banking compliance software to marijuana companies. 
Banking is the area in which the Gardner bill could most help pot companies. 
The Senate proposal, and a companion bipartisan measure in the House, would amend the Controlled Substances Act so that its marijuana provisions do not apply to any person or business that is in compliance with state laws. To put bankers at ease, it specifies that such marijuana sales would not be considered trafficking and do not amount to illegal financial transactions. 
“The very people you want involved in this market are the ones who have been most reluctant to get involved because of the banking issue,” said Vardaman. “If you address that, you would have enormous beneficial effects for the industry.” 
While Trump’s comments were welcomed by marijuana activists, they remain on edge, especially because of Trump’s spotty record at actually pushing legislation through Congress. 
“We have seen this president voice his support for a lot of things related to cannabis, but he has done absolutely nothing to move legislation,” said Hudak. “This is just more empty rhetoric from a president who is vague on this issue.” 
Gardner is hoping he can persuade more of his conservative colleagues to join the crusade by framing the issue as one of state’s rights. Several Republicans, including Reps. Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa and Don Young of Alaska, are demanding an end to federal marijuana laws that intrude on the states. Their movement is slowly growing in Congress. 
“This is a chance for us to express that federalism works,” said Gardner, who like some other Republicans was not a proponent of marijuana but took up the cause after his state’s voters endorsed legalization, “to take an idea that states have led with and provide a solution that allows them to continue to lead.”

Companies began selling pot in a relatively small number of businesses Monday, with more expected to join in the coming days and weeks. 
The state has issued dozens of permits for retailers to begin recreational sales this week, expanding a market that is expected to grow to $7 billion annually by 2020. Several of those retailers are in West Hollywood, but they won't open until Tuesday at the city's request. That makes Santa Ana's licensed stores the closest option for Angelenos who want to buy recreational marijuana on New Year's Day. Buyers could also trek to San Diego or the Palm Springs area to purchase pot. 
To sell cannabis commercially in January — for recreational or medical use — marijuana businesses must have local approval and a state license. Existing medical marijuana dispensaries have been given first priority for recreational sales. 
The city of Los Angeles has yet to start issuing local licenses to pot shops, which stirred unease among some existing medical marijuana dispensaries that have been following city rules. 
Hundreds of customers — everyone from older people in leisure suits to a young man in pajamas got in line — waited upwards of an hour to buy such things as pre-rolled joints to topical creams and foods infused with marijuana. 
Urbn Leaf, which operates stores in Bay Park and Golden Hill, rented a 40-foot bus to bring customers in from a bar in Pacific Beach. The company also had 31 drivers making deliveries in San Diego, which is currently the only part of the county where recreational cannabis can be sold. 
""We can deliver marijuana in 20 minutes; it's like pizza,"" said Will Senn, co-founder of Urbn Leaf. 
He surveyed the line outside of his Bay Park store and said, ""This is crazy. We hoped for big crowds, and prepared. But we didn't expect this."" 
By noon Monday, the store had served more than 350 customers, more than it serves all day. 
""We're at capacity inside, we have 75 people in line, and the line is getting longer,"" Senn said. ""We would get as many as 1,000 people by the end of the day."" 
Just after midnight, some raised joints instead of champagne glasses. 
Johnny Hernandez, a tattoo artist from Modesto, celebrated by smoking ""Happy New Year blunts"" with his cousins. 
""This is something we've all been waiting for,"" he said. ""It is something that can help so many people and there's no reason why we should not be sharing that."" 
Hernandez said he hoped the legalization of recreational marijuana would help alleviate the remaining stigma some still believe surrounds marijuana use. 
""People might actually realize weed isn't bad. It helps a lot of people,"" he said. 
Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and state Sen. Nancy Skinner were on hand for a ribbon-cutting ceremony as his city began selling marijuana legally. Customers began lining up before dawn Monday outside Berkeley Patients Group, one of the oldest dispensaries in the nation. A big crowd also gathered at Harborside dispensary in nearby Oakland. 
Heather Sposeto came to Sacramento's Northstar Holistic Collective with her boyfriend, Matthew Wilcox, to check out the hype around California's newly legalized marijuana. 
The 50-year-old Sposeto doesn't smoke pot, but said she's considering starting now that it became legal at 12:01 a.m. Monday. 
She said being in the dispensary, with counters of options ranging from chocolate to bud, felt ""surreal."" 
Wilcox purchased some pot after perusing the options. The 53-year-old smokes recreationally almost daily but had never been in a dispensary. He said given the price, he's likely to continue purchasing through his personal connections. 
Jeff Deakin waited all night outside Harborside with his wife and dog. The 66-year-old says it's a big deal that they can buy cannabis while feeling safe and secure, without having to make the purchase in a back alley. 
California's Bureau of Cannabis Control is continuing to review applications and approve licenses after retail sales of marijuana became legal on the New Year's Day holiday. 
Spokesman Alex Traverso says he isn't aware of any problems at the roughly 100 shops around the state that began selling pot Monday. 
There has been growing anticipation over the beginning of pot sales. 
""We are excited. We just got our state license on Saturday ... so immediately there was extra energy in everyone's step,"" said Robert Taft Jr., founder of the medical marijuana dispensary 420 Central in Santa Ana. ""Being part of history is an amazing thing."" 
Taft said he brought in five new cash registers and hired six additional ""bud tenders"" in preparation for the new law. He also doubled his inventory and consulted with his attorneys daily to ensure his store was in full compliance. 
Taft has also increased the store's security, adding 24-hour armed guards. Selling recreational marijuana is an all-cash business. 
Kiloh, president of the United Cannabis Business Assn., now says his dispensary will be able to continue providing medical marijuana to patients in January by operating as a ""collective"" until it has received state and local licenses. After weighing their legal options, most of the marijuana shops in his group are operating the same way, Kiloh said. 
As soon as L.A. grants them approval, those marijuana dispensaries will seek state licenses, he added. 
For many in the industry, the new law signals a long-awaited shift. 
""The days of the dime bag are long, long gone,"" said Daniel Yi, spokesman for MedMen, one of the three West Hollywood shops that will be selling cannabis for recreational use. 
Medical marijuana customers at the shop Sunday browsed through lotions, honey and wellness packages infused with cannabis. Some poked at an iPad with a menu showing closeups of different marijuana buds. 
Yi said the new law will make it hard for the country to ignore the emergence of recreational cannabis. 
""This is the most populous state. We've popularized yoga. We've popularized sushi,"" he said. ""I think this is going to move the needle like nothing else when it comes to the national conversation."" 
Brian Gordon believes the new law will help remove the stigma from a drug that is already widely used. 
Unfortunately, he said, that progress costs money. 
When he went to purchase an ounce of low-grade cannabis from his regular West Hollywood dispensary, he was told that the new law would significantly drive up prices. State, city and sales taxes will push up the price of the drug by more than a third. 
Those who register with the Los Angeles County Department of Health and enroll in the medical marijuana program will be exempted from paying sales taxes, but they will still see a 25% increase. 
Gordon, who is between jobs, said the increase will hurt him and other patients who use the drug for medical purposes. 
""I don't mind paying the extra money if the money is actually being used for good,"" said Gordon, who uses cannabis to ease his sciatica pain. 
At a nearby marijuana shop, a bud tender said that patients have expressed shock and anger at the increased cost. 
""This is not right,"" he said. He requested anonymity because he feared losing his job for speaking about the issue without the shop owner's permission. 
The bud tender said he would not have voted to legalize recreational marijuana use if he knew the cost would jump so high. He was worried that additional tax increases would be enacted, and that shop owners will pass on the cost of running a legal marijuana business to customers.

""This is what I got into this business for,"" he said. ""This is what I signed up for."" 
Churchill said he usually expects increased sales in the first few months of the year. But this year, he expects business to ""double or triple on top of that"" because of recreational marijuana sales. 
Allowing recreational marijuana use will change California for the better, he added, because regulations will ensure that dispensaries are operating safely and selling quality products. 
""I think regulations will be good for everybody,"" he said. ""Having the safety net of not worrying about going to jail is worth the extra tax.""

9,9,CA,www.latimes.com,http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-legal-pot-day-one-20180102-story.html,"For marijuana users, it's high times as California makes recreational use legal","""Groove on! Groove on!"" blared from speakers outside a gray warehouse in Santa Ana. Inside, a line of 60 people snaked through the shop, waiting to be helped by a budtender. 
""We were bombarded!"" said Robert Taft Jr., founder of the marijuana dispensary 420 Central. 
When the shop opened at 7 a.m. Monday — Day 1 of legal recreational pot sales in California — a handful of people had already lined up. Within two hours, more than 100 customers, some still nursing holiday hangovers, had made purchases. As they walked out, Taft shouted, ""Enjoy your new freedom!"" 
Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016, and the historic law permitting such businesses took effect New Year's Day — creating the largest legal pot market in the country. Hundreds of businesses have applied for temporary licenses, but industry officials expect a slow roll out as many cities have not yet given their approval. While the city of L.A. hasn't begun issuing licenses to pot shops, some dispensaries are expected to open in West Hollywood on Tuesday. 
On Monday, San Francisco businesses weren't open for commercial sales of pot, but Berkeley was ready. One of the United States' oldest dispensaries, the Berkeley Patients Group, opened its doors at 6 a.m. to a line of customers that snaked around the block and showed no signs of abating by late afternoon. 
Among the many celebrants were Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and state Sen. Nancy Skinner, who cut a ceremonial green ribbon to mark the first sale. 
Sean Luse, chief operating officer of Berkeley Patients Group, said some people had traveled from the Central Valley and towns in the Sierra foothills to visit the dispensary. 
""I'd say the crowd size is about three or four times what we would typically see,"" Luse said. ""Now that it's mainstream and open to anyone 21-plus, you have a different dynamic. People are coming in groups or as families — it feels festive today."" 
In San Diego, the wait stretched to 40 minutes at the Mankind Cooperative. 
""We're insane down here. And it's still going on, girlfriend,"" marketing director Cathy Bliss said. 
Store workers were handing out commemorative T-shirts showing astronauts on the moon and the phrase ""A giant leap for mankind."" 
California's new marijuana law allows sales to people from out of state. Bliss welcomed buyers from Iowa, Kansas and Canada. 
Overall, she was thrilled. ""This is so cool,"" she said. 
Back inside 420 Central, customers hunched over the glass counter, inspecting different flavors of pot — Grape Kryptonite, Girl Scout Cookies, Mega Queso. Prefer edibles? Budtenders pointed to a pack of dark chocolate covered espresso beans for $18. The nearby tip jar reads, ""Hate to be BLUNT WEED love a tip."" 
As Lucas Starr, 33, perused the shop, he thought about how much perceptions of marijuana had shifted during his lifetime. Growing up, the message from his parents and from society, he said, was that marijuana was a dangerous drug — a gateway toward a wrecked life. He thought back to the PSA commercials showing a fried egg and an announcer intoning, ""This is your brain on drugs."" Starr, a musician and producer visiting from Dallas, said he initially bought into the fear, but eventually smoked marijuana and found that it calmed his anxiety. 
Customer Judy Malgeri, 65, also finds marijuana therapeutic. She uses it to manage pain and bring back her appetite during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Although she already had a medicinal-marijuana card, she said she was very happy to see recreational pot legalized — anything that brings marijuana further into the mainstream, she said, is a good thing. 
""It's about time,"" she said, shaking her head at the memory of an era when police hassled people over a single seed of marijuana in a car. ""Arrested for a joint? That's so sad. It's a fruit of the Earth."" 
Despite the new law, marijuana still straddles the line of public acceptability, and there was palpable apprehension among some customers Monday. 
When a man with graying hair and a Bluetooth headset walked inside the shop, he left his sunglasses on and did a double-take when he noticed a TV cameraman nearby. Asked what he was interested in, the man laughed nervously, saying, ""It's been a while,"" adding that he recalled enjoying edibles. 
He settled on a container of cannabis-infused sea salt caramel candies and pulled $20 out of his wallet. ""I think this might be a one-time thing,"" the man said, laughing. The budtender smiled, telling him he was always welcome. 
Approached by a reporter as he left the store, the man gasped. ""Oh my God!"" He continued, ""No, I'm not here."" 
Earlier in the morning, Gary Goforth walked out of the shop smiling. His trip to the dispensary hadn't been planned, but while walking to breakfast, a man pulled up next to him and asked, ""Hey, where's 420?"" 
Goforth hadn't heard of the shop, but offered to look up the location on his phone and ride along with the man to help him navigate. As a thank you, the stranger bought him a gram of indica. 
The 27-year-old bartender — who said he sold marijuana during college to pay his rent — said legalization was a necessary step. 
""It's a new future,"" he said, adding that he hopes to get a job at the shop. ""Why not move up in the ranks in something you enjoy?"" 
Back inside, Taft, the founder, smiled as he watched the line growing in the lobby. 
""Weed the people should be proud,"" he said, delivering the first word with emphasis, so you know he didn't misspeak. ""Red and blue turns into green when we come together. We can change any law we want."" 
Taft then began to reminisce about how the dispensary, which opened in 2015 as a medical-marijuana shop, got its start. Back when he was hunting for a building, his friend who works in real estate showed him the warehouse. Taft thought it was too big — it reminded him of Costco, not a dispensary. 
But moments later, he looked up at the address numbers on the side of the warehouse — 420. He turned to ask his friend what street they were on. ""Central,"" the friend responded. 
""So you're telling me this is 420 Central?"" Taft asked. 
His friend fell to his knees in shock.

11,11,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Federal-cannabis-bill-would-help-California-12979852.php,Federal cannabis bill would help California marijuana businesses get banking,"A bipartisan effort in Congress to ease federal restrictions on cannabis, which President Trump said Friday he is inclined to support, would solve a few of the biggest problems facing the nascent industry in California, experts say. 
Most importantly, they say, the bill introduced Thursday — which gives states the authority to create their own marijuana laws — would open the door to banking for businesses by declaring that cannabis activities that comply with state rules do not constitute “trafficking” and their proceeds, therefore, are not the fruits of illegal transactions. 
“It’s a really elegant solution,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for hundreds of marijuana farmers, business owners and patients in the state. “It doesn’t go all the way, but it does alleviate some of the day-to-day challenges we face.” 
The Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act, or STATES Act, from Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Reps. David Joyce, R-Ohio, and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., would keep in place restrictions such as the bans on the sale of recreational marijuana to people under 21 and on employing anyone under 18 in a cannabis-related job. 
The bill would also prohibit marijuana distribution at places such as rest areas and truck stops. By allowing states to control what happens with cannabis within their borders, the bill could also usher in new medicinal research into the drug. And industrial hemp, which can be turned into oils or fabrics, wouldn’t be classified as marijuana under the proposal. 
“This is allowing the states to determine for themselves what they are going to do under recreational marijuana or medical marijuana ... and oils, anything else that they may decide, in this area of the law,” Gardner said in a joint interview with Warren on Fox News. “This is not a legalization bill. This doesn’t change the schedule. This just says that if a state like Massachusetts or Colorado decides to legalize, then that would be allowed under federal law. If a state like Oklahoma doesn’t want to do that, nothing changes.” 
Trump suggested Friday he could get behind it, telling reporters, “We’re looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.” The position put him at odds with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who earlier this year encouraged federal prosecutors to file criminal charges for marijuana crimes, even in states that have legalized sale and use of the drug. 
Michael Liszewski, a policy adviser with the antidrug-criminalization Drug Policy Alliance, said there are still hurdles in committees and elsewhere that need to be crossed, but was optimistic that broader marijuana reforms at the federal level are within reach. 
“The fact that we had the president give some very encouraging remarks about its prospects less than a day after it was introduced — we think that changes the landscape for the better,” he said. “This would spell the end of federal interference as long as the state laws and the businesses operating under them stayed within the guard rails of the STATES Act.” 
California and eight other states, as well as Washington, D.C., have legalized all adult use of marijuana. Twenty other states permit medical marijuana use. 
But because of the federal prohibition, many businesses are locked out of traditional banking and lending activities. Retailers in California are known to stuff piles of cash into shopping bags and suitcases when trucking payments to state tax collectors. Lawmakers are working on a bill that would create a state charter bank for the industry. 
Cities such as Oakland require cannabis business applicants to submit detailed security plans to lessen the chances of getting robbed. 
“There are huge public safety implications to an all-cash industry,” Allen said. 
The STATES Act could not only permit businesses to get bank accounts — since their operations would no longer be considered federal crimes — it could also allow them to deduct ordinary business expenses from their taxes, Liszewski said. 
And a broader fear — that the feds could simply shut everything down someday — would potentially be abated, at least for the businesses that are licensed and in compliance with state regulations. Alex Traverso, spokesman for the California Bureau of Cannabis Control, said that worry, along with banking problems, are the chief concerns the state office hears. 
The proposed law doesn’t explicitly address whether cannabis could be sold across state lines. Liszewski, though, said it might leave room for that possibility, if the states sending and receiving the product both authorized those operations. 
Right now, Allen said, “The industry is crippled by the fact that we can only sell here in the state. ... What if you told the almond industry they could only sell in the state? That would be a disaster.”

12,12,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Cheap-cannabis-products-available-before-new-13032125.php,Cheap cannabis products available before new California rules kick in,"A bonanza of cheap marijuana is flooding the market this week as growers, manufacturers and retailers unload excess cannabis in preparation for the enforcement of strict testing and packaging regulations that are sure to further shake up California’s budding industry. 
The regulations took effect Jan. 1, but the state suspended enforcement during the first six months to give the industry time to prepare. The end of the transition period Sunday means all recreational and medical cannabis sold in California must be tested in state approved laboratories, sealed in child-resistant packages and labeled by the producer. 
All the remaining untested products must be destroyed by Sunday. Retailers, loath to waste their stashes, are unloading stock for bargain basement prices. Discounts of as much as 50 percent have been seen this week in the Bay Area. 
“I think the next couple of days here are likely to be historic lows for retail cannabis,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for some 1,250 medical marijuana farmers and business owners around the state. “I don’t think you’ll see prices this low ever again.” 
The rules allow sales of cannabis that have been lab-tested for quality and have proven to be free of pesticides, chemicals and toxins. All smokable or edible products must be packaged in child-resistent containers and, before they go out to retailers, affixed with labels that outline potency and dosage amounts. 
Edible cannabis goods must not have more than 10 milligrams of THC per serving or 100 milligrams per package, according to the regulations, which were regarded largely as a guideline since January, when legal sales of marijuana to adults began. The smokable stuff can have as much as 1,000 milligrams of THC per package for recreational and 2,000 milligrams for medical users, the guidelines say. All medical marijuana products must be labeled. 
Cannabis policy and enforcement experts estimate that as much as $500 million worth of cannabis will have to be destroyed in California on Sunday, and it is expected to be rough going for a while as the market adapts to the rules and growers search out new distributors to replace suppliers who didn’t take the time to get a license during the grace period. 
“It’s certainly going to be a disruptive and painful transition, for retailers especially,” said Allen, who expects the bargain buying to end abruptly once the regulations take hold. “There is going to be a slowdown because I don’t think the statewide supply chain exists yet.” 
Prices are expected to rise, at least initially. Retailers say high prices — combined with the 15 percent excise tax on purchases of cannabis and cannabis products, including medicinal marijuana — are going to give the industry some headaches. 
“I suspect we’ll have a shortage for a while until distributors get their testing figured out,” said Erich Pearson, the founder of the San Francisco Patient and Resource Center, now known as Sparc. “We’ll see limited supplies of brands and products, and probably lesser quantities, too. This at a time when we’re reaching the time of year when the highest demand for cannabis products is in the summer months.” 
Growers must pay a $9.25 tax for every ounce of bud grown, along with a $2.75-an-ounce tax on dried cannabis leaves. The statewide sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent, but many cities and counties have added voter-approved district taxes, the amounts of which vary. 
None of this bodes well for an industry that is already suffering from a revenue shortage. California collected $60.9 million in excise, cultivation and sales taxes in the first quarter of the year, roughly $30 million less than projections made by the state in January. 
Cannabis industry officials blame the lackluster figures on the reluctance of retailers and growers to go through the legal and financial red tape of entering the legal market, a situation that has kept black market growers in business. 
Allen said about half of the 1,250 marijuana businesses that he represents have obtained the temporary licenses issued by the state. State officials are expecting to complete the permanent regulations and release them for public review in mid-to-late July. That process must be completed before annual licenses are issued. 
Experts say illegal growers provide about 80 percent of the pot sold in other states. Bootleg marijuana is circulating widely around Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties, known as the Emerald Triangle. An estimated 8,000 outdoor growers produce marijuana in Humboldt County, but not even half of them have filed applications under the county’s medical marijuana permit process. 
“The black market is so large, and the taxes and regulations are so hard, that until the state decides to take action against the black market, it will remain a very robust and profitable business for those who participate in it,” Pearson said. “The over-regulation and taxation creates a very attractive alternative for consumers.” 
Alex Traverso, communications chief for the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, urged patience while the various state agencies, including investigators, code enforcement officers and law enforcement, build strength and set priorities. He said the state has sent out more than 2,300 cease-and-desist orders to unlicensed retail and delivery services and will soon begin enforcing those orders. 
“Every state that has legalized adult use of marijuana has had bumps in the road,” Traverso said. “We are very motivated to have things work, and make sure our licensees have products on their shelves and that the products are safe. If there are issues, we will find our best way forward.” 
Allen said he believes many more retailers and growers will be obtaining permits once the state regulations are completed and permanent annual licenses are available. That, in turn, will improve the supply chain, he said. 
Although the process of throwing out the old and bringing in the new is difficult, he said, it is necessary if California’s experiment in cannabis commerce is going to work. 
“A lot of growers are excited for these requirements to be going online because, at the very least, we should be able to see the regulated market reward folks who are following the rules,” Allen said. “They’ve been competing with folks who have chosen to cut corners when it comes to pesticides. It’s exciting that for the first time in history, the entire market will be focusing on clean cannabis.”

13,13,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Legalized-marijuana-will-be-a-bit-different-from-12452940.php,Legalized marijuana will be a bit different from version that voters bought,"California is days away from launching a legal marketplace for adults to buy and sell recreational marijuana. On Jan. 1, the state will carry through on a vision voters endorsed by passing Proposition 64 last year. 
Yet as legal cannabis moves from campaign pitch to reality — amid lots of lobbying by industry groups along the way — some details of the plan have changed. State regulators approved the official rules last month and will update them in about a year. 
“Some of the things that were touted (during the Prop. 64 campaign) definitely have been changed or reneged,” said Andrew Acosta, a political consultant who worked on the campaign against the initiative. 
Here are a few ways the new rules differ from what voters may have expected: 
Protecting small farms? Campaign literature supporting Prop. 64 last year said the initiative “protects small farmers, so California’s marijuana industry isn’t overrun by mega-corporations.” The measure was crafted to give small-scale growers a five-year advantage by forbidding licenses for pot farms bigger than one acre until 2023. 
Now many of the mom-and-pop growers who were supposed to benefit are crying foul. They say the new rules won’t protect them because there’s no limit on the number of small-farm licenses a business can get. 
“A grower can get 10 licenses and effectively be a large grower. That seems like a loophole,” said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, which represents more than 1,000 marijuana businesses, including many small farms in the northern reaches of the state. 
Legislators from the north coast went even further, with state Sen. Mike McGuire calling the current rules “a broken promise.” A Democrat from Healdsburg, McGuire issued a statement saying that without a cap on the number of licenses, large corporations will “crush the livelihood of small family farmers.” 
A spokesman for the Department of Food and Agriculture, which regulates cannabis farms under Prop. 64, said the rules don’t include a cap on small licenses “because Proposition 64 did not provide authority to impose such a limit.” 
“However,” spokesman Jay Van Rein said, “local jurisdictions may impose that type of limit on their own if it meets the needs of their constituents.” 
Tap-an-app delivery to your doorstep. Backers of Prop. 64 said emphatically last year that the initiative was not intended to allow on-demand delivery of recreational marijuana, a popular service among medicinal users that allows them to order cannabis products from an online menu and have drivers deliver the drugs to their door. 
The Prop. 64 campaign even made the argument before a judge, saying the initiative would not allow customers to place orders online — only “in a brick and mortar establishment.” 
They were trying to beat back opposition from law enforcement groups that argued that Internet-based home delivery would make it too easy for teenagers to get marijuana. 
Now it turns out California will allow on-demand delivery of recreational cannabis, including for orders placed online. 
“That was something we have heard a lot about from the very beginning, about how people wanted to be able to deliver to people’s homes,” said Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which held public meetings around the state during the process of drafting the recreational marijuana rules. 
“After hearing the reaction from people in the industry, from patients, from people who came to summits and town halls, it became clear that it was something we needed to look at.” 
Prop. 64 spokesman Jason Kinney said many local governments wanted rules that would allow for on-demand delivery. Some cities wanted to prohibit cannabis storefronts, but allow businesses to deliver it to customers who order online. 
“We give them the authority to decide what takes place in their jurisdiction,” Kinney said, noting that online delivery services must have a distribution premises licensed by local officials. “We don’t view it as being in conflict” with arguments made in the Prop. 64 campaign. 
Restrictions on advertising. Promises that Prop. 64 would ban cannabis ads aimed at youths permeated the campaign last year. The measure does restrict how licensed marijuana businesses can advertise, forbidding them from mounting billboards alongside interstate highways, as well as near schools and playgrounds. 
But it turns out that the language of the law doesn’t cover all businesses that have a commercial interest in marijuana. It leaves out companies — like the popular website Weedmaps — that promote cannabis businesses but don’t directly sell marijuana themselves. 
That’s because the law restricts advertising only by licensed marijuana businesses, and a Web platform that doesn’t directly sell marijuana doesn’t need a state license. 
Weedmaps billboards — some sporting phrases like “High California,” “High Hollywood” and “High Sactown” — have popped up around the state. The company has 120 billboards up in California, including three along interstate highways, said spokesman Carl Fillichio. He said Weedmaps does not advertise near schools or playgrounds. 
A bipartisan team of state legislators thinks the website should be subject to the same rules as other marijuana businesses. 
“They are clearly promoting use of cannabis and advertising cannabis, and in my view, they should be subject to the same rules and regulations as licensees,” said Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda. He’s one of five lawmakers who signed a letter asking state regulators to find a way to limit ads by marijuana-focused Web platforms. 
“Maybe we thought at the time when we adopted Prop. 64 that licensees was the appropriate universe to cover, but certainly Weedmaps is driving a truck through a loophole that should be closed,” Bonta said. 
Kinney, the Prop. 64 spokesman, is also a lobbyist whose firm represents Weedmaps. The company spent at least $850,000 to help pass Prop. 64 last year and an additional $172,000 lobbying this year on its implementation. 
He said he couldn’t comment on how Weedmaps will respond to lawmakers’ demand to limit advertising. But he noted that regulating advertising by a media platform is a “slippery slope.” 
“I assume we’ll be actively part of a discussion next year,” he said.

14,14,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Oakland-s-marijuana-equity-program-is-hurting-13077077.php,Oakland’s marijuana equity program is hurting those it was supposed to help,"Alexis Bronson thinks the advantage Oakland’s cannabis equity program promised him is shrinking. 
That’s because he doesn’t yet have space to grow his clone plants. 
Oakland reserved half of its cannabis permits for applicants like Bronson, a black man who’s been cultivating cannabis for more than 30 years. As a teen, Bronson sold weed to his Berkeley High School classmates, but he was hoping that Oakland’s equity program would help launch a successful, sustainable business. 
To qualify for the equity program, applicants had to be city residents earning less than 80 percent of the average city income. And they had to either live in a specified high-crime zone for at least 10 of the past 20 years or have been convicted of a cannabis crime in Oakland after Nov. 5, 1996. 
The goal was to allow people living in parts of the city disproportionately affected by the failed war on drugs to get to the front of the pack of businesses seeking fortune in California’s cannabis gold rush. 
To get the equity program off the ground, the city moved what it calls general applicants to the front of the permit line if they “incubated” equity applicants by providing them with 1,000 square feet of free business space. 
The space must be provided for three years. 
Bronson signed lease agreements with two incubators — NUG and Joyous Recreation & Wellness Group. He thought he’d be cultivating clones in the spaces by February, but both companies encountered significant construction delays. 
According to Bronson, John Oram, CEO of Bloom Innovations, a horticulture consulting and management firm of which NUG is a subsidiary, told him his space, a greenhouse in East Oakland, would be ready in November. 
Bronson told me Joyous Wellness hasn’t updated its timeline for him to move into the West Oakland warehouse. 
Bronson got tired of waiting, so he asked the city to revoke the local authorization for the temporary state licenses of NUG and Joyous Wellness for failure to deliver the space. Without local authorization, businesses would run afoul of local and state cannabis laws. 
“The purpose of the equity program is that we’re all starting off on a level playing field. That’s why they got the priority license,” said Bronson, who’s spent thousands on state application fees. “That’s why they incubated us. And meanwhile, I’m sitting here with no income.” 
I’ve long supported the idea of Oakland’s equity program, but here is another example of how structurally flawed the implementation of the program has been. Bronson’s state licenses might expire before he gets into his spaces, and he doesn’t have the money to renew the licenses because his business isn’t generating much revenue. 
And Bronson has a point: Waiting a year to start operating doesn’t seem like a head start for an equity business. 
After attending a hearing for Joyous Wellness at City Hall on Friday, it seems that untangling disagreements between equity and general applicants could get messy. 
Before the mediator, Denise Eaton-May, could get comfortable in her seat, the squabbling began. Joyous Wellness didn’t realize that its letter of authorization had been revoked, and that the hearing was actually an appeal of the city’s decision and not a hearing on proposed revocation. 
A company representative asked for an extension, which the city granted against the wishes of Bronson’s attorney, Natalia Thurston. The hearing was rescheduled for later this month. 
“There’s no enforcement of these agreements,” Thurston told me. “There’s no motivation for these people to follow through — unless the city does take action” to revoke permits. 
A representative for Joyous Wellness declined to comment after the hearing. Greg Minor, an assistant city administrator who signed the revocation notices, also declined to comment. 
NUG’s hearing was also scheduled for Friday, but the company had already agreed with Bronson to postpone it to July 31. The permit process for any new industry is expected to be complicated and slow, and last month I wrote about NUG’s repeated delays with building permits and inspections. 
“What’s not to be expected is the city administrator’s office would not acknowledge that this delay, if anything, is the building department’s fault, not the general applicant’s fault,” said Robert Selna, an attorney representing NUG. “The building department plays a significant role in the fact that Alexis Bronson doesn’t have his greenhouse space.” 
Revoking permits absolves the city from any role in the equity program’s problems. But the city shouldn’t escape without fault, because the city provided the incentive — no, the reason — for general and equity applicants to form partnerships in the first place. 
Selna said NUG doesn’t blame Bronson for asking the city to revoke NUG’s letter of authorization. In fact, Selna attended the Joyous Wellness hearing and spoke to Thurston, Bronson’s attorney. The two sides are working to reach a settlement before their hearing. 
In the meantime, Bronson has watched his nursery business wilt. He said his clone-selling season is from February to June, when he makes most of his money for the year. 
Bronson has been trying to subsist by growing plants in the garage of his East Oakland home. Because he has limited space, he’s only been able to produce clones for popular strains like Purple Punch. He says his connections with dispensaries have dried up. 
“Because I can’t deliver a consistent experience,” Bronson said. “I don’t have enough room to produce clones week in, week out to compete with my competitors. This is allowing my competitors to get a leg up on me.” 
And that’s not what the equity program intended.

15,15,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/State-of-potheads-how-is-marijuana-now-11957164.php,State of potheads: How is marijuana now celebrated?,"At the risk of alienating essentially everyone in California, I’m just going to come right out and say this: I don’t like the smell of pot smoke. 
To me, it’s a cross between a decomposing animal and grilled cheese left on the stove too long. It’s not a happy smell; it’s the aroma of Market Street on a hot day, of lost jobs and bounced checks, of cold pizza and bad TV, of brain cells withering, of wet towels rumpled in a corner. 
And, as everyone knows, it’s now atmospheric. That’s because last year 7.9 million California voters, myself included, decided to legalize marijuana. Granted, it was pretty much legal already in that police didn’t really enforce marijuana laws, such as they are, but soon pot will be regulated and taxed around the state. It will be as legal as chocolate milk. 
Which means that rancid earthy stench will be a fixture of streetscapes and playgrounds and bar patios forever, from Crescent City to Chula Vista. Pot is now officially among the pantheon of socially acceptable vices, just like vodka tonics and Marlboro cigarettes and diet Coke. 
I have no issue with the legality. After all, life can be hard, and who am I to begrudge anyone an occasional escape? And no question, growers should comply with environmental laws and pay taxes like everyone else. 
But here’s what I do not understand: Diet soda, cigarettes and booze are recognized as exactly that — vices. They’re affixed with government warning labels and laden with “sin taxes.” Millions of people enjoy them, but there’s a universal acknowledgment that they’re not good for you. 
But pot seems exempt from that degenerate reputation. In fact, it’s almost celebrated as a health food. Illuminated billboards loom over Interstate 80, proclaiming in full-Vegas neon: Smoke-o-Rama! Pot Town! High and Mighty! Pot stores have come to resemble friendly neighborhood cafes. People walk down Main Street smoking pot like it’s no more unusual than chewing gum or chatting on their phones. 
I was at a social gathering the other day and everyone was debating the hallucinatory nuances of various strains of edibles, as if they were a Napa Pinot Noir. A whole new vocabulary is dawning — soon we’ll all know the micro-appellations of Humboldt and Mendocino counties, the names of well-respected growers, and clever new words for “stoned.” Just like we know the difference between Old Milwaukee and Pliny the Elder, and the difference between “slightly buzzed” and “throwing up.” It used to be just about seeds and stems; now it’s about vintage and varietals, as fetishized as the menu at a five-star restaurant in Yountville. 
But somewhere in all this drug mania we seem to have forgotten what every college freshman already knows: Pot makes you stupid. Or it will, if you smoke it enough. (Some people report great medical benefits from pot. This is not about them.) 
Is this something we really want to encourage on a mass scale? 
As the parent of teenagers, I can’t say I’m in favor of this. I spend a lot of time advising my children, “Don’t smoke pot. Don’t drink. Don’t do dumb things. Pass algebra. Don’t get arrested. Go to college. Do not bring shame upon me.” Needless to say, I am powerless next to the 40-foot “Welcome to Weed World!” billboard. 
And what about the smell? Why is it that, in some circles, wearing lavender hand cream is forbidden in deference to those who have fragrance sensitivities, and people recoil dramatically at the smell of cigarettes, but no one complains about pot smoke? Pot smoke is a million times stinkier than lavender hand cream! If Telegraph Avenue was awash in clouds of lavender, I might be more inclined to shop there. 
I suppose all of these contradictions are part of the long, dysfunctional continuum that is our love/hate relationship with drugs and booze. Opioids, which are legal, are now the source of a national emergency. Meanwhile, voters in some states are legalizing marijuana. Suburban moms brag on Facebook about getting drunk at book club meetings, while AA programs are busting at the seams. As a culture, we are sending mixed messages to the young ’uns. 
I’m looking forward to the day legal pot is no longer a novelty. Maybe it’ll settle in with all the other guilty pleasures and not be revered as some pseudo-spiritual health tonic. It can be accepted as a reliable, temporary source of relief in a harsh and unpredictable world, but not something you want to make a habit of or brag about. And maybe, just maybe, some Humboldt grower will find a way to make it smell like lavender.

16,16,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Berkeley-boy-was-Patient-X-in-first-13057044.php,Berkeley boy was ‘Patient X’ in first FDA-approved medicine derived from marijuana,"The Berkeley boy had his first epileptic seizure when he was 4, and after that, they kept coming, up to 100 a day. His desperate parents tried a barrage of two dozen medications, plus a high-fat medical diet and autoimmune therapy. 
But nothing worked — not until a British company let him try a marijuana-based drug. 
Sam Vogelstein, now 17, was the only patient in an early test that was unheard of in medical circles. The high-concentration cannabidiol strain had never been given to children and was illegal in the United States, even though the drug had been stripped of its high-inducing chemical. 
It worked. And now, after six years and a clinical trial led by UCSF, the drug is available for others. On June 25, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Epidiolex for treatment of two severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. 
It is the first time the FDA has approved a medicine derived from marijuana. It won’t work for every patient, but for Sam’s family, it’s everything. 
“What I went through, I know, was not normal,” said Sam, a junior at Sterne High School in San Francisco. “It’s not something anyone should have to go through. I hope I’m able to somehow make a large impact.” 
It started, seemingly, with a judo bow. 
Evelyn Nussenbaum and her husband, Fred Vogelstein, were saying goodbye to a college friend who had spent the evening at their home. Sam let his head drop, like a martial artist, then snapped it back. 
“Why did you do that?” his mother asked. 
“I don’t know,” the 4-year-old said. 
Two months passed. Sam did it again. This time, they were in New York visiting Vogelstein’s family. Sam bowed and didn’t know why. Soon, it was happening once a week. His twin, Beatrice, seemed unaffected. 
Definitely a nervous tick, Vogelstein said. Definitely something more, Nussenbaum replied. 
They fought about it, back and forth, not ready to receive a heavy truth. Eventually, they took Sam to the hospital for an electroencephalogram. 
“They said he had a seizure disorder,” Nussenbaum said. “I didn’t know that meant epilepsy. When I looked it up, my heart dropped. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, my God, it’s epilepsy.’” 
The misfiring of Sam’s electrical system changed the family’s trajectory. His disorder was an uncrackable riddle that doctors and medication could not solve. 
The boy fell down a flight of stairs. He cracked a window pane with his head, and went facedown in a plate of spaghetti. “Glad I don’t remember that one,” he said. He didn’t have grand mal seizures, characterized by collapsing and twitching on the ground. Instead, for five to 20 seconds, his face would go slack and he would seemingly leave his body. 
When Sam regained consciousness, things would be slightly different. At school, his classmates would angrily urge him — the line leader — forward. They didn’t understand why he was standing still. He would spend an hour learning a math formula, only to have a seizure and forget it. 
His life was like a scratched DVD; entire portions were missing. Some medications helped, but many didn’t. And their side effects were severe: anger, full-body rashes, or hallucinations that bugs were crawling from holes in his skin. 
More than 3.4 million people in the United States have epilepsy, but because of the brain’s complexity, relatively little is known about how to treat the disorder. As Sam got older, there were seemingly fewer options. Then Nussenbaum, a journalist who had given up her career to care for her son, found an article on cannabidiol in Seizure, a British medical journal. 
Maybe this was the secret. 
Known as CBD, the purified drug has no trace of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the euphoria-inducing chemical in marijuana. In one study, cannabidiol had stopped seizures in rodents. It could work for Sam, too, his parents thought. 
“We are out of options,” Nussenbaum thought. “How can I get cannabidiol?” 
She and her husband joined an underground cannabidiol collective, but when they tested what they received they found more THC than CBD in the concoction. They had a family friend buy marijuana from a dealer in Oakland and purify it in her kitchen. But the process was long and costly, and it made her suburban home smell like pot. There had to be a better way. 
Eventually, with the help of family friends, Nussenbaum and Vogelstein persuaded British company GW Pharmaceuticals to test a cannabis-based oil for epileptic children. The firm had previously gained market approval in the United Kingdom for another cannabis derivative, for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Sam would be their test dummy — the only one. 
The one-person trial had to be done overseas because the U.S. government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, the same tier as heroin. Sam’s parents paid thousands of dollars out of pocket for airfare, hotels and medical co-payments to make it possible. 
“I knew we were going on a trip to London for whatever medical reason,” Sam said. “I don’t think I really understood what was happening. But it changed my life.” 
Within days of traveling from Berkeley to London and taking the cannabidiol, Sam’s seizures plummeted from 68 to six per day, and then to zero. With no side effects. 
Dr. Maria Roberta Cilio moved from Rome to join UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in 2011 and had been appointed as a professor of neurology and pediatrics in 2012 when she met Sam. Though she was still relatively new, she began lobbying the FDA for a compassionate use trial, in which illegal drugs can be used outside of a clinical trial. 
“Sam’s life had completely changed because of CBD,” Cilio recalled. “For this particular patient, for him, it was a huge change.” 
After four months, the FDA approved the trial. But the Drug Enforcement Administration was less convinced. 
One day in 2013, agents unexpectedly showed up at Cilio’s office at UCSF and questioned her for two hours — a scene that reminded her of a crime show — about whether she had used drugs and how she would store the imported cannabidiol oil. In the end, they made her obtain a 965-pound safe for storing the medicine. 
That May, Cilio began giving Epidiolex to Sam. His parents had ordered a special hemp oil through the mail as a makeshift medication during the four-month interim period. It wasn’t as effective. 
Sam was the first patient to receive the drug, and 162 children and young adults in 11 epilepsy centers across the nation would follow, receiving 12-week courses of the drops. 
Cilio’s research, published in 2015 in the Lancet Neurology, showed a 36.5 percent average reduction in monthly motor seizures, which affect muscle activity. In the last month of the trial, she said, some patients who once had hundreds of seizures a day were completely free of them. 
“Drugs are normally only tested in adults first. This time, it was the opposite. The drug had never been used in humans, let alone children. It worked,” Cilio said. 
“I feel that we followed the right path that was not easy,” she said. “I was not pro, and I was not con, about marijuana. I took it as I would have done any drug. I wrote a protocol that was strict and rigorous and accurate, and this is the reason the FDA approved it for the first time.” 
How cannabidiol alleviates seizures at a molecular level, though, remains unclear. More studies are needed. 
Recently, on the anniversary of Sam’s seizures stopping, the family celebrated by making ice cream sundaes at their Berkeley home. They sprayed whip cream on each other’s faces, and Nussenbaum got a perfect beard and mustache. 
“Genius comes from the smallest of things,” Sam said, smiling. “I saw the can of whipped cream while my mom was shopping and knew just what I wanted to use it for.” 
Sam wants to get his driver’s license. He wants to be a counselor at an epilepsy camp so he can help other kids who went through what he did. He might even get a job at a comic book store. This fall, he’ll start competing in fencing. He knows these are all things someone suffering from severe seizures can’t do. But that’s not him anymore. 
Sometimes he thinks back to the London trip, when he first tried Epidiolex. On one of the last days, he went zip-lining 30 feet over Hyde Park, something that would have been unthinkable even a week earlier. For the first time in a long time, he felt like an average kid — and a healthy one. 
Flying through the air, he felt free. He wasn’t Patient X. He was just Sam.

17,17,CA,www.sfchronicle.com,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-marijuana-purveyors-go-mainstream-12532315.php,"California marijuana purveyors go mainstream, except for the sacks of cash","Bay Area marijuana retailers who went fully mainstream this month were forced to act like gangsters anyway as they rumbled down freeways and across bridges in sport utility vehicles and sedans and, in at least one case, a Tesla, bearing cash piled in shopping bags and suitcases. 
The money was headed for the collectors at the San Francisco and Oakland offices of the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, which are handling tax payments under the 2016 state law that legalized recreational cannabis. 
Everyone agrees the bundles of moola are a lure for criminals, but merchants who can’t access traditional banking have no other way to settle up. A month after California’s first recreational marijuana shops opened, the industry is mired in a fiscal free-for-all with few answers on how to handle the explosion of cash from rising sales and increased taxes. 
Industry leaders estimate that 70 percent of the more than 1,600 recreational and medical dispensaries in the state are still dealing in cash. They must lug stacks of 20s, 50s and 100s to the tax collector every month, payments that are growing after California on Jan. 1 initiated a 15 percent cannabis tax on top of sales taxes. 
The Wild West situation stems from marijuana remaining illegal under federal law, which prompts banks that might open accounts and extend loans to fear money-laundering charges. 
In the latest bid for a solution, state Sen. Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, introduced legislation Thursday that would allow state-chartered banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to open accounts and issue checks for marijuana retailers. 
Members of Congress have also sought protections, and Oakland and San Francisco have studied the idea of a public bank, but U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pushed in the other direction, signaling he favors a marijuana crackdown. 
Frustrated state Treasurer John Chiang urged California in November to hire armored cars to help pick up the taxes, which industry experts predict will top $1 billion a year. But many courier services are fearful of being targeted by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, and nothing has been done. 
Instead, 90 percent of all cash tax payments to the state are now made by the cannabis industry, officials said. 
“Certainly it’s an impediment to doing business,” said Erich Pearson, the founder of the San Francisco Patient and Resource Center, or SPARC, the city’s largest cannabis outlet. “A lack of banking has all sorts of logistical and operational challenges ... so you have safes and cameras and security.” 
The issue has intensified since Jan. 1, when the state put new taxes on retailers, growers and manufacturers. California businesses must normally pay a penalty for dealing in cash, but those in the cannabis trade can obtain a waiver, officials said. 
Recent events in San Francisco and Oakland have only worsened the cash-only dilemma. The San Francisco tax collector closed in the fall after the office was accidentally flooded, forcing dozens of marijuana purveyors to drive to Oakland or Sacramento. The office reopened Jan. 22. 
Earlier this month, the Oakland tax office became so swamped with currency that officials notified retailers it would only accept $20,000 in cash a day — a move that would have required some businesses to make multiple trips. The limit was rescinded shortly after The Chronicle inquired about it. 
Tax authorities could not provide data on how much cash they are receiving and from how many businesses, but shop owners in San Francisco said it was not uncommon for them to haul in $80,000 at a time. 
While no recent robberies have been reported publicly, dispensary workers across the country have fallen victim to cash heists over the years, including an Orange County dispensary owner who was kidnapped in 2012 and sexually tortured by four thieves trying to force him to hand over money. Another risk is that police or federal agents might confiscate gains considered ill-gotten. 
“It’s a burden for the whole industry,” said Erick Alfaro, director of operations for the Green Cross in San Francisco, whose boss Kevin Reed had to make two trips to Oakland in his Tesla to pay taxes this month. “Walking around with that large amount of money is definitely a danger and a safety concern for us.” 
Before January, medical dispensaries were required to pay state sales taxes that amounted to around $50 million annually, plus varying local taxes. Officials said only about a third of dispensaries paid all they owed — a shortfall that became one of the arguments for legalization. 
The newly raised taxes will pay for marijuana research and regulation as well as programs to prevent drug abuse, protect the environment and test for pesticides. 
Despite the windfall, bank managers contemplating opening cannabis accounts remain wary, and got no encouragement from Attorney General Sessions, who on Jan. 4 rescinded a memo issued under President Barack Obama’s administration that instructed the Department of Justice to leave cannabis businesses alone in states where the drug is legal. 
“It would be ridiculous for banks like ours to bank in marijuana,” said Jim Brush, the president and chief executive of Summit State Bank in Santa Rosa, a state-chartered institution subject to federal regulation. 
“Anytime we think there is anything to do with marijuana, we have to report that as suspicious activity because its illegal,” Brush said. “I have heard of some banks that have started it, but usually within a few months they aren’t doing it anymore. The fines can be substantial.” 
Before Sessions rescinded the Obama administration directive, known as the Cole memo, 400 banks in the country had cannabis customers, according to a September 2017 study by the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. 
It isn’t clear how many banks have cut ties since. Industry experts say the institutions that remain are mostly small credit unions or banks where branch managers negotiate side deals without telling their corporate bosses about the clients’ marijuana connection. 
Such arrangements can be fleeting, and many merchants have been forced to move from one institution to another as audits flag their accounts. Henry Wykowski, an attorney who represents Oakland’s Harborside dispensary and more than 100 other cannabis businesses in California, said he was bounced by Comerica Inc. after 25 years as a client, apparently after they found out he was depositing legal fees paid in cash by the dispensary. 
Other outlets wire money to banks or use debit cards and ATM processing machines supplied by independent merchant-services groups, like CreditWeed and Green Kinex. But the fees can be 5 percent or more per transaction. 
“We do receive inquiries from different companies offering credit card terminals, but there are quite a bit of fees,” said Alfaro, who recently received an offer with a 10-percent overall charge. “That wouldn’t be a really efficient way for us to run our business. It would be like them being a part-owner.” 
Wykowski said the restrictions may open doors for drug cartels, which have experience dealing in cash and providing the kind of muscle needed to protect it. 
“Not allowing cannabis businesses to engage in banking is actually detrimental to the federal government because there are now billions of dollars on the underground economy and all of it is cash that you can’t track,” Wykowski said. “Most businesses have found some type of accommodation, but the accommodation we have found is putting duct tape on the leaky pipe rather than replacing it.”

			Marijuana shops will have glut of cheap weed, followed by a possible shortage		
","Cannabis consumers soon should be able to shop at licensed stores in California without worrying about whether products on the shelves are laced with pesticides and other contaminants often found in black-market weed. 
Customers also will be able to see, on the package, how potent their products are, where they came from, and what other ingredients are used in any cannabis-infused edibles. 
But all that will be true once new state-mandated safety standards for marijuana kick in July 1. Until then, consumers can expect to see something of a cannabis roller coaster. 
For the next few weeks, retailers will do what they can to move stockpiles of untested product left over from California’s unregulated gray market. What they can’t sell by July 1, in theory, they’ll have to destroy. 
And once the old inventory is cleared out, experts say, licensed shops might be looking at a very different problem — a cannabis shortage. 
Many marijuana shops loaded up on inventory in late 2017, before California, on New Years Day, launched legal recreational marijuana sales and imposed hundreds of pages of ew rules for the cannabis industry. 
State regulators gave businesses a six-month grace period to sell off their old stockpiles, as long as the packaging told customers that the product didn’t meet new state standards. But sales this year have been slower than expected, and many shops still have lots of unsold inventory, said Josh Drayton, spokesman for the California Cannabis Industry Association. 
Retailers were hoping the state might extend the grace period on some products, but that’s not happening. Over the past week, the Bureau of Cannabis Control sent out reminder notices telling retailers that the new rules will be firm starting July 1. 
“We gave everyone six months to use up their supply on hand and get ready for the new standards that were coming July 1,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the state’s cannabis bureau. “We felt like that was a sufficient amount of transition time.” 
Here are the new cannabis regulations that kick in July 1. 
— Products must be tested in a licensed lab. Tests must check for levels of THC, the compound in cannabis that makes people high, and CBD, the compound thought to have the most medical benefits. They also must check for contaminants such as pesticides and fungus. 
— Products must be properly labeled. Labels must include lab results, a universal symbol for cannabis products, the date the product was made and a safety warning. Edibles also must list ingredients and nutrition information. And no products can include cartoons, the word “candy,” or make unproven health claims. 
— There will be new THC limits. Edibles will only be allowed to have 100 milligrams of THC per package, and they must be delineated into 10-milligram servings. Nonedible cannabis products, such as oils and topicals, will only be allowed to have 1,000 milligrams of THC if they’re for recreational consumers. They can have 2,000 milligrams of THC if they’re sold to medical marijuana patients. 
— Products must come in child-resistant packaging. The state has been letting retailers put products in child-resistant packaging at the time of sale. But starting July 1, distributors will have to seal marijuana products in child-resistant packaging before sending them to stores. 
One rule that was set to apply July 1 — requiring medical and recreational cannabis retailers to work with only medical and recreational suppliers, respectively — has been dropped out of concern that it would create shortages in the cannabis supply chain. 
But some experts are still worried about bottlenecks in other segments of the industry. 
For example, the Bureau of Cannabis Control has licensed just 28 labs statewide, so far, and a number of those haven’t yet opened their doors. 
In theory, with less than three weeks left before the licensing rules kick in, that should have led to a glut of products in the licensing pipeline. But for Steep Hill lab in Berkeley, while there has been an uptick in business, it hasn’t been as big as expected, according to chief revenue officer Tony Daniel. 
“We were a little surprised that more growers and producers weren’t coming to the labs to make sure that their products were going to survive compliance,” Daniel said. He noted that many businesses seemingly skirt the rules for as long as possible so they can pocket the 1 to 5 percent that testing adds to wholesale prices. 
Steep Hill more than doubled in size in recent months, leading up to the July 1 deadline, Daniel said. So, when business begins to surge in the next few weeks, he doesn’t expect any delays in turnaround time. 
But Daniel also said companies that haven’t had their products tested could be in for a rude awakening if they discover they have clean-up work to do before they can send items to market. That, in turn, could leave shops without enough legal product to sell. 
The degree to which California’s marijuana industry falls in line with the new policies — or continues pushing product to the state’s still-thriving black market — will depend largely on whether the state puts teeth into its rules, Daniel said. 
“Regulation without enforcement is completely worthless,” he said. 
The Bureau of Cannabis Control has been doing compliance checks all over the state, Traverso said, and will continue those checks after July 1. 
But the state has largely been issuing warning notices, giving businesses time to comply with the new rules. And state funds to support stepped-up enforcement have so far been stripped from the budget. 
As tough as the environment is for regulated businesses, Drayton of the Cannabis Industry Association is urging cannabis entrepreneurs to be proactive about compliance and to support the safety rules set to kick in July 1. 
“We fought for legalization with public safety and public health in mind,” he said. 
“This date needed to happen at some point.”

			State gives marijuana businesses more time for compliance		
","The transition to a fully regulated cannabis industry is taking California a bit longer than anticipated. 
While state regulators scramble to extend temporary marijuana business licenses, they’re also considering whether to extend a grace period that gives operators extra time to comply with strict new industry standards. 
As of Monday, a tenth of the 6,000 temporary cannabis licenses state regulators have issued were set to expire by May 1, which marks the four-month anniversary of the start of legal recreational marijuana sales in California. A third of all existing licenses were due to lapse by the start of June. 
The state hasn’t issued any full annual licenses yet. And the first approvals are likely still at least four weeks out. 
Instead, regulators are extending provisional permits for another 90 days while businesses deal with complex regulations, backlogs in getting local approval and, it seems, their own procrastination. 
“Part of the problem, I think, is that people wait until the last minute,” said Lori Ajax, chief of California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control. “I’m a procrastinator sometimes. I get it, so I’m not upset.” 
Only 278 businesses had even applied for annual licenses as of April 25. That includes just 24 cultivators, 61 manufacturers and 193 retailers, distributors or testers, according to figures provided by the three agencies regulating marijuana businesses. 
If businesses don’t get complete applications in before their temporary permits expire, they’ll be required to shut down until however long it takes them to get annual authorization. Ajax said her staff will inspect sites to insure compliance. 
Still, neither state regulators nor industry insiders seem too concerned about the slow pace of processing, with everyone confident that a coming flood of temporary permit extensions will take care of the problem. 
State regulators created simple temporary licenses, good for 120 days, so they could hit a mandated Jan. 1 target to launch recreational sales and regulate all segments of California’s massive marijuana market for the first time. 
The goal was to give marijuana business owners time to compile the additional information needed to get annual licenses, including security plans, insurance bonds, business formation documents and fingerprinting for all owners. It also gave the state time to review and verify conditions needed for annual licenses, such as local approval. 
The temporary licenses came with an optional 90-day extension. Now it seems all businesses will need to take advantage of that provision. 
Delays in licensing don’t seem to be happening at the state level. In fact, industry operators say state agencies have been extremely prompt about processing applications and responsive in answering questions that pop up along the way. 
“When you think about the herculean task they had, they did a really good job,” said Rob Bernheimer, chief counselor for Irvine-based Cultivation Technologies. 
But the requirement that operators show they have permission from their local jurisdiction before they can get a state license has proven particularly challenging. 
While the Bureau of Cannabis Control had approved 1,779 licenses as of April 25, Ajax said they’d denied another 1,150 license applications. About 90 percent of the denials were issued because businesses didn’t have approval form their city or county to set up shop. 
More than two-thirds of California cities don’t allow any cannabis businesses at all, according to a statewide database of policies compiled by the Southern California News Group. 
Some cities and counties that do have policies on the books to allow the industry have been slow in rolling out local permits. Sonoma and Nevada counties, for example, have substantial backlogs in processing local applications to grow cannabis, according to Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association trade group. 
The application process itself also is challenging, Allen said, noting that he’s seen annual license applications that were 300 pages long. 
It took Bernheimer and his team of dedicated staff about a month to put together all of the information needed in the four separate annual license applications they submitted to manufacture and distribute both medical and recreational cannabis out of Coachella. 
Then there are the fees associated with state annual licenses, which range from $800 up to $120,000 a year, depending on the business type and size. Allen said some small cultivators are being priced out of business, particularly when state fees are added to the fees associated with local permits and the price of operational upgrades needed to comply with new regulations. 
Given these challenges, Ajax said the state is also considering extending a grace period they offered businesses to comply with portions of the hundreds of pages of new state regulations. That includes letting shops sell inventory that doesn’t meet new testing and packaging requirements, and allowing businesses to keep working with other licensed operators without worrying about whether their permits are for medical and recreational activities. 
That grace period is set to expire July 1. But many stores stocked up on inventory before new regulations kicked in, so Ajax said owners are saying they’re still going to have lots of unsold product if that July 1 date sticks. Also, she said giving operators more time before they have additional limits on who they can do business with will probably be needed to help avoid any hiccups in the supply chain. 
We saw supply chain issues in other states as they struggled to launch regulated cannabis markets. In Nevada, for example, a delay in licensing distributors meant retailers were running out of product just days after recreational marijuana sales launched there on July 1, 2017. 
California regulators say they’re proud to report they haven’t had those kinds of issues here, even while rolling out licenses and rules for the world’s largest legal marijuana market. 
Extending temporary permits and the grace period on some compliance issues will help them maintain a steady flow of licensed product, Ajax said. But it also means it will likely be late summer before California cannabis consumers can be sure products they’re buying have been lab tested, tracked from seed to sale, sold by vendors that have cleared background checks and passed other security measures. 
Meanwhile, the state is also busy creating final regulations for the cannabis industry. 
Businesses are now operating under 276 pages of emergency regulations issued in mid-November. California’s Cannabis Advisory Committee has been meeting to discuss changes to these rules, and Ajax said she expects quite a few adjustments once final plans come out in perhaps two months. 
Some issues on the table are possibly loosening hours of operation for retailers, limits on delivery services and a requirement that vertically integrated businesses must use distributors to move products even on their own campuses, Ajax said. 
“There’s plenty of room for improvement and we’re OK with that because I just think that makes for a better product,” she said. 
As final rules are approved and temporary permits expire, Ajax said the state does plan to step up enforcement in the second half of 2018. 
They’ve already sent out cease and desist letters to nearly 1,000 businesses that don’t seem to have made any attempt to comply with new state laws, including the giant dispensary-mapping service Weedmaps. Soon, Ajax said her small agency will begin partnering with the Department of Consumers and local law enforcement to shut down unlicensed businesses. 
But even at that stage, Ajax said they’ll still be taking into consideration operators who are trying to get local permits or otherwise follow the rules, since the goal is to move as many businesses as possible into the regulated marketplace. 
“It’s not as black and white as a regulator would like it to be,” she said. “But I think there just comes a point where we’ve got to cut it off.”

			Marijuana landlord turns activist, arguing local policies are slowing legal weed		
","Stephanie Smith was balancing one of her 2-year-old twins on a hip during a quiet morning in December when she heard a commotion outside her home in Los Angeles’ affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood. 
Someone began banging on her front door. As she moved to open it, she saw a line of police officers in her front yard and red laser gun sights coming through the windows, bouncing off her and her children. 
Officers searched her home. They found and took blueprints for a kitchen remodel project and her cell phone. 
At the same time, 80 miles due east in San Bernardino, dozens of officers were raiding two warehouses and another home owned by Smith. They seized nearly 25,000 marijuana plants and arrested eight men for growing cannabis in the three locations without city permits. 
Smith wasn’t arrested or fined. But headlines the next day painted the 43-year-old as a “queenpin” and the “mastermind” of a multimillion-dollar illegal marijuana-growing operation. 
“To be labeled a ‘drug lord’ in international press was a surprise,” she said. 
“I don’t even have house plants.” 
Though the mother of five boasts that she’s the biggest cannabis landlord in California, Smith insists she’s just that, a landlord. She says she isn’t involved with the marijuana businesses ran by her tenants. 
Smith also insists her San Bernardino clients weren’t hiding. She says they’re part of California’s entrenched cannabis industry that’s struggling to join the emerging legal market, and that those efforts are being hampered by “corrupt” and “regressive” city policies. 
Smith shrank from public attention when she was part of a very different scandal a decade ago, legally changing her last name to something that’s as anonymous as it can get. 
This time, she says she’s fighting back. 
Smith has filed lawsuits against San Bernardino and three other Inland Empire cities over their marijuana policies. And she’s floating marijuana ballot measures in six communities, determined to make conditions fairer for the industry that’s been so good to her. 
Smith, whose name at birth was Stephanie Darcy, was raised in Minneapolis by a single working mom. She grew up dreaming of being an artist, and she still nurses a passion for painting. 
After studying marketing in Boston, and using her artist’s eye to flip houses in the Phoenix area, she moved to Southern California in 2005 to attend business school at UCLA. 
She was dating and working for Dr. Craig Alan Bittner, who had a successful liposuction practice in Beverly Hills. Things were going well until 2008, when a trio of lawsuits claimed Bittner had let Smith perform botched liposuction procedures even though she had no medical training. The lawsuits were eventually dismissed. 
“At the end of the day, I made a regulatory mistake a decade ago and paid a $242 fine,” Smith said. 
Things got more complicated when authorities caught wind that Bittner was violating medical waste laws by using fat removed from his patients to power his and Smith’s cars. 
Smith said the intent with “LipoDiesel” was never to suggest that people could actually run their vehicles on human fat. She said it was simply a way to illustrate what was possible if people opened their minds to alternative energy sources. And she said they asked permission from every client, with all but one of some 8,000 patients enthusiastically consenting. 
There was no word for internet “trolls” then, but Smith said she was intimidated into silence. 
“If I could go back in time, I would have talked very openly about our goals for changing our view of energy,” she said. “I would have talked about my passion for the environment instead of being afraid.” 
Smith’s foray into another controversial industry started as a favor. 
With the housing market in crisis a decade ago, Smith dove into commercial real estate. 
A friend of a friend was growing cannabis under California’s loose medical marijuana laws as he put himself through law school in 2009. But he was struggling to find space to house his operation, with local and federal policies that made it risky for landlords to take on marijuana tenants. 
Smith says she’s never been a “hardcore” marijuana consumer herself. “But like a lot of people, I wanted the laws changed.” So she let the small-time grower lease one of her L.A. properties. 
The tenant finished law school and moved on. So Smith put the site back on the market, thinking its water and power stations would make for a good laundromat or nail salon. 
She said she had no idea then that anyone would recognize signs of a grow house. But 45 minutes after the property went up on Craigslist, a cultivator offered double the asking price. Soon, she was in a bidding war, eventually landing a grower who paid three times the requested rent.

Today, she said her company, Industrial Partners Group, owns two million square feet of industrial space. Most of it is in Southern California, but she has property as far north as Sacramento. And, while she rents buildings to Walmart and bakeries, many of her warehouses are leased to cannabis growers and manufacturers. 
One reason Smith believes she’s been so successful is that many cannabis entrepreneurs were accustomed to dealing with landlords who refused to sign leases or made them use fake names so they could feign ignorance. Smith said she tried to “inject some professionalism” by treating them like other valuable tenants. 
She’s also discreet. 
B-Real, stage name for lead Cypress Hill rapper Louis Freese, leases a Downtown L.A. warehouse from Smith. When asked if she has any other famous tenants, Smith pauses, flashes her frequent smile and says: “I have a nice reputation among hip-hop and sports celebrities.” 
Smith considers her work with the industry a form of activism. But this election cycle, she says, is different. 
“This is my first time taking it to the streets.” 
Smith wore a gray cotton shirt, jeans and colorful sneakers on a recent Friday evening as she joined a political support team canvassing San Bernardino’s Verdemont neighborhood. The goal is to collect the 8,602 signatures needed to get her proposed cannabis measure on the November ballot. 
Residents seemed largely receptive, though they’ve been through this before. 
When Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana under Proposition 64 in 2016, San Bernardino voters also approved Measure O, which laid out a framework for cannabis businesses to operate in town. 
The measure was needed because Prop. 64 gives cities the rights to regulate businesses in their borders. And a study of local marijuana policies shows more than two-thirds of cities in California still bans all marijuana ventures. 
San Bernardino awarded its first business permit under Measure O last year, to the owners of Flesh Showgirls. They now run a strip club in one half of the building and Captain Jack’s marijuana dispensary in the other. 
But multiple lawsuits were filed over Measure O, and in December a judge threw the initiative out because, he said, it used spot zoning to create a monopoly that allowed just two shops in town. That ruling is being appealed. 
Smith says her San Bernardino tenants had applied at least eight times for licenses to operate their businesses legally under Measure O, inviting city officials to inspect their high-end security and odor filtration systems. 
A week after the raids, she said two of the tenants received letters from the city saying they could legally grow marijuana if they paid $140,000 in fees. Smith said they paid up but still haven’t been cleared to operate, leaving 100 people out of work. And she said police have been called 10 times since the raids over reports of vandalism and homeless people squatting in the vacant buildings. 
The city is now accepting applications under its own licensing scheme. But a new policy says companies previously deemed to be operating illegally aren’t eligible for permits, leaving Smith’s clients with no route to run legal cannabis businesses in San Bernardino. 
City and police officials declined to comment on any of Smith’s claims, citing pending and potential litigation. 
Spurred by what happened in San Bernardino, Smith has filed additional lawsuits against Colton, Hemet and Moreno Valley. 
Concerns raised in the suits include Colton’s requirement that residents get permission from the city if they want to grow marijuana plants at home for personal use, as allowed under Prop. 64. And that anyone working for a marijuana business in Moreno Valley, from contractors to janitors, first get a city permit. 
Her team is also collecting signatures for marijuana ballot measures in Colton, Hemet, Upland, Bakersfield and Kern County. 
The initiatives are tailored for each area, Smith said. That means Central Valley policies support a cultivation-heavy market while San Bernardino is encouraged to put its affordable industrial properties to work by becoming a manufacturing hub, making vape pens and edibles popular with cannabis consumers. 
California is close to an inflection point, Smith believes, where marijuana businesses won’t have to hide or beg cities to let them in. When that happens, Smith said she hopes Southern California cities will have fair policies in place that position them to compete for the jobs and tax revenue the cannabis industry can generate. 
And Smith, of course, will have properties ready to house those valuable tenants.

22,22,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/04/09/database-of-marijuana-rules-from-every-city-and-county-in-california-shows-slow-acceptance-of-prop-64/,"

			Marijuana laws for every city and county? Our database shows California slow to accept Prop. 64		
","Fewer than one in three California cities (144 out of 482) allow any kind of cannabis business to operate in their borders. And just 18 of the state’s 58 counties permit cannabis businesses in their unincorporated areas. 
Also, fewer than one in five California cities welcome medical marijuana dispensaries, while fewer than one in seven allow recreational cannabis stores, where anyone 21 and older has been able to shop for legal weed since Jan. 1. 
These are some of the findings in a first-of-its-kind investigation, tracking and compiling the cannabis ordinances in all 540 city and county jurisdictions in California, a study conducted by Southern California News Group and other Digital First newspapers. 
The information opens a window into how the industry is taking shape three months after California began licensing marijuana businesses and permitting the sale of recreational marijuana. 
The study is needed because of a simple rule in California: While Proposition 64 (approved by 57 percent of state voters in November 2016) makes it legal for people to carry up to an ounce of marijuana and to grow it at home and consume it for pleasure, the law also gives cities and counties a strong say in how that law is implemented within their jurisdictions. 
That dichotomy has led to a crazy quilt of policies across the state. Some towns are cannabis friendly, allowing a wide range of businesses related to a product that residents are free to use at their discretion. Other cities are less enthusiastic, with some blocking virtually every type of marijuana-related enterprise and, in some cases, passing ordinances that seem aimed at regulating personal use as much as possible. 
Last year, to help everyone from pot consumers and would-be pot entrepreneurs to people who simply are curious about the progress of a new state law, we began gathering details on local marijuana policies. In January, we launched a database with some of that information, offering cannabis rules from about half the cities in the state. Today, we’ve upgraded that work, with rules from every city and county in California. 
The information is included in our online database, where readers can search policies by location or by business type. And, based on an analysis of that data, we’ve ranked each community on our 100-point scale of marijuana friendliness. 
The data reveals some interesting trends, conflicts and anomalies. It also shows that leaders in some communities are far less enthusiastic (or, in some cases, more enthusiastic) about cannabis than the residents who voted for or against Prop 64. That’s one reason the database shows city-by-city voting results, too. 
Today’s story is the first in a three-part series. Next up is a story about how some city laws seem to paint cannabis as a barely-legal product, and after that will come a story about how a few cities are particularly eager to make money off the cannabis industry. 
(Read Part 2 and Part 3) 
We’ll continue exploring and expanding the data so, down the road, we can offer more insights about the multi-billion-dollar world of legal cannabis in California. 
Many people seem to think it’s a free-for-all when it comes to cannabis in California now that recreational marijuana is legal. But that’s far from the case, as many cities are setting up strict rules on what types of cannabis businesses — if any — can open in their town. 
And even the numbers that seem to indicate where the cannabis industry is being welcomed can paint an overly enthusiastic picture. A couple dozen cities on the chart — places such as Moreno Valley and Davis — have passed rules to allow marijuana businesses. But that data doesn’t show how those cities have yet to fully develop the regulations, or issue permits, to let those businesses start. 
That’s why even though 61 cities and nine counties have ordinances on the books that allow recreational marijuana stores, as of April 6, 2018, the state Bureau of Cannabis Control had licensed recreational shops in only 34 cities and five unincorporated county areas of California. 
Here’s a map of shops licensed to sell recreational cannabis. 
A couple dozen cities are leading the pack for the most points we’ve doled out so far, meaning they’re the most lenient cities in the state when it comes to cannabis policy. 
(If the graphics with this story are unresponsive, refresh this page.) 
Riverside County has by far the highest number of permissive cities, with six that score above 96 points on our scale. A few other counties have two 96-point cities each, including Los Angeles and Sonoma. 
Four counties are also racking up points when it comes to their lenient policies for unincorporated areas: Humboldt, Inyo, Del Norte and Monterey. 
To get above 96 points, cities and counties must allow every type of marijuana business licensed by the state. That means permitting medical and recreational licenses for cannabis sales, cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and testing. They would also have to allow their residents to grow marijuana at home, both indoors and outdoors. 
No one yet has a score of 100 is because we reserved a few points in our scale for cities that go a step further and allow, say, cannabis lounges or festivals. We’ll be incorporating these factors as we continue to build out the database, with cities such as Palm Springs and San Francisco — which permit cannabis lounges — expected to jump even higher. 
(Note: We don’t mean to imply that “high” scores are better or worse than “low” scores. If you support cannabis rights, you’ll likely see a high score as a good thing. If you oppose them, you’ll likely see a low score as preferable. Our scoring system is simply a mathematical way to compare city and county policies.) 
More than five dozen cities score a zero on our scale of cannabis friendliness. 
These cities are spread over 26 counties. The highest number is predictably in the county with by far the most cities: Los Angeles. But just 19 percent of L.A. County cities are super strict on cannabis, while every city in the tiny counties of Madera and Sutter have passed the toughest rules possible. 
Perhaps the biggest surprise is in Humboldt County, which is famous for cannabis production. Despite the region’s reputation as a cannabis hotbed, and despite having a couple cities where cannabis ordinances are lenient, four of the seven cities in Humboldt County earn zero points on our scale. 
To get a zero score, a city has to ban all marijuana businesses, block residents from growing marijuana for personal use outdoors and require them to get a permit to grow it inside their homes. 
So far, counties have been slightly more likely than cities to welcome marijuana businesses. 
The gap is most pronounced when it comes to shops and cultivation. More than 15 percent of California counties allow recreational stores in unincorporated areas, for example, compared with 12 percent of cities. And 27 percent of counties allow medical marijuana cultivation, compared with just 20 percent of cities. 
In some places, county policies contrast sharply with some of the rules passed by cities within that county. 
Imperial County, for example, permits all types of marijuana businesses in its unincorporated areas, mostly near the Arizona and Mexico borders. Yet most cities in Imperial County (the three biggest are El Centro, Calexico and Brawley) have banned the industry, and none allow recreational shops. 
There are also state-licensed marijuana stores that claim addresses in Carmel and Monterey, even though both of those cities block all marijuana businesses. 
The shops are technically in unincorporated Monterey County, which allows all types of marijuana businesses. Same goes for a recreational shop “in Crescent City” that’s actually in unincorporated Del Norte County, and another with an address “in Fort Bragg” though it’s officially in unincorporated Mendocino County. 
In some cities and counties, cannabis industry rules contrast sharply with how residents there voted on Prop. 64. 
In the top left corner of the chart you’ll find cities and counties where local leaders have passed liberal marijuana policies even though most of their constituents voted against Prop. 64. 
Imperial County again stands out. Only 45 percent of unincorporated county residents there voted in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana. But the Imperial County Board of Supervisors voted in November to welcome every type of cannabis business, giving the area a score of 95.9 on our scale of permissiveness. 
Oakdale and Riverbank, in Stanislaus County, are the only two cities in the state that welcome every type of recreational marijuana business even though a majority of residents in both cities voted against Prop. 64. 
The opposite can be seen in the bottom right corner of the chart, which shows cities and counties where local leaders are sticking with strict cannabis policies even though more than two thirds of the voters in their communities were in favor of Prop. 64. 
In Sausalito, in Marin County, 77 percent of voters supported legal weed, but city council members there have blocked all businesses and outdoor home gardens. The numbers are similar in the Bay Area city of Albany. 
In other places, local policies are very much in line with voter wishes. 
West Hollywood and Berkeley voters, for example, tied with a high of 83 percent of residents approving Prop. 64. Both cities also have liberal cannabis policies, just missing the leader board for most permissive cities in the state because they block commercial cultivation and other behind-the-scenes businesses. 
Kingsburg, in Fresno County, also has policies that align with election numbers. Residents of the farming town opposed Prop. 64 more than anywhere else in California, with only 35 percent favoring marijuana legalization. And city council members have taken a similar stance, with policies that earn Kingsburg 0.5 out of 100 points on our scale of marijuana friendliness.

			Israeli marijuana researchers to open first U.S. clinic in Laguna Woods		
","Israel has been, for decades, the global leader in medical marijuana research and treatment, with the government funding human clinical trials even as the United States and other countries discouraged or criminalized such studies. 
Now, a company formed by doctors and nurses involved in some of Israel’s pioneering cannabis research is working to open its first American clinic in Laguna Woods. 
Israel-based NiaMedic is promising to offer conventional medical care alongside what company leaders describe as research-backed cannabis treatment aimed at seniors. The focus will be on the use of cannabis to handle pain management, physical rehabilitation, insomnia and other conditions linked to aging. 
“Right now, it’s scary to get older,” said Alon Blatt, NiaMedic’s director of business development. “We’re showing people that there’s a better way.” 
The clinic is on track to open in late August, just outside the gates to Laguna Woods Village. Though an exact location isn’t nailed down, Blatt said they already have a list of roughly 100 local seniors hoping to sign on as patients. 
“I’m very enthusiastic about this,” said Shari Horne, a Laguna Woods councilwoman who occasionally relies on medical marijuana. 
“I think there’s so much potential.” 
The demographics of Laguna Woods, and the community’s progressive stance on medical marijuana, make the age-restricted town an ideal setting for NiaMedic’s first U.S. clinic, according to Blatt. 
Laguna Woods is an incorporated city, but one that’s comprised almost entirely of Laguna Woods Village, a gated retirement community. Home prices are comparatively affordable, amenities are abundant and the 16,400 residents make up one of America’s oldest communities — with a median age of about 75, according to Census data. 
Since cannabis has been shown to effectively treat conditions that plague people in that age range — including certain types of chronic pain, spasms and appetite problems — people over 65 are one of the fastest-growing segments of cannabis consumers in the United States. 
What’s more, cannabis already has something of a toe-hold in Laguna Woods. 
In 2008, Laguna Woods became the first city in Orange County to pass an ordinance allowing medical marijuana dispensaries. But a lack of viable commercial space, and pressure from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, prevented a cannabis shop from ever opening in town. And in April 2017, the council reversed its rules, voting to block all marijuana-related businesses. 
But over the years, hundreds of area residents have consumed cannabis through the Laguna Woods Medical Cannabis Club, a collective founded by a resident, Lonnie Painter, and staffed by volunteer “peer guides.” Members of the club, also known as a collective, have been able to get information about how to use medical marijuana and buy lab-tested cannabis products sourced by Painter. 
However, because of new state laws related to cannabis, the collective will have to get a license to sell cannabis directly, or dissolve, by the end of 2018. Since Laguna Woods’ city ordinances no longer permits marijuana sales, it looks likes the town’s Cannabis Club will be defunct in less than six months.

Paradoxically, Proposition 64 — which this year legalized recreational cannabis sales in California — establishes some guidelines that can make life trickier for some medical consumers. 
As part of the law, Californians no longer need a doctor’s recommendation to buy cannabis. And, because of that, many doctors who used to meet with “patients” and offer up medical recommendations have been shutting down their practices. 
Bud and Bloom, a licensed dispensary in Santa Ana, saw this problem as an opportunity. Last year, the company started sending a bus to Laguna Woods once a month, offering regular consumers and the merely curious a free ride to consult with cannabis experts and buy product from the Bud and Bloom shop on St. Gertrude Place. 
But with the Laguna Woods collective scheduled to sunset, residents with serious medical conditions are afraid that, come January, they’ll face a gap when it comes to getting reliable information and access to cannabis. 
Enter NiaMedic. 
The company was co-founded by Inbal Sikorin, an Israeli nurse known internationally as an advocate for using cannabis to help geriatric patients deal with age-related conditions. 
Early in her career, Sikorin opposed marijuana use. But the family of a patient in a nursing home outside Tel Aviv asked if Sikorin would consider using cannabis to help their mom, who was in constant pain and relied on a feeding tube. Sikorin said marijuana transformed that patient, and others in her care, and she quickly became a leading researcher on using cannabis to treat dementia, pain and other conditions. Her work has drawn interest from celebrity medical types such as TV host Montel Williams and neurosurgeon Dr. Sunjay Gupta. 
Sikorin and partners launched NiaMedic two years ago as a way to bridge the gap between the mainstream medical world and the exploding cannabis industry. In Israel, two NiaMedic clinics have treated roughly 800 patients whose average age was 78. 
While the hub for medical marijuana research remains Israel, Blatt notes the biggest market for cannabis is in the United States. So NiaMedic has set up its U.S. headquarters in West Hollywood and selected Laguna Woods for its first local facility. 
Councilwoman Horne, among others, believes cannabis can help ease some forms of chronic pain and, therefore, could help ease the opioid epidemic that’s plaguing Laguna Woods and other U.S. communities. 
“It’s not for everyone, or every medical condition,” Horne said of cannabis. But she added that she regularly hears from hears from residents who say cannabis works as an opioid substitute. 
Without much regulated cannabis research in the United States, and with few doctors willing to offer advice on the drug’s potential uses, U.S. cannabis patients typically are left to experiment when it comes to products and doses. But Horne said one element of the NiaMedic model — a database with information from thousands of people treated by Sikorin and others — could be particularly helpful as a guide for local patients trying to sort out which type of cannabis to use for a particular condition. 
Patients at the Laguna Woods clinic also will add to that research, since Blatt said they’ll monitor — without names — how treatment methods stack up against results. 
NiaMedic will be staffed by doctors and nurses who focus on geriatrics, pain management, neurology, psychiatry and physical rehabilitation. While the clinic will cater to Laguna Woods seniors, Blatt said they’ll treat patients of any age, from any location. And cannabis will be “just one tool” in a broader toolbox. 
A typical first visit will cost $350. Though that’s not currently covered by insurance (Blatt says they’re hoping to change that), the fee covers a full health assessment, a lengthy consultation, treatment planning and a month of routine monitoring. 
Patients also can chose to become NiaMedic members. They’ll then pay $100 a month and $150 for each visit. 
The fees won’t include the cannabis. Just as traditional medical clinics use pharmacies to dispense opioids or antibiotics, NiaMedic won’t sell cannabis directly to patients. Instead, Blatt said they’re developing partnerships with cannabis cultivators and manufacturers, and with area dispensaries, so they can send patients to stores that carry what they deem to be appropriate cannabis products. 
While the company is developing the standalone clinic in Laguna Woods, Blatt said NiaMedic nurses trained in using cannabis to treat elderly patients will be placed Los Angeles area clinics. The company also plans to host  educational seminars for patients and medical professionals, and to develop software that will suggest the best cannabis products and doses to treat different conditions. 
The vision is big. But Blatt, a former investment banker, said it’s all aimed at helping seniors. 
“The medical world has focused so much on prolonging life,” he said. “We want to improve the quality of that life.”

24,24,CA,www.ocregister.com,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/07/05/marijuana-festivals-and-businesses-that-benefit-from-them-are-hurting-now-that-cannabis-is-legal-in-california/,"

			Marijuana festivals, and businesses that benefit from them, are hurting now that cannabis is legal in California		
","Marijuana festival organizers were banking on this to be their biggest year yet, now that recreational cannabis is legal in California and the state is legitimizing such events by licensing them for the first time. 
Promoters say they planned to stop operating under the loose protections of the state’s medical marijuana laws, where they’d force attendees to get doctor’s recommendations for cannabis before entering the gates. Instead, they hoped to have licenses that would allow anyone 21 and older to buy and smoke cannabis, just like they can buy and drink beer at other festivals. 
But with local authorities now able to block such festivals even from the limited venues where they’re permitted by new state rules, there weren’t any state-sanctioned events in Southern California during the first half of the year. And none are on the horizon for the rest of 2018. 
The picture is a bit brighter in Northern California. The state licensed marijuana festivals this spring in Sacramento and in Santa Rosa, where the massive Emerald Cup is also expected to go off in December without a hitch. 
“It’s costing us a lot of money, but it’s going to come back in the long run,” said Tim Blake, who founded The Emerald Cup festival and competition 15 years ago. “We’re going to really be teaching them how it should be done.” 
But with many of California’s largest marijuana festivals – such as the now-postponed Chalice California in Victorville – unable to secure permits to allow consumption and sales, overall attendance and revenue for promoters, vendors and fairground venues is expected to be down significantly in the first year of legalization. 
“We are taking a big hit,” said Franco Rodriguez, promoter of the High Life Music Festival, which got turned down for a marijuana sales permit by the city of San Bernardino. “Our own government is not letting the people do what we voted for.” 
People who own hotels, restaurants and other businesses near these venues are also expressing concern. They say the boost they’ve seen as tens of thousands of people have flocked to these events in the past has helped them sustain and grow their operations. 
A lawsuit over these festival rules is pending, while some organizers say they’re looking to move their events out of California. 
Other festival promoters are taking the same approach as the rest of California’s still-massive black market. They’re citing a “crippling” permit system, lingering legal gray areas and delayed enforcement as justification to keep hosting events that make it look as though nothing has changed when it comes to marijuana laws in California – even though, officially, everything has. 
Festivals that let people buy and smoke marijuana are now legally restricted to fairground venues authorized by the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
“There’s no other type of event to be limited to that,” Blake said. “It’s kind of ridiculous.” 
Several of the state’s 80 sanctioned fairs are defunct or share facilities. Others – such as Santa Maria Fairpark, home to the Santa Barbara County Fair – can’t host cannabis events under state law because they’re within 600 feet of schools. 
Carving out those properties leaves California with around 70 venues that can entertain the notion of permitting cannabis festivals. But the obstacles don’t end there. 
For 20 years, medical marijuana festivals in California only needed permission from whoever owned or managed the event venue. But as of Jan. 1, companies that want to host festivals where cannabis can be sold and consumed must first get annual licenses from the state. Then, for every event they host, they need permission from the board that oversees the venue, from the city or county where the venue is located and again from the state. 
Several fair boards, such as the ones that oversee OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa and Amador County Fairgrounds & Event Center near Sacramento, have opted to ban all cannabis-themed events. 
“We just don’t think it is a good fit for us here in Amador County,” said Troy Bowers, chief executive for the Northern California venue. 
The Department of Food Agriculture has recommended “that each fair board set local policy about cannabis events,” according to agency spokesman Steve Lyle. But managers for some facilities, including Tehama District Fairgrounds in Northern California, said they don’t have a policy because they haven’t yet been approached about holding marijuana events. Others say their city or county already prohibits all commercial cannabis activity, so they know festivals wouldn’t get local approval anyway. 
“We have to abide by local rules and regulations,” said Dan Jacobs, general manager of the Antelope Valley Fair & Event Center in Lancaster, which blocks marijuana sales. 
Only around 10 state-sanctioned fairground venues are in cities or counties that permit recreational marijuana sales, according to a database of local marijuana policies compiled by the Southern California News Group. 
In at least two of those 10 communities, either the fair board or local authorities have already opted to block cannabis events. That leaves perhaps eight viable venues for hosting marijuana festivals in all of California, with several in remote communities far from the state’s population centers. 
Getting turned down for marijuana consumption and sales permits is expected to mean a substantial drop in attendance, industry insiders say. 
Attendees called High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup, held in San Bernardino in April, a “ghost town” after the city refused to sign off on the event at the last minute. 
Chalice was slated to take place in Victorville from July 13-15, with shows by Ludacris and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on the ticket. But event producer Ryan Heil said he expected a 60 percent loss in revenue after the city said its ordinance bans cannabis sales at the event, which they said brought more than $33 million to the area last year. So on July 4, organizers announced they were postponing the event, with no word yet on when and where it will now take place. 
Rodriguez said he expects to make at least 50 percent less money than he’d hoped when High Life comes to National Orange Show Events Center in September, since he was forced to make it an all-ages show with no cannabis sales allowed. They’re still telling adults 21 and older that they can bring their own marijuana to consume in a “cannabis garden.” 
With fairgrounds in Humboldt County so far shutting them out, organizers of the Cannifest event are looking at potentially moving their operation to Pennsylvania or Ohio. 
Other festival organizers – including the team behind Re-Up Festival 2.0 at National Orange Show Events Center this weekend – appear to be carrying on just like they did in previous years. 
Re-Up Festival is promoting a “special 420 area” that will be open to anyone 18 and older with a doctor’s recommendation for medical marijuana. And they’re selling both “medicated” and “non-medicated” vendor packages, just as festival organizers did for years under California’s Proposition 215 medical marijuana law. 
“I think there are still events happening that feel they’re operating under Prop. 215 rules,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control. He said that’s why his agency in April issued a notice letting people know sales are only allowed at licensed festivals by licensed vendors. The notice also says collectives that do business at festivals could face civil penalties for “unlicensed commercial cannabis activity.” 
Chalice organizers in June filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Cannabis Control and the city of Victorville after both entities refused to issue permits for the festival. The suit claims that Victorville shouldn’t have authority over the state-owned fairgrounds. 
If Chalice wins the legal challenge, marijuana festivals could potentially take place at any of California’s 50 or so state-owned fairground venues even without approval from the local city or county. 
Southern California festival organizers are hoping they might soon find a new home at the Lake Perris Fairgrounds. Riverside County is floating an ordinance that would permit festivals in unincorporated areas. 
Assembly Bill 2020, proposed by Assemblyman Bill Quirk, D-Hayward, could also significantly increase the options by letting the state authorize cannabis events at any venue that has local approval. That would allow, say, the city of Los Angeles to permit marijuana-themed festivals even though there aren’t any fairgrounds in its boundaries. 
Los Angeles appears to be banking on some such change to state law. The City Council on Tuesday approved placing a marijuana tax measure on the Nov. 6 ballot that includes a $5 surcharge for tickets to temporary cannabis events.

			First tests are in, and 1 in 5 marijuana samples in California isn’t making grade		
","One in five batches of marijuana has failed laboratory testing since new state safety requirements kicked in July 1, according to data from the California Bureau of Cannabis Control. 
Failures have been triggered by inaccurate labeling or contamination from pesticides, bacteria or processing chemicals. 
Those testing requirements and results have left some retailers with severely limited inventory over the past few weeks, as cultivators and product manufacturers scramble to get compliant products to market. 
There was a big gap at the beginning of the month with the supply of marijuana buds in particular, according to Nick Rinella, chief operating officer of Verdant Distribution, a Long Beach-based independent cannabis distributor. 
The new testing requirements have also created backlogs at busy labs. 
The state has licensed just 31 testing labs, most located in Northern California, and many of them aren’t yet taking customers. As a result, Rinella said cannabis safety tests are taking between one and two weeks. 
And this week the first cannabis product was recalled from store shelves because it doesn’t meet new standards regarding pesticide levels. 
While that’s concerning, in the short term, industry experts believe it’s also a sign that California’s cannabis industry is maturing and starting to look like other regulated markets, such as alcohol and food. 
California launched legal recreational marijuana sales and imposed new rules for the cannabis industry on New Years Day. But state regulators gave businesses a six-month grace period to comply with some rules, including a requirement that they could only sell products that had been tested for safety by a licensed lab. 
That grace period ended July 1, and the state says since then labs have tested 5,268 batches of marijuana, about 20 percent of which failed to meet state standards.

Those numbers would likely be higher if companies weren’t paying for independent lab tests before putting their products through the official supply chain, according to Verdant Distribution founder Brian Blatz. 
“Smart brands are pretesting first, then testing again in the labs,” he said. 
More than two thirds (68 percent) of the cannabis batches that failed in state tests did so because of inaccurate claims on the labels. Specifically, labels often over-state the amount of THC — the compound in cannabis that makes people feel high — that’s actually in the cannabis, according to Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso. 
While that’s not necessarily a safety hazard, it can lead consumers to overpay for products that aren’t as strong as advertised. 
Nearly one in five of the failed tests (19 percent) were related to pesticides. In some cases, the cannabis tested for traces of pesticides that are totally forbidden; in others, it tested with higher levels of pesticides than the amount deemed safe by state law. 
Los Angeles-based company The Bloom Brand announced Wednesday it was recalling four vaporizer cartridges with cannabis oil that doesn’t meet state standards for safe levels of the pesticide Myclobutanil.The fungicide is commonly used on food crops, such as grapes and almonds, but is believed to be unsafe when heated — a process that’s common for marijuana smokers. 
The Bloom Brand cartridges were sold to 100 stores throughout the state between July 1-19. It’s not yet clear how the products got to market after July 1 with unsafe levels of Myclobutanil. 
“We are working closely with (state cannabis officials) to remedy this issue and expect clean, compliant products to be back on shelves in three weeks,” the company said in a press release. 
Some marijuana is testing positive for pesticides that cultivators never used, according to Micah Anderson, president of the Southern California Responsible Growers Council, a cannabis trade group. He said product from several growers who’ve taken over former vineyards, for example, failed initial tests because the soil was contaminated, with stricter limits on pesticides allowed in marijuana than in wine. 
“For growers, this will definitively be the biggest challenge they face,” said Cliff Yeh, co-founder of Encore Labs, a cannabis testing center in Pasadena. 
There are 60-plus banned or regulated pesticides. Growers can pass the majority of the limits on the pesticide guidelines, Yeh said, but if they fail on a few the whole batch is considered a failure. 
Around 6 percent of lab test failures since July 1 have been due to microbial impurities, such as mold and bacteria. The most common microbes showing up are the fungus aspergillus and the bacteria e.coli and salmonella, all of which can develop in marijuana if it isn’t properly stored with careful controls for humidity. 
Another 5 percent of failed marijuana samples have involved concentrated waxes and oils that tested positive for residual solvents, such as ethanol, butane and isopropanol. Those chemicals are used to extract THC and other active ingredients from marijuana plants. 
Some additional marijuana testing requirements will be phased in Dec. 31. 
Starting in 2019, all marijuana products will need to be tested for heavy metals and mycotoxins, toxic substances that can come from mold. Products will also need to be tested for levels of terpenoids, the organic chemicals that give marijuana its distinct aroma and play a role in its effects. And marijuana-infused edibles will have to be tested for moisture content, to make sure they’re not breeding grounds for bacteria and mold. 
And more as yet unspecified adjustments are expected, with the state still crafting permanent industry regulations. But just three weeks after the latest testing requirements took affect, Rinella said shelves at marijuana shops are starting to fill back up with product deemed safe for consumers. 
Profit margins for most licensed cannabis companies remain thin as they struggle to make it through turbulence that comes when a gray market is fully legalized, Blatz said. But the producers that do survive are competing to see who will be the first Anheuser-Busch of cannabis. 
“Because the market is still maturing, there’s not really brand loyalty yet,” he said. “But it’s coming.”

			La Palma City Council drops idea of allowing some marijuana-related businesses		
","La Palma might be small, but its citizens were loud and clear Tuesday night: They don’t want their city to become what one resident described as “the pot capital of northwest Orange County.” 
Citizens overflowed the City Council Chambers, some having to sit in an adjoining room, to oppose changing city laws to allow some cannabis-related businesses. Many residents learned of the meeting from flyers left on their doorsteps, calling them to the meeting to voice their opinions. 
Council members said they heard the residents’ opinions and agreed to not pursue changes to La Palma’s current ban on the commercial cultivation, warehousing, delivery, testing and sale of marijuana in town. 
If the city later needs a new source of revenue the conversation could be revisited, Mayor Gerard Goedhart said at the end of the meeting, but it is off the table for now. Council members were clear they weren’t interested in dispensaries. 
“The public paid me to teach kids to say no to drugs. I can see a teacher in 2019 trying to teach kids to say no to drugs and a kid says, ‘Well, wait. La Palma makes drugs,’” Jeanne Culver, a resident and long-time teacher, said. “What kind of message are we telling our children?” 
Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and La Habra are the only Orange County cities to allow any marijuana-related businesses, Santa Ana is the only allowing dispensaries. 
Residents also asked the City Council that if the issue comes back up to put the decision to voters on a ballot, instead of having the elected leaders make the call. 
“Why would you do something that runs against the people of La Palma?” Carlos Alcaino asked council members, referencing the 57 percent of La Palma voters who opposed Proposition 64. “We said in 2016 that we didn’t want it.” 
City Manager Laurie Murray said the discussion came about as a “business decision” to diversify city revenues and protect La Palma’s financial stability in the event another major tax provider leaves the city. La Palma residents approved a 1 cent sales tax increase after facing a $772,000 budget deficit in 2016. Estimates were marijuana-related businesses could net the city “anywhere from $500,000 to 1.2 million” annually in revenue. 
Murray added staff members also broached the question because there seemed to be a “paradigm shift” in opinion regarding cannabis, referencing the recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a cannabis-based drug treatment for epilepsy and recommendations to the Drug Enforcement Agency to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug in response. 
“Right now, we’re not ready,” Goedhart said. “The controversy isn’t something we need right now.”

28,28,CA,www.sfgate.com,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marijuana-addiction-is-real-and-rising-13021615.php,"Marijuana addiction is real, and rising","For as long as most residents can remember, smoking marijuana has been a part of life here. The fact that California legalized the practice in January went practically unnoticed in this quiet town a half-hour's drive north of San Francisco, where some say the normalization of America's marijuana culture got its start. 
For Quintin Pohl and other teenagers before him, smoking pot was a rite of passage. It was a diversion from the loneliness he felt at home when his parents were splitting up and a salve for middle-school angst. It was his entire social life in seventh and eighth grades, he said, when social life is everything. 
Even though nearly all his friends were using marijuana and seeming to enjoy it, Pohl said, at some point his marijuana use took a turn he never saw coming: He became addicted. 
Many people are unaware of marijuana addiction. But in the public health and medical communities, it is a well-defined disorder that includes physical withdrawal symptoms, cravings and psychological dependence. Many say it is on the rise, perhaps because of the increasing potency of genetically engineered plants and the use of concentrated products, or because more users are partaking multiple times a day. 
""There should be no controversy about the existence of marijuana addiction,"" said David Smith, a physician who has been treating addiction since he opened a free clinic in San Francisco's drug-drenched Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the 1960s. ""We see it every day. The controversy should be why it appears to be affecting more people."" 
Although estimates of the number of people who use marijuana vary, the federal government and the marijuana industry tend to agree that total marijuana use has remained relatively constant over the past decade. Increased use in the past three years has been slight, despite increased commercial availability in states that have legalized it. 
The percentage of people who become addicted to marijuana - estimated at about 9 percent of all users, and about 17 percent of those who start in adolescence - also has been stable. Some studies report that even higher proportions of marijuana users develop a dependence, which means they experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the drug. 
Yet here in Northern California, some addiction treatment practitioners say they're seeing a surge in demand for help, particularly among adolescents. 
Marijuana's estimated rate of addiction is lower than that of cocaine and alcohol (15 percent) and heroin (24 percent). Unlike with opioids and stimulants, marijuana dependence tends to develop slowly: Months or years may pass before symptoms begin to affect a dependent user's life. 
There are no known reports of anyone dying of a marijuana overdose or of the drug's common withdrawal symptoms: chills, sweats, cravings, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, anxiety and irritability. 
According to Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, an estimated 2.7 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for marijuana dependence, second only to alcohol dependence. 
Smith, a visiting physician at Muir Wood Adolescent and Family Services, a treatment center for boys where Pohl eventually got help, speculates that the potency of today's pot is causing a higher prevalence of problematic marijuana use. 
""Back in the day when kids were sitting around smoking a joint, the THC levels found in marijuana averaged from 2 to 4 percent,"" Smith said. ""That's what most parents think is going on today. And that's why society thinks marijuana is harmless."" 
But selective breeding has resulted in an average potency of 20 percent THC, the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana. Some strains exceed 30 percent. 
Marijuana concentrates and extracts, much more commonly used in the past five years, have THC levels that range from 40 percent to more than 80 percent, according to marijuana industry promotional information and Drug Enforcement Administration reports. 
Susan Weiss, who directs research on the health effects of marijuana at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, told a group of addiction doctors at the annual meeting of the American Society of Addiction Medicine in April that the federal government is trying to get the message out that marijuana can be addictive. 
""But believe it or not,"" she told the group, ""we're having a hard time convincing people that addiction exists."" 
The National Cannabis Industry Association's chief spokesman, Morgan Fox, said he's not surprised the federal government is having a hard time convincing the public that marijuana can be addictive. 
""It's their own fault,"" he said of the government. ""When people find out they've been lied to by the federal government about the relative harms of marijuana for decades, they are much less likely to believe anything they have to say going forward, even if that information is accurate."" 
Fox said his organization has no disagreement with the finding that about 9 percent of people who use marijuana become addicted, and his organization urges its members to make that clear in their marketing information. But he disagrees that more-potent forms of marijuana may be causing an increase in addiction. ""It just means people need to consume less to achieve the desired effect,"" he said. 
So far, no scientific studies have shown that stronger pot increases the likelihood of addiction, and large swaths of the general public continue to question the existence of marijuana addiction. But for Quintin Pohl, addiction was real. 
Pohl said his marijuana addiction took years to develop. His mother, Kimberly Thomas, said that once she realized her son was using marijuana frequently, ""it was like a roller coaster chugging uphill, chugging, chugging, chugging. You know something is happening,"" she said, ""and then just within a couple of days, you reach the peak and zoom downhill. It was awful, awful."" 
Scott Sowle, executive director of the Muir Wood rehabilitation center, said he gets the same call from parents nearly every day. 
""They call and say, 'My 16-year-old son was doing really well in school. He was interested in sports and involved in extracurricular activities. But suddenly, he's just not the same kid anymore.' "" 
Pohl recalled that he drank a little, off and on, but that marijuana was his constant obsession. After middle school, he got involved in rowing for a couple of years and took a break from his group of marijuana friends. But after he decided competitive rowing wasn't for him, Pohl said he started smoking pot again, this time with new friends who smoked all the time. 
And then the roller coaster plunged. 
His grades plummeted. He stopped going home most of the time and was couch surfing for a while. Finally, he said, his mom called the police on him for stealing her car. ""At that point, I was heartless, emotionless,"" he said. ""I was just kind of a blob taking up space. I was baked 24/7."" 
Pohl's mother said she saw that he was in trouble and demanded that he stay at home every moment he wasn't in school. (Pohl's father was living in San Francisco.) 
""She told me to come back home. So I did,"" Pohl said. ""At the time, I wasn't sure why she did that. I was still in that whole miserable phase, smoking at least an ounce of weed a week - two ounces on a good week."" (One ounce is enough to smoke four to eight joints every day for a week, depending on their size.) 
Then early one morning before school, Pohl recalled, two private investigators his mother had hired appeared and took him to Muir Wood. 
Pohl said he went through a week of pure misery at the rehab center: angry, in denial and suffering. ""I couldn't sleep for a week. I was cold, and then I was sweating. I hated everything,"" he said. ""And then the sun hit my face one morning, and it felt great. Things tasted good, smelled better, everything was just enhanced."" 
During his six weeks there, Pohl took intensive classes with about 10 other boys and talked to his therapist frequently. His mother spent eight hours a week there, attending parent classes, sharing meals with her son and working with him and his therapist to address the underlying issues that had led him to self-medicate with marijuana. 
Pohl says he hasn't smoked marijuana since he left Muir Wood last July. For the rest of the summer and after school in the fall, he attended classes at a Muir Wood outpatient clinic in San Rafael. 
Wearing black pants, a black sweatshirt and a pink skull cap on a cool but sunny day in late May, Pohl smiles broadly when he talks about his future. After his June graduation, he says, he plans to start working full time at the grocery store where he's had a part-time job for the last year. 
He's thinks he can start smoking marijuana again some day - socially, when he's an adult.

A crowd gathers at Golden Gate Park during the annual 4/20 celebration on Hippie Hill. 
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to clock out and spark up for the global cannabis holiday today known as 4/20. That includes about 15,000 in Golden Gate Park's Robin Williams Meadow, the site of so-called Hippie Hill and the second annual licensed 4/20 gathering. 
The term ""420"" has evolved from a code for ""time to toke up"" among Northern California high school students in the late 1970s, to a marijuana subcultural meme, to a global rallying cry for cannabis-user liberation. 
We talked to 10 noted growers, activists, retailers, and experts about 420's meaning to them on the eve of the first 4/20 with commercial legalization in California. 
1)  Has 420 lost its meaning now that cannabis is legal? 
""NO. After all, it's still illegal to smoke pot in [Golden Gate] Park."" — Dale Gieringer, director, California NORML. 
""No! It is only further legitimized. My wife sent me an email blast earlier today from a mainstream online clothing retailer who is doing 20% off their entire site on 4/20. I think it's great that we dedicate at least one day a year to globally celebrate this amazing plant. We cannabis users deserve a national holiday and now we have it!"" — Aaron Justis, President, Buds & Roses. 
""Not at all. ... We just need more public venues to party in style. That will require a change of the regulations, but we will get there."" — Mikki Norris, East Bay activist. 
""For the longest time, nobody knew what the mysterious 420 stood for anyway ... until High Times revealed its secret. Then, after Senate Bill 420 was enacted, the number became enshrined in the broader vernacular. So I don't think it's lost its significance at all."" — Chris Conrad, East Bay activist. 
""Absolutely not! It will only get more popular - I expect Hallmark will have 420 greeting cards soon."" — Nikki Lastreto, Swami Select Farms. 
""Hell no, it's just becoming the St. Patrick's Day of weed, but greener and safer."" — Jane West, CEO of the Jane West cannabis lifestyle brand. 
""Absolutely not. Adult sales will offer an entrance to the Willy Wonka Factory (cannabis retailers) for an entirely new segment, that were not medical patients or refused to identify as."" — Keith Stephenson, Purple Heart Patient Center. 
""In fact, you can think about 4/20 like the Super Bowl (or Mardi Gras) of cannabis."" — Jamie Warm, CEO, Henry's Original. 
On April, 20, at 4:20 p.m., many San Franciscans will be celebrating the holiday ""420."" But what does 420 mean? Where does the expression come from? We have the real story. 
2) Is the significance of the ""holiday"" enhanced or diminished by the fact that the code word for something that was once taboo is no longer taboo and how basically any secrecy has long since passed in the era where huge crowds show up to Hippie Hill? 
""Cannabis is only legal in eight states so far, with limited medical exemptions in another 21, so 420 may have lost its significance as far as being a 'secret' code but, to the extent that cannabis consumers federally and in most states still need a secret code to illegally share this pastime, the taboo is real."" — Conrad 
""It's true that the subversive aspect of the 420 code is long gone. It's no longer being used to quietly signal 'it's time to sneak away to smoke pot' anymore, unless maybe you are in the midwest in a room full of senior citizens. Instead, it has morphed into a day of celebration, where we get together to proudly celebrate the fact that prohibition is finally ending. ... 420 forever!"" — Debbie Goldsberry, operator, Magnolia Wellness 
""It's enhanced as more people are looking forward to this epic day. There's still sworn secrecy, as casual consumers do not always want everyone to know their personal business."" — Stephenson 
""Is cannabis 'no longer taboo'? Depends on who you're talking too, even though we have made huge steps forward, it amazes me that some people still live in the dark ages."" — Mario Sherbinski, founder of Sherbinskis cannabis 
""With legalization and lower dosed products, I think 4/20 has moved away from being a holiday to being more of a lifestyle or integration into every day life. I think every day is now 4/20."" — Clement Kwan, co-founder of Beboe 
""The vast majority of the world still cannot consume this plant and thousands are still locked up because of it. The hippie's can't stop yet, as Jack Herer once told me, and many others, 'We cannot stop until ALL POT PRISONERS ARE SET FREE!!'"" — Justis 
""It remains taboo for millions of workers and people on government jobs."" — Gieringer 
""Legalization brings new consumers, so I would say enhanced. Our industry is growing so rapidly. More people learn about 420 every day, and it means something different to each person, depending on their age, where they grew up, and how important cannabis is to them."" — 'Hitman Dougie' Dracup, Hitman Glass 
""Let us not forget that cannabis is still federally illegal, mothers cannot safely give their kids CBD oil and many counties have placed bans on cannabis cultivation and sales. The fight has only just begun."" — Madrone Stewart, author of Feminist Weed Farmer: Growing Mindful Medicine in Your Own Back Yard 
""The stigma is not gone yet, but we are working on it though education. We live in a bubble in California, especially up here in Mendocino, but if this were Louisiana ..."" — Lastreto. 
""I wouldn't say that it's enhanced or diminished. I think we went beyond that long before cannabis was legal this year."" — Daniel Stein, EVB, Oakland 
""It may have lost its secrecy but there's a lot to celebrate with the end of prohibition."" — West 
3) Is 420 still used as a code word at all? 
""Absolutely."" — Gieringer 
""Not really. I remember when my kids first 'discovered' 420 in middle school (probably from a Seth Rogen movie). They thought they were on to something that their parents didn't know about. Little did they know..."" — Stein 
""It's morphed from code word to symbol. 420 means freedom. You say it and cheer."" — Goldsberry 
""Just to refer to 'weed stuff,' as far as I can tell."" — West 
""Amongst our circles, we don't hear people using that as a code word at all anymore. I think with the many lower dosage products, it's no longer an event or ritual to consume as its incorporated so seamlessly into every day life."" — Kwan 
""I don't think it's used as a code word as much as an excuse to smoke herb, because it's 420, haha!"" — Sherbinski 
""YES, it's still code for 'want to get high?'. Being legal just means more people will use it and know what it means!"" — Lastreto 
""Yes. People in Humboldt use 420 to advertise properties that are set up for cannabis cultivation."" — Stewart 
""Yes. We always notice when it's 4:20 and start thinking it's time to light one up. When an ad or someone says something is '420-friendly,' it means that people allow or are open to cannabis use."" — Norris 
""I don't personally use it, but people use it regularly."" — Dracup 
4) How will you observe 4/20? 
""It's my birthday. I celebrate by taking a vacation from all MJ business."" — Gieringer 
""I'll probably stay home on my boat and relax. I don't like crowds."" — Stewart 
""I will be attending a 40 0z. Van party in LA."" — Sherbinski 
""We'll treat it like your average Friday. We as a brand have found that Mother's Day and the week leading up to it has really been our ""4/20"". — Kwan 
""Smoking out at Earth Day with my lovely wife, Mikki Norris."" — Conrad 
""We are throwing a big party to celebrate 4/20 at Magnolia Wellness, with a marijuana farmers market, music, and vape samples in our consumption lounge. We are also auditioning for Shark Tank that morning. That is going to be so fun!"" — Goldsberry 
5) How should 4/20 (4:20) be observed? 
""The best way to observe 4/20 is to be with lots of other cannabis consumers, sharing a joint or sacrament, listening to music, dancing, having great conversations, or enjoying some food — all the things cannabis enhances for us. It's up to you about the daily observance of 4:20. Sometimes, when you still have a lot of work to do, it may be better to light up at 6:20 or 8:40 (two 420s). But, if you are done with your responsibilities, then observing 4:20 by smoking cannabis and taking a nice walk to enjoy nature is a wonderful thing to do."" — Norris 
""Daily!"" — Stewart Stinson, general manager of TheWEED. 
""Of course! We also like to honor 2:15 (in honor of Proposition 215) — and you could consider Proposition 64 to be 4 minutes after every hour ... in other words, it is always time for 4:20! — Lastreto 
""It should be celebrated in every time zone, so you can smoke cannabis with people all around the world. It's 4:20 somewhere, at least 48 times a day."" — Goldsberry 
""To be proper, in the wee hours of the morning."" — Gieringer 
""4:20 kicks off the end of my work day. I like to call it 'flower hour,' and I use cannabis to unwind and clear my head of business and busy-ness. This isn't meant to be 'cute.' For real: happy hour is a culturally accepted daily routine where people consume intoxicants in bars and restaurants. How is sparking up at 4:20 at the end of a long workday any different?"" — West 
""Responsibly, in moderation and within the confines of an approved space."" — Stephenson 
""420 is one of those magical things that can take the shape of a time, date, dollar amount, address, etc. Every time I see it pop up, it makes me stop and smile. Maybe that is how it should be observed.""  — Stein 
""I like to observe 4:20 when I can. The magic of 4:20 is to light up at the same time you know that thousands of other people are doing exactly the same thing. It creates a virtual community — we don't have to see or hear or even know each other but we know that we all share this moment with cannabis and honor it with high honor. That feels pretty good."" — Conrad 
""For all that care to unite and light, 420 is still and always will be our time!  — Sherbinski"

Six months after marijuana was legalized, new safety and regulation laws take effect Sunday, and some Sacramento dispensaries are rushing to clear inventory that will no longer be salable come Sunday, July 1. 
The deadline marks the end of a six-month transition window before new labeling, packaging and product testing requirements take hold. 
Starting Sunday, products must pass additional checks for pesticides, chemicals and foreign material, according to the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. Dispensaries are required to destroy any marijuana goods out of compliance starting Sunday.

Employees at A Therapeutic Alternative in Sacramento said that 60 percent of their inventory is on clearance until the end of the month and will be pulled from shelves July 1, due to the changes in product regulations and licensing of their suppliers. 
Staff had a positive spin on the retail crunch and urged potential buyers to make the most of the window, saying that products are discounted down to prices that they don’t plan to offer in the future. 
Following strict advertising and communications laws, A Therapeutic Alternative could only publicize their menu featuring sale products and prices inside the dispensary, on their website and on sites for visitors 21 and older. 
In July, A Therapeutic Alternative executive director Kimberly Cargile said that the dispensary's selection will thin out as noncompliant products get taken off the shelf, but Cargile expects many of her suppliers to be back in business once they’ve caught up with testing and packaging requirements. 
On Saturday, A Therapeutic Alternative will give away any remaining clearance products to anyone with a state-issued medical marijuana ID card. 
On Sunday, all remaining noncompliant inventory will be turned over to cannabis waste hauling services. The unsellable marijuana products will be quarantined for 72 hours, mixed with shredded paper and water and sent to a landfill. 
Despite losing inventory, Cargile said she is a strong proponent of the regulations. 
“These regulations are very necessary for consumer protections, environmental protection and public safety protections, so they are good and we support them,” said Cargile. 
“However it's more difficult to operate within a regulated market and more difficult than we anticipated.”

33,33,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article214224109.html,Is your favorite dispensary out of marijuana? Blame this new state regulation | The Sacramento Bee,"A newly-enacted state ordinance regulating cannabis products has forced multiple area dispensaries to close while others make do with a limited selection. 
Sunday marked the end of California dispensaries' grace period before new restrictions on THC limits, packaging and labeling took effect. The state Bureau of Cannabis Control mandated the destruction of all improperly labeled or overly strong products by July 1, leading to steep clearance sales at the end of June as up to $500 million worth of marijuana was predicted to be destroyed statewide. 
The new regulations were approved as part of recreational marijuana's statewide legalization in November 2016 under Proposition 64, and required cannabis products to first be tested at state-certified labs starting on July 1 of this year before they can be sold. Such labs can be hard to find and are in high demand, said Shayna Schonauer, the Sacramento regional manager for Metro Cannabis Co. 
While Metro Cannabis Co. has a good amount of marijuana buds available, edibles and concentrate have been harder to come by. That won't change anytime soon, she said. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
""We're doing the best we can, but we're basically at the state's mercy in terms of being compliant,"" Schonauer said. ""It's going to be a little while before you see that rush of product."" 
At Valley Health Options, ordinarily open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. near the intersection of Auburn Boulevard and El Camino Avenue, two security guards turned customers away on Monday afternoon and said the store would be closed through the end of the week. A guard confirmed the closure was related to the new regulation and said Valley Health's owner had been in and out of the building throughout the morning. 
Turlock-based Dry Lake Wellness was also closed Monday despite normally being open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., though Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso said they were an unlicensed dispensary. Other dispensaries such as A Therapeutic Alternative gave their non-compliant substances away free to customers Saturday to avoid handing them over the next day to specialty waste hauling services that would lock buds and pre-rolled joints in compost bins and deposit crushed cartridges in landfills. 
A California Cannabis Industry Association spokesman told Wired he expected four tons of marijuana to be destroyed in the Sacramento area alone. Steep discounts led to record sales on June 29 and June 30 at Green Solutions, manager Justin Robertson said, as dispensaries attempted to make some money back on their inventory. 
Green Solutions previously ordered bulk shipments of buds from distributors and packaged them into various weights down to individual grams in a back room. Distributors now have to do the final packaging under the new regulations, Robertson said, and Green Solutions hasn't found one willing to spend the time and money on shipping small quantities of weed. 
Prices have risen at Robertson's store due to having an ""enforced middleman"" making child-proof containers instead of the typical mylar bags he bought and filled in the back, and about one in five customers came in looking for their usual items Monday only to find them unavailable. Some forms of cannabis were especially hard to come by: Green Solutions had just one type of concentrate in stock instead of the usual 15. 
Still, Robertson wasn't convinced the extra oversight would ultimately be bad for business. It's better to have top-grade product in the long run, he said, even if the initial transition is rocky for low-budget customers. 
""(People are) guaranteed to get a certain product now, compared to before when the quality could vary,"" he said. ""(The change is) bad for people's wallets, but good for their lungs.""

34,34,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article211779349.html,Pot businesses are on a hiring spree. Here’s how much the jobs pay | The Sacramento Bee,"Eight years ago, Samantha Miller was earning six figures a year as a product developer for a LED lighting company in Northern California when a high school friend called to ask a favor. Would Miller be able to help her friend's boss at a medical marijuana dispensary figure out how to use a new machine purchased to analyze the quality of pot? 
Miller passed on the job, but offered some free advice. With her background in machinery design and lab supervision, she told the dispensary folks: ""You need (to hire) a scientist because you are going to ruin that piece of equipment if you don’t know how to run it."" 
The dispensary owner ignored her warning and sure enough, Miller soon received a call that the machine had gone kaput. Fed up, the owner offered to give the high-tech device to Miller if she could repair it — and would be willing to test the dispensary's marijuana for free. 
Miller fixed the machine, and her business was born. ""I look back at the moment, and I don't know what totally seized me,"" she said. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
These days, Miller employs about 10 people at Pure Analytics, a quality assurance and testing company outside of Santa Rosa. Last month, she hired four people, including two high-level scientists. (One's an expert with terpene, a component of marijuana that gives it its aroma.) Both are types of jobs that can earn six-figures, Miller said. 
She also hired field sample technicians — employees who go to customer facilities and collect product to bring back to the lab. The job requires workers to have a Bachelor of Science degree, she said, and employees in those kinds of positions can earn between $40,000 and $55,000 annually, depending on ""how many years out of school and how wet they are behind the ears."" 
Samantha Miller, owner and chief scientist at Santa Rosa-based Pure Analytics, talks about the boom in the marijuana testing industry and the future of education and the job market in the industry in May 2018. 
More than a year and a half has passed since Californians legalized the adult use of recreational marijuana, and since then, pot has become one fastest growing employment sectors in the U.S. Job creation isn't limited to dirt-under-the-fingernails positions like growers and trimmers. White collar work in the industry also is exploding, with businesses scrambling to hire scientists, attorneys, accountants, technicians and marketing experts. 
Employment sites such as Monster.com and Indeed.com are filled with openings. A medical marijuana dispensary in Sacramento needs an experienced store manager. Salary: $40,000-$60,000. A cannabis lab in Los Angeles wants to process manager-lab technician and will pay $75,000-$110,000. CEOs and master growers also can command six-figure salaries — and equity in the company. 
California leads the nation in marijuana employment. In 2017, the state had 38,233 people directly employed in the pot business, and 18,165 people in related employment, according to BDS Analytics, a market research firm that follows the industry. By 2021, BDS predicts that almost 100,000 Californians will be employed in the cannabis industry. 
Similar gains are expected nationally well. With recreational or medical marijuana legal in 29 states and the nation’s capital, the pot industry employed 121,000 people in the U.S. last year. By 2021, that’s predicted to more than double, according to BDS. 
Those looking for cannabis jobs already can feel the momentum. According to employment site ZipRecruiter.com, marijuana job postings increased 693 percent from the last quarter of 2016 to last quarter 2017. 
California, Colorado and Washington had the highest number of marijuana jobs posted last year, according to the site. 
The allure of the industry is about more than the abundance of positions or the amounts they pay. Similar to those who signed up to work at Silicon Valley start ups, many marijuana employees were drawn by the opportunity to work in a nascent industry and help create companies from the ground up. This applies to millennials as well as mid-career professionals looking for a change. 
“There may be some people who are getting nice salaries, but the majority of reasons we are seeing people from other industries come over is because ... it’s exciting,” said Lara Kaminsky, executive director of the Cannabis Alliance, a Seattle-based trade association. “It’s uncharted territory. They can apply skills they developed in other industries and be more creative. This is an opportunity to really shift the landscape to what a new industry looks like.” 
There's also the hope of being a part of the ""green rush,"" and possibly landing ""a little piece of the action"" in the form of stock options that one day could be worth millions, said Hugh Hempel, CEO of Strainz, a cannabis brand-management company that is one of the few weed businesses operating in multiple states (Washington, Colorado, Nevada and California). 
For some in the industry, job creation is a sign the marijuana business is maturing. 
Dr. Bao Le got into the medical marijuana business about eight years ago after his son was diagnosed with autism. The boy had night terrors, and Le wanted to avoid giving him traditional pharmaceuticals and began researching cannabis oils, he said. 
He realized there was a need in the market for ingredients that were quality-assured and pure. That led to the launch of his own company, BAS Research, a cannabis research and manufacturing company in Berkeley. 
Le said that with the mainstreaming of the marijuana marketplace, pot companies increasingly are relying on employees with the same job skills and talents as those in other industries. “You have got to have a full spectrum of professional people to take it from procurement to extraction to production and then go sell it,” he said. 
And people want in. “Within minutes” of posting a job, Le said, his company is flooded with responses. “We probably have 1,200 resumes right now for five positions,” he said. 
Hempel, an early employee at Netscape, said he got into the cannabis business seeking a treatment for his two twin teenage girls, who have Niemann-Pick Type C, a rare genetic disorder with no known cure. 
He said that while the job market in cannabis is hot right now, it’s just beginning to see recruiters headhunting for candidates with the same frequency as they do in other industries. Until a few years ago, his main way of finding talent was word-of-mouth or informal job boards such as Craigslist. Recently, a recruiter contacted him on LinkedIn to see if he was looking for a new opportunity. 
“It took me a little by surprise,” Hempel said. “It’s not the norm in this industry.” 
The idea of switching to the pot business from her job as an account manager at marketing agency for web development initially gave Heather Smyth pause. “I had concerns about having cannabis on my resume,” she said. 
But her worries evaporated as she realized that the cannabis business is just like any other business, she said. She’s now director of marketing at Wurk, a management consulting firm for the cannabis industry in Denver. 
“It’s a professional office space, and I’m doing a lot of the same things I’d be doing at any other marketing firm,” Smyth said. “ It’s fun.” 
Despite its growth, the pot industry faces challenges. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. The government considers it a Schedule 1 drug, one that has no accepted medical use and can be subject to abuse. That complicates the industry’s ability to use banks. It also means higher taxes because business owners can’t take advantage of federal tax deductions available to other businesses. It’s also hard for job candidates from overseas to get work visas. 
Meanwhile, California's marijuana tax revenues are off to a slow start. The state had expected to collect upwards of $175 million by mid-year, but only collected $34 million in the first quarter of 2018. That's in part because fewer communities than expected have welcomed the marijuana trade. Sales have been down as well, as some buyers, put off by high state and local taxes, opted for the black market. 
On the upside, a Gallup poll last fall found that two-thirds of the country supports legalization, including 51 percent of Republican respondents, a jump of 9 percentage points over last year. That represents a long, strange trip from the days of illicit nickel bags, fringed jackets and light shows. 
“It’s definitely a sea change,” said Lindsay Robinson, executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group. “It’s taken activists many, many years to get here. It’s really exciting to see politicians become outspoken. We’re hopeful that federal government will catch up to the will of the people.”

35,35,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/article213818444.html,Marijuana guard dogs strain animal shelter as illegal pot grows rise in Sacramento | The Sacramento Bee,"The canine soldiers in Sacramento's booming marijuana wars snarl and yap inside their kennels at the Front Street Animal Shelter. 
They are ""guard dogs,"" seized from illegal pot operations, and they are filling up the already overburdened shelter. 
Within the past week, at least 10 dogs guarding properties that police have identified as marijuana ""grow houses"" have been transferred to Front Street. Eight are German shepherds or shepherd mixes, which authorities said seem to be a favored breed among illegal pot growers. 
This year, the city began collecting data on dogs brought to the shelter from suspected unlicensed pot houses, said chief animal control officer Jace Huggins. During the first six months, animal control officers have picked up about 70 dogs that police said were tied to those operations, he said. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
""Unfortunately, it's almost a weekly occurrence for us these days,"" Huggins said. 
Although the city has no comparative figures, ""I really do think we're seeing more than we have in the past,"" he said. Huggins speculated that California's legalization of recreational and medical marijuana may have emboldened criminals to launch illegal residential grow houses in an effort to ""make some easy money."" 
Illegal grow house operators use large, strong dogs to protect their wares, Huggins said. The animals are not treated as pets. 
""Most of these houses are not lived in,"" he said. ""The product is grown in them, and the dogs are used as security. They live outside and get the bare minimum of food and water, and they usually are not socialized. They can be very aggressive."" 
Staffers at Front Street evaluate each of the animals for behavioral issues and their potential for adoption success, said shelter manager Gina Knepp. 
""Some of them are beautiful animals and good dogs,"" she said. But because of their backgrounds and temperaments, they may never make it out of the shelter alive. 
Janna Haynes, a spokeswoman for the county's Bradshaw Animal Shelter, said that facility receives far fewer guard dogs from criminal pot operations than the city is reporting. 
""Occasionally we get dogs in here associated with a drug situation,"" she said. ""We did get three this past weekend. 
""However, we've found the majority of these dogs to be somewhat sociable and good candidates for our behavior rehab program,"" she said. ""We have a lot of dogs that come in less than perfectly adoptable that emerge as great pets after some work."" 
Last week, the city shelter, already jammed with an overabundance of homeless dogs and cats, took charge of seven large canines that police said were guarding marijuana houses in south Sacramento. 
The Sacramento Police Department served search warrants on two homes in the area, neither of which appeared to be occupied, said spokesman Sgt. Vance Chandler. Four German shepherds were guarding one of the houses. At the other, a Mastiff and two mixed breed dogs patrolled the property. 
Because the city shelter was at capacity, animal control officers left the dogs at the homes and visited them daily to make sure they were properly fed and watered, said Huggins. They since have been transferred to Front Street. Authorities seized three more shepherds in similar circumstances on Tuesday. 
Despite the shelter's efforts, no one has come forward to claim the dogs. No arrests have been made in the cases, said Chandler. 
On Tuesday afternoon, the ""guard dogs"" and many others awaited their fate at Front Street. At least 14 German shepherds were scattered among the pit bull terriers, chihuahuas and others that occupied row after row of kennels, barking and gazing at visitors. 
Shepherds now are among the most common breed of dog that winds up at the shelter, said Knepp. During the first six months of 2017, the shelter took in 229 of the dogs. Through June 23 of this year, 331 had been impounded. 
""Certainly, I won't attribute all of it to marijuana grow houses,"" she said. ""But one has to wonder how much of that might be true."" 
Sacramento County animal control officer Mechelle Crites said that facility’s population of German shepherds also has soared recently. 
""Our intake of shepherds definitely is higher in the last year or so,” she said. “I can’t say why that is the case. “It’s kind of like a wave. We had the pit bull wave. Now it’s a shepherd wave. 
""It could be word of mouth that they make better guard dogs than pit bulls. Pit bulls can be unreliable as guard dogs. They can be real sissies."" 
German shepherds are widely coveted as ""protection animals"" because of their intelligence and strength, according to animal experts. The booming marijuana trade has spawned businesses that train shepherds specifically as ""cannabis security dogs."" 
""We understand the unique security needs surrounding the cannabis industry, and work closely with our clientele to provide them protection dogs that fit those needs,"" reads an online advertisement for one company, Forged K9, which features pictures of shepherds. ""From protecting a large cannabis grow operation to transporting produce or dispensary security, our dogs become your eyes and ears, as well as a trusted and beloved member of your family."" 
It is highly doubtful that the ""pot dogs"" now lingering at Front Street were viewed as family, said Huggins. 
""Unfortunately, most of them just are not very people friendly because of the lives that they've led,"" he said. ""Through no fault of their own, many of them just are not capable of being pets.""

Now, he’s facing life in prison | The Sacramento Bee","A resident of Mexico has been charged for conspiracy to grow marijuana with the intent to distribute it and damage to public lands and natural resources, according to federal prosecutors. 
Everado Cuadro Campos, 49, who is from Michoacan, Mexico, was arrested July 17 at a “marijuana garden” in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Shasta County, according to a news release by the United States Department of Justice. 
U.S. Forest Service and California Department of Fish and Wildlife agents found a marijuana cultivation site near Rock Creek, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint, and entered through a “well-worn” path. A Forest Service special agent noticed plastic water lines that diverted water from a drainage area of the nearby creek. 
The piping led the agents to a campsite, where a rifle, homemade spear, and knives were found, the complaint said. Agents followed the trail down to marijuana growth site, where they heard footsteps and Campos appeared, though he ran as soon as he saw the agents, the complaint said. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
Campos was chased by a California Department of Fish and Wildlife dog who stopped him, and officers arrested him, the complaint said. 
Campos said that he was hired by a “co-conspirator who eluded apprehension at the time of his arrest,” according to the complaint. Agents removed 2,079 marijuana plants from the farm. 
Campos faces at least 10 years in prison and a $10 million fine for the marijuana manufacturing and distribution charges, if convicted. Charges for environmental crimes carry a penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. 
Campos was found guilty of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver in Iowa in 1995, court documents show. During his trial for that incident, it was found that he was not a legal resident of the United States. Campos was deported after spending “no more than” 5 years in custody. 
The same court document said that Campos had been discovered in the United States again in 2005 and was sent back to Mexico. 
Campos’ current immigration status is unknown.

rlillis@sacbee.com 
Just a few blocks from where you can buy cage-free eggs and organic kale every Saturday morning at the Midtown Farmer’s Market, another market – allegedly illicit – has been operating for several weeks in Sacramento. 
Instead of fruits and veggies, the operators of the 11:30 Club on 26th Street in midtown have been illegally selling marijuana out of a ""farmer's market,"" according to a civil complaint filed May 10 in Sacramento Superior Court by the city of Sacramento. 
The city attorney alleged the operators of the club have been selling cannabis – and allowing it to be consumed on-site during events – without a city permit since at least March, causing a neighborhood nuisance. 
On Thursday, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against the club, prohibiting its owners from holding more marijuana events. If they do, the operators could be arrested for violating a court order, City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood said. The operators are also facing fines of up to $25,000. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
“They just took it upon themselves and said, ‘We’re going to have this here,’” Wood said. “They never filed an application (for a permit). They’re not meeting any of our regulations.” 
William Hennessee, an operator of the facility, said the club only provides marijuana to people cleared to purchase medical marijuana and ""is not a recreational use facility in any way, shape or form."" 
Hennessee said the club would not hold an event at the 26th Street location while the restraining order is in effect, but said he did organize an event Thursday night at a different location that was attended by 500 people. He said he would hold other ""pop-up"" events in Sacramento at locations that he will provide only to his club's 1,000 members. 
""I'm trying to provide a location that is safe for patients besides being forced to smoke in our houses where our children watch and consume secondhand smoke,"" he said. 
Hennessee said his club objects to recreational use of marijuana and hopes the city one day allows for on-site consumption of marijuana at cannabis lounges like those in San Francisco. 
""We're supposed to be a farm-to-fork capital but I guess that only applies to fruits and vegetables,"" he said. 
As City Hall begins maneuvering the evolving world of cannabis regulations, public events where the product is sold and consumed have become a new issue. 
The City Council approved a two-day festival and concert at Cal Expo this month that was run by industry magazine High Times. The event was attended by thousands and was the first permitted event for on-site consumption in California since recreational use of marijuana became legal. 
What has been happening at the 11:30 Club was not legal, authorities said. 
From the street, the 11:30 Club looks like any other warehouse nestled against the railroad tracks on the northern edge of midtown. A fence covered in a black tarp blocks the main entrance at the end of 26th Street. There’s a mailbox, “Private Property” sign and dumpster out front. Next door is another industrial-looking building also blocked by a chain link fence. 
Court documents and testimony by police officers and neighbors allege the property was anything but ordinary. 
An undercover police officer declared in court documents that he attended an event at the club on May 3. 
The cop said he saw more than a dozen “popup style canopies” with tables containing marijuana products. There was a BBQ smoke pit and ""several individuals that appeared to be smoking from a glass bong and several smoking from blunts (marijuana cigarettes),” the officer told city attorneys, according to his declaration. The officer also bought a half-ounce of weed for $50 and “marijuana infused cupcakes."" 
The club has attracted speeding vehicles, loud gatherings and loitering, neighbors told the city. 
One nearby resident told the city he saw a line of people one block long waiting to get into the 11:30 Club on March 22. “Many of these people were consuming cannabis in public,” the resident said, according to a declaration of his statements filed in court. 
Another resident said she walked to the club during an event on March 31 and was told there would be gatherings three to four times a week. The organizers told her “there wasn’t anything I could do about it,” according to court files.

RLillis@sacbee.com 
Marijuana lovers will be able to light up at the Lauryn Hill concert this weekend after all. 
Despite the objections of the City Council member whose district represents the Cal Expo fairgrounds, the council approved a one-time license for marijuana consumption at the facility at this weekend’s Cannabis Cup festival. 
By a 6-2 vote, the council approved a permit for on-site consumption and sales of marijuana at the Cannabis Cup on Friday and Saturday. Councilman Jeff Harris, whose district covers Cal Expo, and Councilwoman Angelique Ashby were the lone “no” votes. This will be the first permitted event for on-site consumption in the state since recreational use has been allowed. 
Harris said the city has tried to adopt marijuana policy “slowly and methodically and transparently.” But he said he was not made aware of the Cannabis Cup request for on-site consumption until 12 days ago and that the council has not debated the broader topic of public consumption of marijuana. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
“I don’t think we’re ready for this type of event in Sacramento,” he said. “We’ve never had a conversation about adult use in public. This is a big conversation to have.” 
The state has the authority to allow on-site marijuana consumption at events on fairgrounds, but only if the local government approves the request. 
Adam Levin, CEO of High Times, which is operating the festival, said the company thought it had the proper approvals prior to last week. “Unfortunately we came up in error,” he said. “And we worked to rectify the situation.” 
Joe Devlin, the city’s chief of cannabis policy, said the event would generate more than $200,000 in local tax revenue. He said High Times had developed a “comprehensive security plan” that was approved by law enforcement and had organized a ride share program for those attending the festival. 
High Times “has a distinguished track record of hosting safe, successful and compliant cannabis events,” Devlin said. 
The musical lineup for Cannabis Cup includes acclaimed artists, including Hill, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Rich The Kid, Cypress Hill, Rick Ross and Ludacris. The festival is expected to draw 15,000 visitors. 
Councilman Jay Schenirer acknowledged that the city would have already debated the broader policy of on-site consumption at events “in a perfect world,” but that he doesn’t expect that debate to occur for a while. 
Schenirer said he supported the license because of the financial impact the event will have, saying the $200,000 tax windfall “honestly is very attractive to me because of the needs of the city.”

39,39,CA,www.sacbee.com,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article194066459.html,Sacramento pot dispensaries are running low on this one type of product | The Sacramento Bee,"Less than two weeks after recreational pot sales became legal in California, some of Sacramento’s dispensaries already are complaining about supply problems. 
Curtis Ducart, purchasing manager for River City Phoenix and Hugs Sacramento, said the dispensaries haven’t been able to stock many of the edible marijuana products that are popular with people who consume cannabis but don’t like to smoke it. He said the dispensaries only have been able to secure products from three manufacturers instead of the 10 they used when they served only medical customers. 
In going from a medical-marijuana market to a retail market, California’s cannabis industry has had to make some quick adjustments because state regulations weren’t released until about a month before the Jan. 1 start of retail sales. Few sectors of the industry were pinched as hard as the edibles market, as the state approved potency limits that were generally lower than what was sold to medical customers and required the edibles to be divided into portions. 
“For people who don’t like to smoke, this is quite concerning,” Ducart said. “A lot of the edible companies are two to three months away from being able to sell.” 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
Kimberly Cargile, owner of A Therapeutic Alternative dispensary, said she has the same problem with edibles. “We had a huge selection before and now we have only a few kinds,” she said. 
In a state with as much marijuana as California, it might be hard to imagine a supply shortage. But the supply chain is a new system, and it requires licensed operators to only work with other licensed operators. State and local regulators have acknowledged that it will take time before the state’s marijuana supply chain is operating efficiently, and interruptions should be expected. 
“There is no supply shortage, but there is a permitting crisis, and it is especially severe in the Sacramento/Gold Country region,” said Hezekiah Allen of the California Growers Association. 
Nevada, Colorado and Washington had supply shortages after the start of legalization. 
Sacramento pot czar Joe Devlin said a lack of licensed distributors could create supply problems. Under state law, licensed distribution companies must ship cannabis products from cultivators, manufacturers and testing facilities to retail dispensaries. 
The Bureau of Cannabis Control has licensed 66 distribution companies statewide and two in Sacramento. Devlin attributes the low number of distributors to the relatively short time that the state system has been in place, and he thinks companies will fill the void quickly. 
“We won’t be talking about this in a couple of months,” he said. 
Devlin’s counterpart at the state, Lori Ajax of the Bureau of Cannabis Control, also has expressed optimism that the distribution problem will work itself out. 
Ducart said a lack of distributors has created some hangups for his dispensaries although not as much as the shortage of edibles. 
Another supply issue for Sacramento dispensaries is all the nearby counties with bans on commercial grows, including Placer and Nevada, Allen said. Some dispensaries had agreements with growers in those counties before the bans were enacted.

Organizers expected upwards of 15,000 people over the course of the two-day festival, which boasts musical performances from acclaimed artists, including Lauryn Hill, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Rich The Kid, Cypress Hill, Rick Ross and Ludacris. 
The event was at risk of becoming a music-only festival until the Sacramento City Council approved a license for on-site consumption and sales in a 6-2 vote Tuesday. Weeks earlier, a similar High Times event had its permit denied by the San Bernardino City Council just before it was scheduled to take place. 
At Cal Expo, crowds maneuvered their way through the rows of booths Friday afternoon, sometimes stopping to take long drags from blunts or sample products. In between puffs from a neatly-rolled joint, Brian Johnson said he was grateful to the city for approving the license. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
“I think it was really cool for the city of Sacramento to trust the cannabis community to do something like this,"" Johnson said. ""I think we’ll hold up our end and have a great event with no mishaps. We’re just out here having fun, trying to socialize and enjoy our products."" 
Other attendees, like medical marijuana user William Bennett, said they simply came to learn more about the cannabis industry. 
Bennett said he wanted tips for growing marijuana at home. Bennett, who said he suffers from chronic pain caused by a back injury, began using medical marijuana about five years ago as an alternative to prescription opiate painkillers, which he said caused him unbearable side effects. Bennett has since started to grow his own. 
“I’m kind of on the fence with recreational, but in the long run, it’s better than people drinking and doing other things,"" Bennett said. ""You don’t hear about people having big brawls and fights at (events like this). Everyone’s just sitting back.” 
Bennett's wife, Dianne Kirk-Bennett, said she was impressed with how expansive and well-organized the event was. 
“If this is your thing, this is the place to be,” Kirk-Bennett said. 
The event has approximately 280 vendors, selling marijuana-themed apparel and art, vape pens, concentrates, topicals, edibles and a variety of other cannabis products. 
High Times Chief Revenue Officer Matt Stang said it felt ""incredible"" to host the event, which he characterized as a watershed moment for the industry. 
""It gives me a feeling that we’ve really progressed as a country. We’ve come to a point where we can have a peaceful gathering to consume and purchase cannabis with a state sanction,"" Stang said. ""The ability to do this legally — it’s been a long fight. High Times has been doing this for 44 years. We started as the voice of the opposition, and now we’ve grown into the majority. "" 
Security was tight during for the strictly 21-and-up event. Unlike most music festivals, no alcohol sales were allowed. 
Joe Devlin, Sacramento's chief of cannabis policy, said the event would generate more than $200,000 in tax revenue. Devlin said High Times “has a distinguished track record of hosting safe, successful and compliant cannabis events,” noting that the company had developed a “comprehensive security plan” that was approved by law enforcement and had organized a ride share program for those attending the festival. 
Stang said High Times had contracted with two separate security firms to ensure no attendees purchased more than the legally-allowed amount and to check for impaired drivers. Ticket buyers were given Uber and Lyft codes at the time of purchase in order to minimize the risk of attendees driving under the influence. 
For those in the industry, the event served as a safe demonstration to convince skeptics and state government officials. 
“We want to make sure that people understand what a great, compliant, adult-use event can be, because we want this to be the model for the rest of the country,"" Stang said. 
Thousands attended the Cannabis Cup, California's first ever legal festival to buy and consume marijuana, weed, pot and edibles at Cal Expo in Sacramento on May 4, 2018.

41,41,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/medical-marijuana-recommendation/,Increase Your Cannabis Savings with a Medical Marijuana Recommendation,"The passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 made California the sixth state to allow the recreational use of cannabis. Yet nearly two-and-a-half years into cannabis legalization, many Californians are still choosing to see a cannabis doctor. But why? 
The truth is, there are 332 California municipalities that have full bans on cannabis activities. Here are the stats as of May 2018: 
These numbers may change as legalization progresses but, as you can see, you’re clearly more likely to obtain legal cannabis with a medical marijuana recommendation. 
You enjoy several perks that just don’t apply to recreational users. 
(*Because of Measure BB, backed and passed by Weedmaps, Santa Ana medical cannabis patients under the age of 21 cannot purchase cannabis without their parents’ or guardians’ presence.) 
MMICs, or medical marijuana identification cards, are different than medical marijuana recommendations. A MMIC registers you in a state-run database for easy verification without the need for personal info like address, Social Security or phone number. All that’s required is the card number.

MMICs are protected by HIPPA regulations so your info won’t appear in background checks or elsewhere. Additionally, a state MMJ ID card is the only way to obtain a state, and sometimes local, sales tax exemption.

Patients who can’t afford to pay the MMIC fee (now limited to $100 or less) can apply for a waiver. Those on Medi-Cal can receive their state-issued cards for $50 or less. 
MMJ recs are by far the most common and preferred option of cannabis patient identification; most never obtain a MMIC and simply opt for a rec. All of the above MMIC benefits still apply, except for the sales tax. Recommendations are also not registered or stored in any state databases and covered under HIPPA.

A medical marijuana recommendation through NuggMD costs a mere $39, or $59 for it plus a wallet-sized cannabis photo ID card (a more convenient way to carry). 
NuggMD has used their experience as the nation’s largest telemedicine service to provide the most simplified, affordable and streamlined service at the lowest possible price. They connect you to a registered cannabis doctor from any internet connected device with a camera, anywhere. Plus, you’ll only be charged if the doctor believes MMJ is right for you.

The average online process takes about 15-25 minutes, but take all the time you need with the doctor until you’re comfortable with medical cannabis. When approved, you instantly receive your recommendation via email, which you can immediately use to order from Nugg, until the hard copy comes in a few days. 
NuggMD’s services don’t end after your recommendation. You also have access to a team of trained and incredibly knowledgeable cannabis concierges who will help you better understand how cannabis can meet your medical needs and improve your life.

Why such hands-on service? Because NuggMD’s founders believe you are the lynchpin of the cannabis community. “Anyone can provide ordinary services and try to cash in on the new green rush. Most of those companies won’t be here 10 years from now because they don’t recognize that the most important part of the cannabis industry isn’t the cannabis – it’s the cannabis consumer. After all, good cannabis isn’t hard to find anymore, but good customer service is.”

Find out for yourself why over 250,000 Californians have trusted NuggMD to service their MMJ needs and visit them online now!"
42,42,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/truth-lies-marijuana/,"Truth, lies and marijuana","I am worried because hate groups and fake news are on the rise, even here in San Francisco. 
In a couple days, an anti-LGBT hate group will have the opportunity to address the Board of Supervisors and ask for their votes. They are appealing a decision by the Planning Commission — and they might even win, which is why I’m raising the alarm. 
On Tuesday, the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) and its local allies will ask my former colleagues on the board to stop The Apothecarium from opening a medical cannabis dispensary in the Sunset District. 
This should be simple. Sunset voters have overwhelmingly supported marijuana at the polls every time the issue has come before them. The Planning Commission voted 5-1 to approve the dispensary, and The Apothecarium is one of The City’s most respected dispensaries. But PJI and its network of right-wing, conservative Christian allies are pushing back. 
This fight matters because the truth matters. PJI is a group that does not dwell in the realm of truth. Like our president, the group lies easily, reflexively and constantly. They have held news conferences claiming that people have died of marijuana overdoses. They have predicted gunfire in the Sunset if the dispensary opens. 
These are fear-mongering lies. It’s important that we call them out clearly and simply for what they are: lies. In all of recorded history, no one has ever died of a marijuana overdose. And gunfire? That’s laughable. For 25 years, San Francisco has had medical cannabis dispensaries, peacefully. I can’t remember the last time I heard of a serious issue arising because of a dispensary. 
PJI isn’t an ordinary hate group. They combine a veneer of legal respectability with outreach to communities of color — especially my own community, Chinese Americans. This is a new force in San Francisco politics: right-wing Christian groups successfully organizing in the Chinese community. 
So far, they’ve been effective. A couple months ago, PJI and its partners turned out 700 people — the vast majority of them Chinese American — to testify against the dispensary. Virtually every word spoken against the project was based on PJI’s lies and propaganda. 
Some claimed that traffic deaths would rise. (That’s a lie; states with legal marijuana see traffic deaths go down by around 10 percent.) Others claimed that teen use of marijuana would skyrocket. (That’s also a lie; teen use of marijuana has stayed flat or gone down both nationally and in Colorado.) Still, others said a dispensary would bring crime to the Sunset neighborhood. (This is another easily disproved lie; peer-reviewed data shows that dispensaries deter crime.) 
If all these arguments have a familiar ring to them, that’s no surprise. For decades, PJI has used a version of these false arguments against the LGBT community. That’s why they have been designated an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
PJI has pushed the lie that homosexuality is caused by child abuse. They have promoted the harmful and discredited practice of reparative therapy, which seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation. Now, they are directing their “What about the children?!” hysteria toward cannabis patients. 
It is tempting to dismiss PJI as clowns. But they successfully overturned an earlier attempt to open a medical cannabis dispensary in the Sunset and have clearly made inroads with conservative Christian Chinese organizers in the Bay Area. 
While many San Franciscans are rightly focused on fighting hate groups at the national level, we must not allow PJI and its allies to gain a further foothold in our city or our political discourse. 
If a right-wing group can convince the Board of Supervisors to vote with them — undoing the clearly expressed will of the voters — then we are in very deep trouble. 
Eric Mar is a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and Board of Education. He is also a cannabis patient."
43,43,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/legal-cannabis-sales-begin-monday-california-not-sf/,"Legal cannabis sales begin Monday in California, but not in SF","The historic moment of legal marijuana sales begins Monday in cities throughout California, but those in San Francisco will have to wait until at least next weekend to buy recreational weed. 
A number of San Francisco’s existing medical dispensaries are working through both City Hall’s Office of Cannabis and the state’s Bureau of Cannabis Control to obtain approval to begin selling the drug to adults over 21. 
Businesses need to obtain both a state license and local approval before that happens. None have yet. 
Because the Board of Supervisors did not approve legislation regulating recreational cannabis sales until Dec. 5, the law won’t take effect locally until Jan. 6 — the earliest sales can begin. 
The board had stumbled in meeting the Jan. 1 milestone amid significant political pressure from a segment of the Chinese community, who took an anti-cannabis stance and showed up en mass at City Hall to urge strict regulations — and even for The City to ban weed altogether. Ultimately, the board crafted rules to the satisfaction of the cannabis industry, such as by reducing the distance cannabis outlets must be from schools from 1,000 feet to 600 feet. 
It was unclear Friday if retail sales will begin Jan. 6. Nicole Elliott, the Office of Cannabis director, said it’s possible — but not certain. 
“The City is working hard to prepare operators for temporary adult use sales as early as Jan. 6 and we are reviewing operators’ security plans, good neighbor policies and equity plans at this time,” Elliott told the San Francisco Examiner. 
She said not until she gives the approval can state licenses be officially granted to local shops, but dispensaries can go through the two approval processes concurrently. 
Many already are. 
The rollout has had at least one mixup. The state granted the first adult use cannabis sales permit in San Francisco to Flower Power Dispensary at 70th Second St., which was confirmed by Alex Traverso, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Cannabis Control. 
That news, however, came as a surprise to Elliott, who said she hadn’t authorized any dispensaries to receive state licenses to sell retail cannabis and that “it will be undone.” 
Sure enough, later that day, what was the first adult use retail cannabis license granted in San Francisco was revoked. “The adult use license was issued in error,” Traverso said in an email after being asked to respond to Elliott’s comment. “We’ve revoked the adult use license for now, pending city approval.” 
Flower Power did not respond to requests for comment. 
Elliott provided the Examiner with a list of 20 medical dispensaries that are furthest along in the local approval process to begin selling retail cannabis. 
They include the three locations of The Apothecarium. 
“We are hoping to start recreational sales at The Apothecarium’s Castro, SoMa and Marina stores on January 6,” Eliot Dobris, The Apothecarium’s spokesperson, said Friday. “We are hopeful that at least one of them will be permitted for recreational sales on January 6. However, like other San Francisco dispensaries, we are still waiting to receive our city permits.” 
He added The Apothecarium has planned a promotion on Jan. 6 to celebrate the historic moment. There will be a 20 percent discount off one’s purchase if they bring their mother. “We want people to know that The Apothecarium is a safe and friendly place where you can feel comfortable bringing your mother,” Dobris said. 
The City is most immediately focused on existing dispensaries starting to sell recreational cannabis. But The City will also soon start allowing new outlets to open, but only through an equity program meant to provide redress for the impacts of the war on drugs. To be considered for the equity program, applicants must meet certain criteria, such as having been arrested for cannabis crimes. 
Applications for these new business are not yet available. “We are seeking to make applications available in the first quarter of 2018,” Elliott said. 
Former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, California’s current lieutenant governor running for governor, said in a Dec. 21 tweet that, “Legalizing marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform.” 
He wrote, “It’s about ending the failed war on drugs and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities.” 
The new era of legal cannabis officially begins Monday, after voters approved Proposition 64 last year. Statewide, the cannabis industry is expected to have more than $7 billion in sales annually and generate an estimated $1 billion in tax revenues. The industry is also expected to serve as a growing job sector. 
The City is exploring creating a job-training program similar to the one it has for construction work to help residents gain employment in the cannabis industry, such as in retail, back office and manufacturing. 
“We will leverage our robust training programs we offer today in hospitality, healthcare, and construction to train and connect residents to new jobs in the cannabis industry,” said Katherine Daniel, a deputy director with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. “Like any emerging sector we will look for opportunities to create new or additional training to better prepare residents for these jobs.” 
As of Friday morning, the Bureau of Cannabis Control said it had issued 174 permits for cannabis operations throughout the state, including for medical, adult use retail, distribution and micro-businesses. There were 691 pending applications."
44,44,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/california-laws-owning-operating-cannabis-business/,California laws for owning and operating a cannabis business,"This week’s question comes from Robin D. in San Francisco, who asks: 
Q: “I understand that marijuana (cannabis) will be come legal in 2018. Some friends and I are thinking of starting a retail cannabis store. We currently own a liquor store and want to know about the new laws, so we don’t get busted for illegal distribution.” 
A: Robin, I am not a cannabis attorney, and we do not represent people who sell or buy marijuana in either criminal or civil proceedings (except for suing distributors for mislabeling, defective products and those who cause injury under the influence). Here is a very general analysis of the new laws relating to the ownership and operation of cannabis businesses, but if you wish to pursue this line of business, contact a lawyer with specific knowledge in this area for guidance. 
Cannabis is about to be legal (and heavily regulated). To deal with the myriad issues related to legalized marijuana, California has charged some existing regulatory bodies -— the Department of Food and Agriculture (for cultivators), the Department of Public Health (for manufacturers) and the Department of Consumer Affair’s Bureau of Cannabis Control (for retailers, distributors and testers) — with developing regulations to implement the new cannabis laws. The Departments of Agriculture and Public Health have long been established; the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) is a new division within the Department of Consumer Affairs. 
The new regulations set forth by the BCC are designed to regulate cannabis business operations. Some of the regulations are designed to identify and restrict any criminal enterprises from engaging in cannabis sales. For example, Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations (when laws are passed, the agencies are tasked with drafting regulations for their implementation, which are published in the CCR) Section 5002 requires those who want to sell cannabis to obtain a license  and renew it annually and, in doing so, to identify not only who will own and operate the business but also who the investors are and where the funds for the operation come from, as well as where the funds for the enterprise are kept, such as bank accounts. 
An applicant for a license must disclose whether they have an interest in any other cannabis operations, as well as any prior criminal convictions, a detailed description of the offenses leading to convictions, dates of incarceration, probation, parole and other criminal history. According to the regulations, a prior conviction, in which the sentence, including any term of probation, incarceration or supervised release, is completed for possession of, possession for sale, sale, manufacture, transportation or cultivation of a controlled substance shall not be the sole ground for denial of a license. Conviction for any controlled substance felony after licensure shall be grounds for revocation of a license or denial of the renewal of a license. 
When considering prior criminal offense, the BCC will consider the nature of the offense, including the severity of the offense, whether the offense would be a felony under current law at the time of the application (many drug crimes that were felonies at the time of their occurrence have now been decriminalized), the applicant’s criminal record, the time since the offense occurred and any evidence of rehabilitation in determining whether a permit should be issued. 
The regulations state that a criminal conviction of any person holding a license to sell marijuana, which occurs after the license has been issued, must notify the BCC within 48 hours of such a conviction and the conviction may be the basis of revocation of the license or refusal to reissue the license. 
Regulations prohibit any individual holding office in any state agency that regulates marijuana, as well as any persons employed by the state’s Department of Justice or any district attorney’s office, city attorney’s office, sheriff’s office or local police department, from holding a license to sell marijuana. 
If you or any of your partners work in such a capacity, you cannot be owners of the business. 
You should also be aware that a landlord may refuse to rent to you, and an applicant must demonstrate that a landlord has provided written approval for their premises to be used as a marijuana business. 
If you decide to go forward with your plan, you will need to provide evidence of $2 million in liability insurance and post a $5,000 bond to ensure payment of the cost incurred for the destruction of cannabis goods necessitated by any violation of the regulations. 
Be aware that cannabis, like alcohol, may be sold only to people ages 21 or over. However, unlike alcohol, cannabis may be sold to an individual 18 or older who has a valid physician recommendation. 
Lastly, while a retailer may sell noncannabis products in their shop, cannabis can not be sold where alcohol, alcohol products, tobacco and tobacco products are sold.

Sessions’ decision to rescind President Barack Obama’s policy is a significant step backward for marijuana advocates who have fought for decades to legalize the drug. The decision creates uncertainty around whether the federal government will start cracking down on the recreational cannabis industry in California, which became legal Monday as a result of voter-approved Proposition 64. 
SEE RELATED: Legal cannabis sales begin Monday in California, but not in SF 
Both San Francisco’s Office of Cannabis and California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control said Thursday they will continue with existing plans to permit new recreational marijuana businesses. 
Businesses need approval from both agencies to begin selling retail cannabis in San Francisco. The earliest legal cannabis sales can be permitted under local law is Saturday. None had yet to gain approval to do so as of Thursday afternoon. 
“We will respect the will of the voters and continue to move forward in implementing state law,” Acting Mayor London Breed, who is also serving as president of the Board of Supervisors, said Thursday. 
She continued, “Here in San Francisco, we have worked hard during the last year to put a regulatory structure in place that will reinvest in communities that have historically been affected by the war on drugs and ensure that adult use sales are safe and responsible.” 
Lori Ajax, chief of California’s Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, said Thursday they are conferring with the California attorney general and other states on the matter, but will proceed. 
“We expect the federal government to respect the rights of states and the votes of millions of people across America and if they won’t, Congress should act,” Ajax said in a statement Thursday. “Regardless, we’ll continue to move forward with the state’s regulatory processes covering both medicinal and adult-use cannabis consistent with the will of California’s voters, while defending our state’s laws to the fullest extent.” 
For San Francisco, a long-time leader on medical marijuana, the conflict and confusion over federal drug enforcement is nothing new. In 2012, for instance, the U.S. Justice Department sent threatening letters to landlords of pot clubs in San Francisco, which prompted the closure of prominent cannabis operators. 
Sessions’ new marijuana enforcement policy issued in a memo Thursday comes as legal cannabis has gained growing acceptance and recreational use is now legal in eight states as well as Washington, D.C. 
Sessions said in a statement Thursday that the Obama-era marijuana enforcement policy “undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission.” 
He continued, “Therefore, today’s memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.” 
Obama’s administration had faced sharp criticism from cannabis advocates for federal government enforcement against marijuana, such as by sending threatening letters to landlords of pot shops and raiding establishments, leading to such headlines as “Obama’s War on Pot.” But subsequent Obama policy helped usher in legalization, notably the guidance from his Deputy Attorney General James Cole in August 2013, which essentially promised no federal prosecution for medical and recreational cannabis activities as long as it was regulated by states and local governments. 
Sessions, a President Donald Trump appointment, rescinded the August 2013 Cole memo Thursday, along with other policies, and instead said enforcement of marijuana laws is up to the discretion of  U.S. attorneys in the districts they represent. 
Sessions’ memo notes that “marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime” and says in deciding to pursue prosecution of marijuana activity, federal prosecutors should weigh the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect it would have. 
It’s not immediately clear what impacts this may have on California’s new legal recreational cannabis industry, which is estimated to generate $7 billion annually in sales and $1 billion in tax revenue. 
Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor and candidate for California governor, blasted Sessions’ decision. Newsom, himself a proponent of cannabis legalization, said it “flies in the face of the overwhelming public opinion of a vast majority of Americans, who support marijuana legalization.” 
Newsom said in the statement, “Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration destructively doubled down on the failed, costly and racially discriminatory policy of marijuana criminalization.” 
While recreational sales began Monday in some cities where pot shops obtained state and local permits, those in San Francisco cannot begin selling recreational cannabis until Saturday at the earliest under legislation approved last month by the Board of Supervisors and mayor regulating the recreational cannabis industry. 
Only existing medical dispensaries in San Francisco can begin selling retail cannabis this weekend, and only after obtaining a state license from California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control, which cannot be issued without authorization from The City’s Office of Cannabis. 
The Office of Cannabis was reviewing about 20 applications from dispensaries that sought to start selling retail cannabis, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported. These businesses are required to submit such required documents as a “good neighbor” policy, a security plan and a plan to foster more equity, such as through hiring employees who were arrested in the past for cannabis crimes. 
Applicants remain hopeful they will receive approval to begin selling recreational cannabis on Saturday. 
Existing medical marijuana dispensaries are also required to obtain a permit to continue to sell medical cannabis. Twenty dispensaries and three delivery services in San Francisco obtained such permits, according to the Bureau of Cannabis Control’s database. 
“The city and county of San Francisco continues to work towards bringing all operators in compliance with state and local law,” Nicole Elliott, director of the Office of Cannabis, said in a statement. “In 2016, the majority of voters demanded this activity be legalized to allow for the thoughtful regulation of activity that has been occurring for decades. This regulation will serve to create a safer environment for our communities and consumers.”"

The Board of Supervisors Land Use and Transportation Committee unanimously approved the ban Monday and forwarded it to the full board for a vote. 
The ban, introduced by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, comes after the board last year approved citywide regulations that ushered in the new era of legal recreational cannabis, following voter approval of Proposition 64. The regulations were hotly contested by some in the Chinese-American community who opposed the entire industry and viewed cannabis as a harmful drug. 
SEE RELATED: Mayor Lee expected to sign into law SF’s recreational cannabis regulations Wednesday 
Peskin, who represents Chinatown, said he was respecting the wishes of Chinatown residents. Distancing himself from reefer madness, Peskin said the ban proposal centers “around concerns about gentrification and rents that Chinatown has been fighting.” 
Mayor London Breed also expressed support for the ban during her campaign, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported. 
The committee’s support comes despite the Planning Commission voting 5 to 2 on June 14 to reject the proposal. Commissioners objected to taking a piecemeal approach to cannabis regulations and emphasized the importance of having an equitable approach for all neighborhoods. 
Peskin noted the commission is advisory, and pointed to a letter sent in April by Wing Hoo Leung, president of the Community Tenants Association, in support of the pot ban. 
“At least until this newly-legal industry stabilizes, the prospect of high rents that cannabis retail can afford is causing property owners to hold out on renting vacant commercial space and, in some instances, to raise the rents of existing community-serving retail space – sometimes doubling them – in order to replace them with higher rent businesses. Our fragile commercial corridors in Chinatown will not survive this pressure,” he wrote. 
The letter also complained that “Chinatown [single-room occupancy] buildings are old, the walls are often thin, and secondhand smoke continues to be a problem for many of our tenants.” 
Supervisor Ahsha Safai had previously tried to impose a ban on additional pot businesses in the Excelsior neighborhood he represents but the board shot it down when enacting the new cannabis regulations. 
“I really appreciate the theme of respecting the district supervisor’s wishes when it comes to issues like this. So hopefully we will have further conversation in the months to come,” Safai said. 
He later confirmed to the Examiner he may try again to get a cap approved for the Excelsior."

Gascon announced on Wednesday that his office will immediately dismiss and seal 3,038 misdemeanor convictions and review another 4,940 more serious felony convictions that could be reduced and resentenced. 
“We want to address the wrongs that were caused by the failures of the War on Drugs for many years in this country and begin to fix the harm that was done not only to the entire nation but specifically to communities of color,” Gascon said.

Under Prop. 64, California voters legalized recreational cannabis for adults over the age of 21 beginning in January. Prop. 64 also allowed those convicted of marijuana offenses to petition their cases for dismissal or reduction to a lesser offense. 
But Gascon said only 23 people in San Francisco and 4,885 people in California have used Prop. 64 to petition their cases so far. Gascon’s plan is to begin the process automatically in San Francisco without those who are eligible having to hire an attorney or come to court. 
“We will do all the work for them,” Gascon said. 
The criminal justice system has disproportionately targeted people of color in San Francisco and across the nation, with drug offenses creating barriers to employment and housing for minorities. Gascon said that as many as 2.8 million Californians were arrested on cannabis offenses between 1915 and 2016. 
“This is a giant step toward justice and it is a stride toward getting black people free to live in the community, to have jobs, to have health care, to have decent education,” said Rev. Amos Brown, leader of the local chapter of the NAACP. 
Supervisor Malia Cohen, who represents the Bayview, said the effort goes hand-in-hand with the equity program she spearheaded to benefit cannabis dispensary applicants previously convicted of drug-related crimes. 
“It’s the marrying of our political ideology, finally, in lockstep with our policy,” Cohen said. 
Gascon announced the plan at a Hall of Justice news conference Wednesday alongside Brown, Cohen, Office of Cannabis Director Nicole Elliott, Supervisor Jeff Sheehy and Laura Thomas of the Drug Policy Alliance. 
Gascon said those with cannabis misdemeanor offenses should check to see if their records have been cleared in the coming months. 
The felony cases require a second layer of review and take longer to be resentenced."

Medithrive, Grass Roots and Harvest on Geary became the first three medical marijuana dispensaries to obtain approval from the Office of Cannabis and then late Friday from the state Bureau of Cannabis Control to sell recreational cannabis.

Both Grass Roots, at 1077 Post St., and Harvest on Geary, at 4811 Geary Blvd., confirmed to the San Francisco Examiner they would begin selling recreational cannabis Saturday morning. Medithrive did not confirm sales. 
Grass Roots said they would begin sales at 8 a.m. Harvest on Geary is expected to begin sales at 9 a.m. 
“We’re grateful to be participating in this momentous day,” said Harvest on Geary owner Marty Higgins. 
Higgins said they have been preparing for months with inventory and staffing. 
Recreational cannabis became legal on Monday throughout California after voters approved Proposition 64 last year. While recreational sales began in other cities on New Year’s Day, San Francisco law regulating recreational cannabis allowed sales to begin on Saturday, at the earliest. 
After the initial first three adult sales permits were granted, more dispensaries received state licenses to sell retail cannabis, including ReLeaf Herbal Cooperative, at 1284 Mission St., and The Green Cross, at 4218 Mission Street, according to the Bureau of Cannabis database. 
The Apothecarium, at 2029 Market St., said they also obtained a state license to sell retail sales and plan to have a ribbon cutting ceremony with State Sen. Scott Wiener and Supervisor Jeff Sheehy beginning at 8:15 am, with doors opening for sales at 9 am.

The seven dispensaries in San Francisco that may seek a state license to begin selling marijuana are: 
– Grass Roots, at 1077 Post St.
– Harvest on Geary, at 4811 Geary Blvd.
– MediThrive, at 1933 Mission St.
– Shambhala, at 2441 Mission St.
– ReLeaf Herbal Cooperative, at 1284 Mission St.
– The Apothecarium, at 2029 Market St.
– The Green Cross, at 4218 Mission St. 
Alex Traverso, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, said the state hoped to issue licenses to the seven dispensaries Friday. 
“We just received The City’s approved list a few hours ago,” Traverso told the San Francisco Examiner. “[We’re] working to get those seven licensed by [close of business] today, if possible.” 
The City has received 31 submissions to date from dispensaries seeking authorization to sell adult-use recreational marijuana. City officials said those submissions are being reviewed in the order in which they were received by the Department of Public Health, the Police Department and the Office of Cannabis.

California ushered in a new era with legalized cannabis on New Year’s Day, with numerous Bay Area locations celebrating the occasion. However, those in San Francisco cannot begin selling recreational cannabis until Saturday at the earliest under legislation approved last month by the Board of Supervisors and mayor regulating the recreational cannabis industry, the San Francisco Examiner previously reported. 
“As San Francisco implements legal adult-use cannabis, we look forward to the benefits to consumers, who will be able to know that they are buying products that are regulated and tested for quality and safety,” Health Department Director Barbara Garcia said in a statement. “We anticipate working together with retailers to ensure that consumers are given information about the safe consumption of the products, so that the transition goes smoothly and successfully for everyone.” 
Office of Cannabis Director Nicole Elliott acknowledged the significance of The City’s decision to proceed with authorizing recreational marijuana sales. 
“The City has been working diligently and swiftly to move the cannabis industry to a regulated space so that our small businesses can be in compliance with state and local law – laws that are meant to better protect our communities and consumers,” she said in a statement. “Today marks an important transition in our endeavors, and I appreciate these retailers’ commitment to being good neighbors and to creating a safer and more equitable environment in San Francisco.” 
The announcement comes a day after Attorney General Jeff Sessions shared his decision Thursday to rescind the Obama-era policy of lenient enforcement of the federal law prohibiting marijuana, marking a significant step backward for marijuana advocates who have fought for decades to legalize the drug. The decision creates uncertainty around whether the federal government will start cracking down on the recreational cannabis industry in California, which became legal Monday as a result of voter-approved Proposition 64.

50,50,CA,www.sfexaminer.com,http://www.sfexaminer.com/sfs-marijuana-labor-movement-growing-new-dispensary-applicant/,SF’s marijuana labor movement growing with new dispensary applicant,"The site of San Francisco’s last gun shop that shuttered two years ago may turn into a medical marijuana dispensary. 
The Bernal Heights Cooperative’s permit application to open for business as a medical marijuana dispensary is set to go before the Planning Commission today. 
The proposed dispensary would occupy the commercial space formerly famous for being San Francisco’s last remaining gun shop, known as High Bridge Arms, at 3185 Mission St. The gun store closed when the Board of Supervisors added more restrictions on gun shops. 
The dispensary was displaced after the building where it operated out of since 2005 was sold, and a new dispensary that could pay more rent displaced it, according to dispensary applicant Sean Killen. 
The tech software worker decided to enter the marijuana industry in 2015 by helping the cooperative. Killen said The City shouldn’t allow the permit to be transferred from one dispensary to another at the same location to prevent similar building sales, displacing long-term dispensaries. 
“It’s been a work in progress ever since 2015 to just put it in a new home,” Killen said. That included paying $5,000 in rent for the former gun shop site since last year and also maintaining a site outside The City and offering a delivery service to longstanding patients. 
The application is also among the first batch of dispensary applications to heard by the Planning Commission since voters approved Proposition 64 in November, which legalized adult recreational use of marijuana. 
The application has another distinction. Killen on Tuesday signed an agreement, which was provided to the San Francisco Examiner, with United Food & Commercial Workers, Local 648, a local chapter of labor union United Food and Commercial Workers that represents a growing number workers in the marijuana industry across California. 
The union is in talks with City College of San Francisco to create an apprenticeship training program for the medical marijuana industry beginning in the spring 2018 semester. 
Killen’s agreement supports employees organizing and agrees to certain worker standards, such as at least $20 an hour in the first year of employment. Killen said it is the first such agreement with UFCW Local 648 and a dispensary. He also committed to hiring local apprentices through UFCW. 
“If we knew someone was coming in with the right knowledge I think that’s fantastic,” Killen said in support the proposed CCSF cannabis training program 
UFCW Local 648 did not return calls for comment, but member Jennifer Garcia said in an email that the union “is excited to work with Bernal Heights Cooperative and we hope that the Planning Commission approves their application to re-open.” 
The state is expected to begin in January 2018 issuing permits for recreational marijuana use in accordance with Prop. 64. 
Mayor Ed Lee has directed departments to come up with local permits by September 2017. San Francisco is expected to permit adult-use businesses and allow medical dispensaries to apply to also distribute recreational marijuana. 
The location is in the proximity of its former location at 33 29th St., where Harvest now operates out of and Cookie Co. 415 at 3139 Mission St. There is another dispensary application pending at 3326 Mission St. 
There is some opposition to the proposal. One resident wrote the commission opposing the application arguing that two other locations in the area was sufficient for patient access. 
Killen said he understands concerns of clustering, but also thought two or three wasn’t a problem. 
“The claim we are trying to make is that we are continuing our service,” Killen said. “It’s in the neighborhood still. We are just down the street from where we [were]. We are serving the same patient base.”"

			Is it legal to fly or road-trip with marijuana?		
","The July 4 weekend kicked off the first summer travel season since California voted to join seven other states in legalizing marijuana for all adults. What’s more, there are now 30 states where medical marijuana is allowed, with a couple more close to coming on board. 
So, as vacationers prepare to hit the road, many have a simple question: How can we legally mix travel and weed? 
“We have been getting lots of calls about this issue recently,” said Nico Melendez, spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration.

In California, the rules on traveling with cannabis are evolving. And conflicts between state and federal marijuana laws – and how rules are enforced among the various states or even one airport vs. another – are causing confusion. 
For recreational consumers of cannabis, the simple answer is to leave weed at home and, if desired, to unwind with a cocktail. But for medical patients who aren’t able to take along specific strains or cannabis products they use daily to combat symptoms of an illness or chronic pain, summer travel could be anything but simple. 
Here’s a closer look at what the law says, how the rules are actually playing out and what experts recommend to stay safe and legal.

It’s never legal to fly with cannabis, even if you’re traveling within a legal-weed state like California or between states that both permit marijuana. Air travel falls under federal jurisdiction, and under federal law it remains illegal to possess or transport any amount of cannabis. 
That said, TSA searchers aren’t looking for marijuana.

			Marijuana festivals, and businesses that benefit from them, are hurting now that cannabis is legal in California		
","Marijuana festival organizers were banking on this to be their biggest year yet, now that recreational cannabis is legal in California and the state is legitimizing such events by licensing them for the first time. 
Promoters say they planned to stop operating under the loose protections of the state’s medical marijuana laws, where they’d force attendees to get doctor’s recommendations for cannabis before entering the gates. Instead, they hoped to have licenses that would allow anyone 21 and older to buy and smoke cannabis, just like they can buy and drink beer at other festivals. 
But with local authorities now able to block such festivals even from the limited venues where they’re permitted by new state rules, there weren’t any state-sanctioned events in Southern California during the first half of the year. And none are on the horizon for the rest of 2018. 
Interested in more coverage of the California marijuana industry? Head to TheCannifornian.com  or subscribe to The Cannifornian newsletter to get cannabis-related news, features and more. 
The picture is a bit brighter in Northern California. The state licensed marijuana festivals this spring in Sacramento and in Santa Rosa, where the massive Emerald Cup is also expected to go off in December without a hitch. 
“It’s costing us a lot of money, but it’s going to come back in the long run,” said Tim Blake, who founded The Emerald Cup festival and competition 15 years ago. “We’re going to really be teaching them how it should be done.” 
But with many of California’s largest marijuana festivals – such as the upcoming Chalice California in Victorville – unable to secure permits to allow consumption and sales, overall attendance and revenue for promoters, vendors and fairground venues is expected to be down significantly in the first year of legalization. 
“We are taking a big hit,” said Franco Rodriguez, promoter of the High Life Music Festival, which got turned down for a marijuana sales permit by the city of San Bernardino. “Our own government is not letting the people do what we voted for.” 
People who own hotels, restaurants and other businesses near these venues are also expressing concern. They say the boost they’ve seen as tens of thousands of people have flocked to these events in the past has helped them sustain and grow their operations. 
A lawsuit over these festival rules is pending, while some organizers say they’re looking to move their events out of California. 
Other festival promoters are taking the same approach as the rest of California’s still-massive black market. They’re citing a “crippling” permit system, lingering legal gray areas and delayed enforcement as justification to keep hosting events that make it look as though nothing has changed when it comes to marijuana laws in California – even though, officially, everything has. 
Options limited 
Festivals that let people buy and smoke marijuana are now legally restricted to fairground venues authorized by the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
“There’s no other type of event to be limited to that,” Blake said. “It’s kind of ridiculous.” 
Several of the state’s 80 sanctioned fairs are defunct or share facilities. Others – such as Santa Maria Fairpark, home to the Santa Barbara County Fair – can’t host cannabis events under state law because they’re within 600 feet of schools. 
Carving out those properties leaves California with around 70 venues that can entertain the notion of permitting cannabis festivals. But the obstacles don’t end there. 
Layers of permission required 
For 20 years, medical marijuana festivals in California only needed permission from whoever owned or managed the event venue. But as of Jan. 1, companies that want to host festivals where cannabis can be sold and consumed must first get annual licenses from the state. Then, for every event they host, they need permission from the board that oversees the venue, from the city or county where the venue is located and again from the state. 
Several fair boards, such as the ones that oversee OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa and Amador County Fairgrounds & Event Center near Sacramento, have opted to ban all cannabis-themed events.

“We just don’t think it is a good fit for us here in Amador County,” said Troy Bowers, chief executive for the Northern California venue.

The Department of Food Agriculture has recommended “that each fair board set local policy about cannabis events,” according to agency spokesman Steve Lyle. But managers for some facilities, including Tehama District Fairgrounds in Northern California, said they don’t have a policy because they haven’t yet been approached about holding marijuana events. Others say their city or county already prohibits all commercial cannabis activity, so they know festivals wouldn’t get local approval anyway. 
“We have to abide by local rules and regulations,” said Dan Jacobs, general manager of the Antelope Valley Fair & Event Center in Lancaster, which blocks marijuana sales. 
Only around 10 state-sanctioned fairground venues are in cities or counties that permit recreational marijuana sales, according to a database of local marijuana policies compiled by the Southern California News Group. 
In at least two of those 10 communities, either the fair board or local authorities have already opted to block cannabis events. That leaves perhaps eight viable venues for hosting marijuana festivals in all of California, with several in remote communities far from the state’s population centers. 
Organizers feel ‘big hit’ 
Getting turned down for marijuana consumption and sales permits is expected to mean a substantial drop in attendance, industry insiders say. 
Attendees called High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup, held in San Bernardino in April, a “ghost town” after the city refused to sign off on the event at the last minute. 
Chalice is still slated to take place in Victorville from July 13-15, with shows by Ludacris and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on the ticket. But promoter Ryan Heil said he expects a 60 percent loss in revenue after the city said its ordinance bans cannabis sales at the event, which they said brought more than $33 million to the area last year. 
Rodriguez said he expects to make at least 50 percent less money than he’d hoped when High Life comes to National Orange Show Events Center in September, since he was forced to make it an all-ages show with no cannabis sales allowed. They’re still telling adults 21 and older that they can bring their own marijuana to consume in a “cannabis garden.”

			With the rise of legal marijuana, drug education moves from ‘don’t’ to ‘delay’		
","California legalized marijuana in 2016, and this past New Year’s Eve eager customers lined up in the darkness outside medical marijuana dispensaries across the state, ready to start shopping at the stroke of midnight. 
The effect has gone beyond the cannabis cash register. Everyone has seen the ads or heard the chatter — and that includes minors, though marijuana remains illegal for those under 21. 
“Coming out of SFO [San Francisco] airport, there are billboards for Eaze [a weed delivery service] that say ‘Marijuana is here,’” said Danielle Ramo, a psychologist who conducts research at University of California-San Francisco on adolescent drug use. “I’m not sure parents were expecting to see so many images of cannabis all over.”

But drug prevention education in schools has evolved significantly since the “Just Say No” days of the ’80s — and now typically takes an approach that’s more appropriate for the era of ubiquitous weed access. It’s one that emphasizes decision-making and critical thinking skills instead of abstinence. 
One approach is the Being Adept curriculum — an evidence-based course of study that has been used in about 20 schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.

","One in five batches of marijuana has failed laboratory testing since new state safety requirements kicked in on July 1, according to data from the California Bureau of Cannabis Control. 
Failures have been triggered by inaccurate labeling or contamination from pesticides, bacteria or processing chemicals. 
Those testing requirements and results have left some retailers with severely limited inventory over the past few weeks, as cultivators and product manufacturers scramble to get compliant products to market.

There was a big gap at the beginning of the month with the supply of marijuana buds in particular, according to Nick Rinella, chief operating officer of Verdant Distribution, a Long Beach-based independent cannabis distributor. 
The new testing requirements have also created backlogs at busy labs. 
The state has licensed just 31 testing labs, most located in Northern California, and many of them aren’t yet taking customers. As a result, Rinella said cannabis safety tests are taking between one and two weeks. 
And this week the first cannabis product was recalled from store shelves because it doesn’t meet new standards regarding pesticide levels. 
While that’s concerning, in the short term, industry experts believe it’s also a sign that California’s cannabis industry is maturing and starting to look like other regulated markets, such as alcohol and food.

California launched legal recreational marijuana sales and imposed new rules for the cannabis industry on New Years Day. But state regulators gave businesses a six-month grace period to comply with some rules, including a requirement that they could only sell products that had been tested for safety by a licensed lab. 
That grace period ended July 1, and the state says since then labs have tested 5,268 batches of marijuana, about 20 percent of which failed to meet state standards.

","Cannabis retailers soon may be able to deliver marijuana anywhere in California, no matter what city or county rules say.

All three shifts are among the new rules proposed Friday by state regulators in their long-awaited draft of permanent regulations for California’s cannabis industry. 
The permanent regulations will replace the “emergency” rules under which the multibillion-dollar industry has been operating this year. The public has 45 days to comment — in writing or at one of 10 hearings to be held soon throughout the state — on the proposed permanent cannabis rules before they’re adopted by regulators. 
This is the state’s fourth round of developing regulations for the cannabis industry. 
Rules first were drafted for the medical marijuana sector, but those had to be scrapped after Californians voted to approve recreational marijuana in November 2016. The state released its first round of emergency regulations for both sectors in November 2017, then made some changes as they extended those emergency rules this May. But the goal is to get final rules in place by the end of the year. 
“This is about seven months of listening, going to meetings and events and all of these town halls and summits, and hearing what people had to say about how the emergency regulations were working or not working,” said Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which oversees marijuana retailers, distributors, event promoters and lab testers. 
Many of the changes simply clarify the laws that regulators already laid out, Traverso explained. He said that’s true, for example, of what seems to be a big change to cannabis delivery rules. 
Emergency regulations said cities couldn’t stop marijuana delivery services from using public roads. But that was interpreted by some city attorneys to mean that even though municipalities  couldn’t prevent licensed deliveries from passing through their jurisdictions, they could ban them from actually making stops in their towns. The recommended permanent regulation — included in 136 pages of rules issued Friday by the bureau — clarifies the law this way: “A delivery employee may deliver to any jurisdiction within the State of California.” 
Interested in more coverage of the California marijuana industry? Head to TheCannifornian.com  or subscribe to The Cannifornian newsletter to get cannabis-related news, features and more. 
Given that most California cities still don’t allow retail cannabis sales, any expansion of delivery services figures to make cannabis more accessible to more people, said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association. 
The bureau’s updated rules also include tougher guidelines for cannabis advertisers and packaging. Retailers will no longer be able to promote free products, for example. And there are stricter rules about marketing products in ways that might appeal to kids. 
In its separate list — 111 pages of draft permanent rules — for companies that make marijuana products, the Department of Public Health’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch is proposing to loosen one rule that figures to benefit medical marijuana patients. 
Emergency rules say edible products must be in packages with no more than 100 total milligrams of THC, the chemical in cannabis that can make people high. The rules out Friday suggest letting patients with doctor’s recommendations for medical marijuana buy dissolving “edibles,” such as lozenges or mouth strips, that have up to 500 milligrams of THC. 
The Department of Food and Agriculture’s CalCannabis division, which oversees cultivators, also issued 68 pages of new rules that don’t include a change favored by growers. 
The department didn’t add back in a 1-acre cap on grow space per farmer. That cap was floated in state environmental documents, but dropped in emergency regulations. The California Growers Association in January sued the state over that change, saying it was needed to give small- and medium-sized growers a chance to compete in the new market. 
Many licensed retailers say they’re struggling to stay afloat. So Traverso said most of the other changes included in the rules released Friday are technical tweaks aimed at making compliance easier, including loosening a number of rules for distributors and easing a couple lab testing and labeling requirements.

That should reduce the number of products that Allen said have “unnecessarily” failed state tests undertaken since new requirements kicked in July 1.

			Cannabis leaders discuss industry future at San Jose seminar		
","Though marijuana is now legal in California, it isn’t always easy to buy and it can be especially difficult for entrepreneurs who are forced to navigate a convoluted bureaucracy to get into the industry. 
At a cannabis seminar Wednesday evening at San Jose City Hall, business leaders and government officials from around the state gathered to discuss the roadblocks the legal marijuana industry faces and, more importantly, where it’s headed. 
Lamar Thorpe and Monica Wilson, who sit on the Antioch City Council, for example, pointed out the dueling forces in their city over the legalization of marijuana. 
Interested in more coverage of the California marijuana industry? Head to TheCannifornian.com  or subscribe to The Cannifornian newsletter to get cannabis-related news, features and more. 
Though around two-thirds of the city’s residents supported legalizing marijuana when it hit the ballot last year, several members of the council have resisted allowing businesses to operate within the city. A local church group has been particularly vocal in its opposition and even local law enforcement officials have cited concerns about crime with little recent data, Thorpe said. 
“Your local Applebee’s creates more crime than cannabis,” Thorpe said, noting that the restaurant serves alcohol. 
Wilson acknowledged she originally opposed allowing marijuana to be sold in the city, but said she felt differently after learning more about the industry. 
“I really had to open my mind,” Wilson said. 
Sean Kali-rai, the founder and president of the Silicon Valley Cannabis Alliance hopes more local officials will make that same leap. And if they’re not, he’s preparing to push them toward acceptance. 
“We’re really going to start to try to push the industry,” he said. 
The former San Jose official said he’s meeting with former Obama organizer Peggy Moore and working on a political action committee. 
“We will help them figure out how to vote,” Kali-rai said, issuing what seemed to be a barely veiled threat to city officials to get on board or prepare to face a backlash. 
For now, though, despite what residents may want, many cities don’t have licensing systems in place to allow marijuana companies to operate legally. So many people are either driving long distances to buy cannabis or opting to purchase it illegally nearby. It also leaves marijuana companies scrambling to figure out the tangled web of different regulations and ordinances, with few options for where to operate. 
David Hua is the CEO of Meadow, a Y Combinator-backed software startup that aims to connect medical cannabis patients with dispensaries. But, he said, “It’s been a challenge to be a tech provider in this space.” 
Businesses find themselves playing “arbitrage,” Hua continued, urging for increased simplicity across the state. 
But reaching that point means that places like Antioch, which is still in the beginning stages of figuring out whether and how to allow legal sales, have to play catch up with places like San Jose and Sacramento, which both have licensed dispensaries and ordinances in place to regulate them. 
And it means paying workers fair wages and benefits. 
“We’re competing with In-N-Out Burger,” said Kali-rai, noting that the beloved chain pays workers more than $16 an hour in many places and predicting that the industry will have to negotiate labor peace agreements with unions in the future. 
“We’re a brand new industry,” Kali-rai said. “We can’t afford to make enemies.” 
Fiona Ma, a member of the state’s Board of Equalization and a candidate for state treasurer, thinks the state can help by creating banks to serve cannabis businesses, which right now are forced to pay taxes and fees using cash. 
Ma, who moderated a panel at the seminar, said she sees cannabis as the “largest underground economic driver” in the state. 
But, she added, so many illegal companies struggle to transition to operating legally because they can be penalize, for example, failing to pay taxes in previous years.

CARPINTERIA — This picturesque coastal town cradled by mountains and sandy shores is a scene out of a Southern California postcard. Residents of Carpinteria say they feel lucky to live in what they consider a slice of paradise. 
But change is in the air. And sometimes, they say, it stinks. 
That’s because marijuana has become a new crop of choice in the farmlands surrounding this tight-knit community of 14,000, which has long helped fuel the U.S. cut flower industry. 
Residents say a thick, skunk-like odor from the marijuana plants settles over the valley in the evenings and before dawn. To keep out the stench, they have tried stuffing pillows under doors, lighting incense and shutting windows, a reluctant choice since it also keeps out the cool ocean breezes that are part of the town’s allure. 
“We don’t want a marijuana smell,” said Xave Saragosa, a 73-year-old retired sheriff’s deputy who was born and raised in the town and lives near a greenhouse that grows marijuana. “We want fresh air.” 
Saragosa said the odor pervades his hillside home at night and keeps his wife up coughing. 
Carpinteria, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) from Los Angeles, is in the southeast corner of Santa Barbara County, a tourist area famous for its beaches, wine and temperate climate. It’s also becoming known as a haven for cannabis growers.

The county amassed the largest number of marijuana cultivation licenses in California since broad legalization arrived on Jan. 1 — about 800, according to state data compiled by The Associated Press. Two-thirds of them are in Carpinteria and Lompoc, a larger agricultural city about an hour’s drive to the northwest. 
Virtually all of Carpinteria’s licenses are for small, “mixed-light” facilities, which essentially means greenhouses. 
The result is a large number of licenses but small total acreage. Only about 200 acres of the county’s farmland is devoted to marijuana, compared with tens of thousands sown with strawberries and vegetables, said Dennis Bozanich, who oversees the county’s marijuana planning. 
The area’s greenhouses have their roots in Carpinteria’s cut flower industry, which was sapped after the U.S. government granted trade preferences to South American countries in the 1990s to encourage their farmers to grow flowers instead of coca, the plant used to make cocaine. 
In an ironic twist, some California flower growers weary of import competition have started trying to grow cannabis, a plant that, like coca, is deemed illicit by the federal government. Others have sold their greenhouses to marijuana investors. 
“We have literally no carnation production in the United States any longer because South America grows them so cheaply,” said Kasey Cronquist, chief executive of the California Cut Flower Commission. “Farmers had to move crops, and that is what we have seen happen over time — they’ve gone to crops that are more valuable or more difficult for Ecuador and Colombia to ship.” 
Domestic cut flower growers saw their share of the U.S. market drop to 27 percent in 2015 from 58 percent in 1991. Sales of imported cut flowers grew to more than $1 billion during the same period, according to data compiled by the commission. 
Greenhouses that once produced flowers are seen as ideal for marijuana. In Carpinteria’s climate, the greenhouses heat and cool easily and inexpensively, and the plants thrive. It takes only about three months to grow cannabis in pots of shredded coconut husks, so farmers can get multiple harvests each year. 
In the hills of the so-called Emerald Triangle of Northern California, where most of the state’s pot is grown, there is a single harvest each year. 
Some farmers see cannabis as a plant that can help preserve the area’s farming culture, said Mollie Culver, a consultant for the Cannabis Business Council of Santa Barbara County. Many growers live locally and welcomed the county’s recently crafted regulations requiring odor abatement, she said. 
“Santa Barbara isn’t like cannabis run amok,” said Jared Ficker, a partner at advocacy group California Strategies who consults with local cannabis growers. “It is actually the most compliant market we’ve seen in the state.” 
Some residents said the stench has decreased in recent months as some growers installed systems aimed at reducing the smells. Others said the problem persists. 
The county passed rules in February requiring growers to submit odor abatement plans and designate a representative to handle complaints. They are expected to take effect in some county areas this year and in Carpinteria following a review by state coastal regulators. 
Californians voted to legalize marijuana in 2016, but counties and cities have a say on whether they allow cannabis production, distribution or sales. 
Even before the ballot measure, Santa Barbara County recognized a number of farmers were growing marijuana to supply the state’s medical market. So officials started looking at establishing odor, security and other rules. 
“We have a lot of people who are interested in being compliant and getting into the regulated market,” Bozanich said. “If we can continue that kind of relationship where they’re going to stay in the regulated market,” it will be easier to target and eliminate black market growers, he said. 
All of the county’s licenses are to grow medical marijuana, Bozanich said, though the state allows some crossover into the adult market. 
In Carpinteria, some residents worry property values will fall if the town keeps reeking of pot. They hope the smell will fade as more growers install odor control systems and those who don’t are shut down.

Toni Stuart, an 80-year-old retired Episcopal priest, said the odor doesn’t creep into the area near the beach where she lives, but she worries about the community changing. 
“I would not like Carpinteria to be the ‘cannabis capital’ of Southern California. I like it the way it is. It’s a very quiet, unpretentious beach town,” she said. 
“If people want to grow cannabis instead of flowers or avocados or macadamia nuts — I suppose that’s their right. But they’ve got to think about their neighbors.”

			Pets not eating more marijuana in California post Prop. 64, data shows		
","Pets aren’t getting stoned more, or less, than they did before recreational cannabis became legal earlier this year in California. 
For several years, calls to animal poison control centers about pets accidentally ingesting marijuana — typically when the drug is used as an ingredient in food — have been on the rise. 
But that hasn’t changed since Jan. 1, when recreational sales became legal in California, according to new data. Overall, the percentage of calls about marijuana and pets, as a fraction of all poison center calls, has held at a relatively low level. And at least one agency says cannabis-related calls have actually dropped so far this year in California.

“Our cases have increased over the past few years, and veterinarians across the country have indicated an increase in the number of cases they are seeing,” said Dr. Tina Wismer, medical director of the Animal Poison Control Center at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
“However, when compared to chocolate or ibuprofen, the case numbers are still small.”

The ASPCA’s poison control center took 325 marijuana-related calls from California in 2017 — up from 132 in 2015. But the agency’s total volume of calls also increased during that time, with cannabis incidents consistently accounting for around one in five calls from California.

			Study: 1 in 7 Canadian cannabis users admits to high driving		
","TORONTO – With two months to go before recreational cannabis is legalized in Canada on Oct. 17, new data from the country’s national statistics agency is stoking fears about drugged driving and raising questions about the ability of law enforcement officials to detect impairment. 
According to Statistics Canada data released last week, 1 in 7 cannabis users with a valid driver’s license has hopped behind the wheel within two hours of consuming the drug at least once within the past three months.

Other surveys from Health Canada and Public Safety Canada in 2017 also revealed that large percentages of Canadians are driving after consuming marijuana. In fact, 1 in 10 respondents of the latter survey said they believed cannabis makes a person “a more careful driver” – a conviction refuted by science. 
But while Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada described the Statistics Canada numbers as “alarming,” others say the survey data tells only part of the story since it does not indicate that those who drove after smoking were actually impaired. 
Identifying marijuana impairment is a major issue that has beguiled Canadian lawmakers since the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first introduced legislation to legalize the drug in April 2017. 
Their attempt to do so is represented by Bill C-46, which overhauled Canada’s impaired driving laws. Under the legislation, drivers with two to five nanograms of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis – per milliliter of blood will face charges, which could result in hefty fines. Drivers exceeding the five-nanogram limit, or with both THC and alcohol in their systems, will face stiffer penalties, including up to 10 years in prison. 
The problem, according to Rob De Luca, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s public safety programs, is “that the link between THC levels and impairment is quite loose.” 
Cannabis is unlike alcohol, which can be easily and accurately measured by a person’s blood alcohol content levels, experts say. Cannabis metabolizes differently, and factors ranging from body fat levels to personal history with the drug to how it was ingested affect whether a driver is impaired by it. 
“Peak impairment does not occur when THC concentration in the blood is at or near peak levels,” a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report to Congress in 2017 found. “In contrast to the situation with alcohol, someone can show little or no impairment at a THC level at which someone else may show a greater degree of impairment.” 
An annex to Bill C-46 made the same point, noting, “the science is unable to provide general guidance to drivers about how much cannabis can be consumed before it is unsafe to drive or before the proposed levels would be exceeded.” 
Habitual users of the drug and those who ingest it for medicinal purposes are likely to have high THC levels days or even weeks after they last consumed marijuana and long after experiencing its psychoactive effects, De Luca said. Some studies show that even people exposed to second-hand marijuana smoke can test positive for THC. 
“There is a very real danger that someone who is not impaired will get caught up in the criminal justice system,” said De Luca, who anticipates Bill C-46 will face a barrage of legal challenges. 
Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould defended the rules earlier this year. “Until we have definitive scientific evidence around what is a safe level, we’re proceeding on a precautionary basis, saying there is no safe level,” she told the Globe and Mail. 
Bill C-46 also grants police officers with reasonable suspicion that a driver is impaired new powers to administer roadside saliva tests, which determine whether a specific drug may be present in a driver’s system. The results are not admissible in court, but failing a test will spur arrest and further examinations at a police station. 
Experts say that these tests and the devices used to carry them out are also riddled with problems. The NHTSA report found that “the accuracy and reliability of these devices has not yet been clearly established.” 
A bill that would allow police in Vermont to use roadside saliva tests failed earlier this year because of these concerns. 
Questions also have been raised about the ability of the devices, which require internal temperatures of at least 4 degrees Celsius (about 39 degrees Fahrenheit) to work, to function given Canada’s climate. A Public Safety Canada pilot study that tested some of these devices found that in 17 percent of cases where the device malfunctioned, temperature was responsible.

De Luca said the federal government should focus more on training drug-recognition experts – officers with specialized training to spot impaired drivers – than on THC limits.

62,62,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/article216979400.html,Marijuana poisoning cases in dogs on the rise | The Fresno Bee,"The legalization of recreational marijuana in Oregon brought a significant increase in pot poisoning in animals, a more serious problem than it sounds. 
Dr. Adam Stone, a veterinarian at Bend Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center, was working at a Portland animal hospital when recreational marijuana retail sales became legal. 
""We saw more cases of marijuana toxicity in the first couple months of 2016 than we had in the previous year,"" Stone, 31, said. ""There was a pretty severe increase once it was legalized recreationally."" 
Central Oregon is no exception. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
""We see anywhere from one to three in a 12-hour shift that present with signs of toxicity that could be attributed to marijuana,"" Stone said of the Emergency Clinic in Bend, where he now works. ""We usually see it solely in dogs. There's a very classic subset of signs that we see in dogs. Cats (are) not nearly as common, although sometimes it's suspected."" 
Pet Poison Helpline, a 24-hour animal poison control service, reported a 448 percent increase in marijuana cases over the past six years. 
Dr. Curt Nitschelm, a vet at the Redmond Veterinary Clinic, said ""it's definitely more frequent with the recent laws. It's usually dogs, and it's usually the edible products. From what I understand they have a higher concentration of marijuana, or the active ingredient."" 
The psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that affects pets is a cannabinoid called tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly referred to as THC. 
""Most of the cases that we see, it's been the higher concentrated products like butter, and edibles, brownies, those types of things,"" Nitschelm, 59, said. 
But it's not just baked goods and oils that can harm hounds. Dogs can get high from raw marijuana leaves and stems. While THC has to be smoked or dissolved in fat in order for human bodies to absorb it and feel its effects, dogs can simply eat part of a bud and become intoxicated. And they don't need much. 
""In rare cases, the ash from a joint can cause some dogs to react,"" Stone said. ""Someone will toss out a roach, or the end of a joint, and a dog on a hike will just snack on that. And just that little, tiny quantity — in some cases maybe a quarter of a gram, a tenth of a gram — can cause severe signs in some animals."" 
Symptoms can be frightening and unfamiliar. Nitschelm said dogs on the drug can be ""blase all the way up to non-responsive."" 
Tandi Ngwenyama, a clinical instructor of emergency and small animal critical care at Washington State University, has seen a number of marijuana toxicity cases throughout her career, especially since recreational legalization. Ngwenyama, 35, said dogs poisoned with pot have abnormal mental activity. 
""They might be a little bit more depressed or agitated; they'll walk around like they're . drunk,"" she said. ""Also pretty classic is they seem to be dribbling urine."" 
Depending on the concentration of THC consumed, affected dogs can breathe slowly and ineffectively, Ngwenyama said. They may even become comatose. 
""When we see a dog that comes in and it's lethargic, dribbling urine and having trouble standing, it's almost a sure-fire sign that the dog has gotten into marijuana,"" Stone said. 
While marijuana toxicity is not known to kill dogs, there can still be fatal complications. 
""They can get quite nauseous,"" Stone said. ""A lot of people think that you can use marijuana in dogs to treat them for nausea, and it actually causes pretty severe nausea in almost all of them. What can be life-threatening is that they get very sedate, and they can vomit and breathe in that vomit and aspirate, and get a pretty horrific pneumonia."" 
The more THC an animal consumes, the more serious the complications may be. Stone and Ngwenyama referred to cases of seizures in dogs who consumed massive quantities. 
""I've heard very rare instances of seizure activity in dogs on incredibly high doses, but we have no idea what causes that,"" Stone said. ""They could be so sedate that they stop breathing and get a seizure, or that they fall over and get head trauma and have a seizure."" 
Whether they use marijuana or not, pet owners should know the signs of toxic marijuana ingestion. Events such as concerts, fairs and festivals can be a pup's paradise for dropped treats, especially in a dog-friendly area like Central Oregon. But they can be places where pets are exposed to marijuana products. In fact, last summer's total solar eclipse and its related events produced a spike in THC poisoning at Nitschelm's Redmond clinic. 
So what to do if a dog gets high? Nitschelm and Stone advise pet owners to call their vet if it is still close to the time of ingestion, and induce vomiting according to the vet's instructions. Waiting until the full effects of THC kick in means the pet may be too sedate to safely induce vomiting. 
Once the toxin is out of the animal, take it immediately to the nearest open vet clinic. 
""The typical treatment is inducing vomiting and then you give an anti-nausea medication to keep them from vomiting overnight,"" Stone said. 
Subcutaneous fluids are often administered at the vet clinic to keep the animal hydrated. Before releasing intoxicated pets, vets advise owners not to let their pets to eat or drink until they can swallow safely unassisted. Once your pet has reached peak intoxication, prevent further consumption and give supportive care in a quiet, safe and slow environment. 
Other common toxins that vets have treated recently include drugs such as ibuprofen, which can cause liver damage, kidney damage, even brain damage, and acetaminophen, which is fatal to cats. 
Garlic, onions, grapes, raisins, dark chocolate and macadamia nuts are also toxic to dogs. 
More specific to central Oregon are salmon poisoning disease and mushroom toxicity. 
""If the fish can go to the ocean, they may potentially carry the bacteria in their blood,"" Nitschelm said. 
In dogs that have ingested toxic salmon blood, Nitschelm said, the disease could be fatal. Stone added he has seen a rise in numbers of toxic mushroom consumption. 
""We have several different types of toxic mushrooms in the area,"" he said. ""Some of them are on the rare side, but we can see liver failure happen really quickly with ingestion of a certain type of mushroom in the area."" 
More common are tremors caused by mushroom toxins, and dogs will be ""very unsteady on their feet. One of the hallmarks is that they shake uncontrollably,"" Nitschelm said. 
Keep things like medications, food, garbage, marijuana and chemicals stored safely in high places or locked cabinets. 
Nitschelm suggests getting familiar with the area before getting a pet. Learn about indoor and outdoor plants at a local garden center, read labels on products carefully before bringing them home and be cautious when cooking with ingredients that can be toxic to pets. 
If a pet may have gotten into something they shouldn't have, ""look around, see exactly what it is,"" Ngwenyama said. ""Look at the packaging so they can give (the vet) details, like what's the active ingredient and how much they ingested.""

Or so I thought. 
""I want to start growing marijuana,"" my father declared during one of our weekly Skype chats. 
Wait, what? Hang on a minute. You want to grow pot? Why? 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
""It's legal,"" he replied, ""and I want to grow the plant."" 
Dad is 78 years old and more square than a Saltine cracker. While attending college in the Bay Area during the '60s, he was as far removed from hippies and the counterculture movement as someone his age could possibly be. How far removed? 
The other day he sent a group text to my sister and I. It read: 
""Who was Pink Floyd and how come I don't know anything about it? Did Mom know?"" 
Needless to say, we both got a good laugh out of that one. 
I will say my father's interest in horticulture didn't just suddenly germinate. His front and back yards are filled with plants and flowers. He even has a room devoted to indoor orchids where fluorescent grow lights hum all hours of the day. 
So in that context, marijuana is just another plant. A plant whose stigma is withering on the vine. 
Well, at least in most places. 
I thought about this recently while following the Fresno City Council debate over whether to place a business license tax for marijuana dispensaries on the November ballot. Never mind that California voters legalized medicinal marijuana way back in 1996. Never mind that starting Jan. 1, California became one of nine states to legalize recreational sales and use. 
Why is Fresno so far behind, so stuck in puritanical thinking? 
Because there are people in this community who wish to propagate the marijuana stigma, who use their platforms to accuse and demonize. 
People like Councilman Steve Brandau, who had the impudence to ask a cannabis dispensary owner who spoke during public comment if he smoked pot. As if that's any of Brandau's business. 
If that same person was applying for an alcohol license, Brandau would have never dreamed of asking if he drank. You can bet a three-martini lunch on that. 
People like Pastor Elias Loera from Christian Temple Fresno, who is so incensed the city approved seven medicinal dispensaries that he threatened to ""make sure 100,000"" people knew how each council member voted. 
The Fresno City Council voted Thursday, June 14, 2018 to put a cannabis business tax license measure on the November ballot. 
Loera is certainly welcome to his views, but all he's doing is perpetuating the stigma against members of his own parish. Because of those 100,000 people he's supposedly wagging his finger on behalf of, more than half (52 percent) have smoked marijuana at least once and 44 percent do so currently. Those were the results of a nationwide Marist poll from 2017. 
The poll also found that 83 percent of Americans aged 18 and over support medical marijuana, 49 percent support recreational marijuana (47 percent were opposed) and 56 percent said using marijuana is ""socially acceptable."" 
Just as revealing, 70 percent of those polled said marijuana is less risky than alcohol and 76 percent said it's less risky than tobacco. 
That burning sound you hear are those old stereotypes going up in smoke. 
Public opinion and societal acceptance have moved so quickly that even lawmakers have shifted their stance. None more so than former Speaker of the House John Boehner, who has gone from prohibitionist to profiteer by joining the advisory board of Acreage Holdings, which cultivates and sells marijuana in 11 states. 
""Over the last 10 or 15 years, the American people's attitudes have changed dramatically,"" Boehner told Bloomberg News. ""I find myself in that same position."" 
Even President Trump recently stated that he ""probably"" would support legislation protecting legal cannabis businesses in states where it has won voter approval. He has also declared the Justice Department would not enforce a previous threat to crack-down on recreational marijuana in those same states. 
It feels like only a matter of time until Congress acts to remove marijuana from the federal list of Class 1 drugs. 
As I've written previously, don't mistake this as a marijuana endorsement. I wouldn't recommend anyone smoke pot – just as I wouldn't recommend anyone drink whiskey, smoke cigarettes or consume deep-fried Twinkies. All are probably best avoided. 
It's just that tobacco, alcohol and trans fats have not been demonized and stigmatized. But social mores aren't what they used to be. My dad is living proof. 
Next time I visit, guess I shouldn't be surprised if there's a certain odor in the air and he's listening to ""Dark Side of the Moon.""

64,64,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/pot-in-california/article214031499.html,"Second time not a charm. Appellate court says Fresno County can't fine pot grower $99,000 | The Fresno Bee","Three years ago, a Superior Court judge criticized Fresno County’s medical marijuana cultivation ban, ruling that a $99,000 fine could not be imposed on a Laton man who got rid of his plants before sheriff's deputies could cite him. 
Undeterred, lawyers hired by the county appealed Judge Dale Ikeda's ruling. 
On Thursday, the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno sided with Ikeda, saying the $99,000 fine against Xiongh Thao could not be imposed. 
""Mindboggling,"" Fresno attorney Brenda Linder said of the county's insistence on spending taxpayer money on an ordinance that two judges have now ruled lacks due process. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
Linder represents Thao, who was growing 99 medical marijuana plants on his property in Laton when sheriff's deputies showed up on March 3, 2014, saw the marijuana plants, and advised him that as of Feb. 7, 2014, it was illegal for anyone to grow or cultivate marijuana in the county. 
""The deputies then left the property and Thao immediately removed and destroyed the plants,"" the appellate ruling says. 
Three days later, sheriff's deputies returned to Thao's property and served him with a citation even though his plants were destroyed, the appellate ruling says. The Fresno County Board of Supervisors later fined Thao $1,000 per plant under the county ordinance, which the Board of Supervisors adopted in January 2014. 
In his ruling in June 2015, Ikeda said Thao should not have been fined, saying the county's ordinance allows 15 days for removal of the plants. 
In its appeal, the county argued that the fines ""are intended to punish the violators whether or not the nuisance is abated within a reasonable time."" The county also said the $1,000 per plant penalty is determined on the date of the inspection and ""can be imposed regardless of when the nuisance was abated."" 
But the appellate court said the state's Government Code required the county to give Thao ""a reasonable time to abate the nuisance before imposing the fine."" Further, the justices said, the citation given to Thao ""clearly stated he had 15 days to abate the nuisance before penalties would be imposed and that the penalties would be assessed only if Thao failed to take action to cure the violation."" 
In addition, the county argued the fine was justified because Thao's plants were an ""immediate threat to public safety."" But the appellate court noted that the deputies went to Thao's property, saw the plants and left. ""This apparent lack of urgency is inconsistent with an immediate threat to public health and safety,"" the ruling says. ""If the deputies considered the threat immediate, they could have summarily abated the nuisance."" 
Budtender Danny Cress gives a crash course in recreational marijuana, legal in California as of Jan. 1. 
The county's spokesman, Jordan Scott, said county officials ""respectfully disagree"" with the appellate ruling. Scott said the county has not decided whether to appeal the ruling by Presiding Justice Brad Hill and Justices Herbert Levy and Jennifer Detjen. 
Scott noted the the ruling only applies to Thao's case and the county has since amended its ordinance. 
""The ruling does not have implications for how the administrative fines under county ordinances are to be assessed,"" Scott said. The appellate ruling also does not overturn any existing ban under the county's medical marijuana ordinance, Scott said.

65,65,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article213195949.html,Should Fresno tax marijuana operations? Voters to decide in November | The Fresno Bee,"The Fresno City Council on Thursday voted to put a cannabis business license tax measure on the November ballot. 
After hearing pleas both from pastors against allowing medicinal marijuana and from cannabis patients, the council voted 5-1 to approve the resolution. 
District 2 Councilman Steve Brandau voted against it because he said it opened up the possibility for future councils to profit from and allow recreational marijuana. 
He first moved to include a caveat to tax only medicinal operations but received no support. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
Councilman Garry Bredefeld was absent. 
Before the vote, District 7 Councilman Clint Olivier, who has been a strong supporter of legalizing cannabis, said Fresno went from being behind on marijuana regulations to being ahead. 
""Let’s face it, the city of Fresno is pioneering something,"" he said. ""The city of Fresno is leading the way. It’s on the cutting edge."" 
The measure will require two-thirds voter approval. 
The tax will collect up to 10 percent on receipts and up to $12 per canopy square foot (a term used to measure a cultivation site's size). The city estimates the tax could bring in up to $10 million. Ninety percent of the revenue will be used for services such as police, fire, roads and parks. The other 10 percent will go into a community benefit fund, and a special citizens commission will determine the priorities of that money. 
If the 10 percent tax ends up being too high, the council can lower it. However, the council cannot raise the tax above 10 percent without another ballot measure. 
Pastor Elias ""Eli"" Loera from Christian Temple Fresno said the city doesn't need dispensaries if people can grow six plants inside their home, which produces enough cannabis to ""chain smoke,"" he said. 
""People are going to know here, what you voted, and I'm going to make sure 100,000 of them know,"" he said to the council. 
Susan Juvet, a Fresno resident and cannabis patient, addressed the council while wearing a green baseball cap with a marijuana leaf on it. She told them medicinal marijuana helped her to stop taking benzodiazepines to manage her pain. 
""It's still embarrassing to get up here and talk about this, so I really look forward to the day when I don't have to come down here and do this,"" she said. Cannabis ""changed my life dramatically. It saved my marriage. ... Those drugs that the doctor had me on were terrible. They made me angry and agitated. They didn't help my pain. They didn't help my anxiety. They made things worse."" 
Mayor Lee Brand said although he voted against Proposition 64, he had to set his personal feelings aside on this issue. He reassured opponents that the city was not trying to make money off marijuana. He said that's where other cities that have allowed marijuana made mistakes. His goal is to ""cripple"" the black market by controlling accessibility and affordability. And, the councilmembers did their due diligence in researching best and worst practices. 
""One of the biggest problems in this city is drugs and gangs,"" he said. ""...You could characterize Fresno as 'Drugs, Incorporated.' We need to tackle the citywide issue that's devastating our community."" 
Even Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer weighed in on the discussion, saying he supports having a limited number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city. Dyer said there's 70 illegal dispensaries operating in the city, but the police department doesn't have the resources or community support to shut them down. 
""I do believe that we can eliminate illegal dispensaries in our community,"" he said. ""I believe that with all my heart."" 
The council has yet to approve a regulatory ordinance outlining what kind and how many marijuana operations will be allowed. Later in Thursday's meeting, City Attorney Doug Sloan gave a presentation on what city officials are considering including in the ordinance. 
The city may move to allow one medical marijuana dispensary in each council district. After one year, the council will evaluate the progress and will have the option to allow an additional dispensary in each district. 
The ordinance would allow for four business hubs which could be located within one mile of Highway 180 or Highway 99 or near the city's wastewater treatment plant. The hubs could not be near a residential zone, school, daycare center or youth center, such as a park. 
All cultivation, distribution and manufacturing done in the city must be within a hub. 
Lab testing would be allowed within a hub or a commercial, downtown or employment district. 
Business license applications would go through the city manager's office and need to be renewed each year. 
District 1 Councilman Oliver Baines said he hopes to organize educational community meetings, and he hopes the draft ordinance will be released within one or two months.

But they do anyway | The Fresno Bee,"California recreational marijuana dispensaries are collecting customers' personal information – including government identification documents as well as what products they buy – even though the record keeping is not part of Proposition 64, the state law voters approved in November 2016. 
Collection of the data raises concerns for some because it remains unclear how the federal government intends to respond to marijuana legalization, since the herb remains a controlled substance in U.S. statutes. 
In contrast, Colorado and Oregon, states that also have legalized recreational use, banned collection of personal information. And officials in Washington, another state with legal weed, said building customer databases is not practiced there. 
In addition to concerns about privacy and identity theft, the data collection also has caught the attention of Second Amendment proponents, because marijuana use by firearm owners is prohibited under federal law. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
A check of vendors closest to Fresno County (which has no recreational marijuana outlets) found none where a customer profile was not kept on dispensary computers. That includes an outlet in Woodlake in Tulare County as well as dispensaries in Stanislaus County, Salinas, Santa Cruz, Sacramento and the Bay Area. 
When asked why customer profiles were created, several dispensary workers incorrectly stated the information was required under Proposition 64. Others cited it as a customer convenience. All said a customer who did not agree to the terms would be turned away. None of those queried would agree to provide a last name to a Fresno Bee reporter. 
In Woodlake, a man who identified himself as the manager of Valley Pure, the first recreational dispensary in Tulare County, cited state law for the data collection. He would not identify himself and said inquiries about the data collection constituted ""harrassment."" 
Jason Finfrock, the reported owner of Valley Pure, said Thursday that he would have no comment on the issue. 
At the Green Door in San Francisco, an employee said, ""We will only ring you up if you come up on our profile."" 
At Canna Cruz in Santa Cruz, a man who gave his first name as Ian said the information was required by law and added, ""if a person didn't want to do that, we would suggest they not shop at our dispensary."" 
Similar responses came from workers at Flavors, in the Stanislaus County town of Riverbank, at People's Remedy in Modesto and Alpine Alternatives in Sacramento. 
Proposition 64 establishes one ounce of marijuana, or 8 grams of cannabis concentrates, as the legal limit for recreational pot possession for adults over the age of 21. Here are examples of actual amounts of products someone could carry now that 
Said Alex Traverso, chief of communications for California's Bureau of Cannabis Control: 
""The state doesn't require that retail locations collect the personal information of customers. In our regulations, it says nothing of the sort."" 
In comparison, under Colorado Amendment 64, requirements for a marijuana purchase requires nothing ""other than information typically acquired ... in a ... transaction at a retail liquor store."" 
Oregon's state law, enacted in 2017, is more direct. It bans data collection and orders that any information collected by vendors be destroyed within 30 days. 
Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesman for Washington's Liquor and Cannabis Board, said there is no requirement for data collection in his state. 
""If you walk in, they may card you,"" as at a liquor store, he said. 
Fresno attorney Brenda Linder, who has represented medical marijuana dispensaries, said the recreational outlets ""are probably taking more information than they need."" She added that it may be that dispensaries are taking information needed for sales of medical marijuana. 
""It's a holdover from that model,"" she said. ""They are having a hard time shifting over (to recreational marijuana sales)."" 
Linder said it remains unclear how U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a foe of legal marijuana, will respond in the future to legalization of pot by states, and noted that firearms buyers who consume marijuana should be cautious. 
""You either have to not possess (a gun) or make a horrible decision to lie on a firearms application,"" she said. 
In 2011, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms notified gun dealers that marijuana users were prohibited from buying firearms. 
In 2016, the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a district court ruling that a marijuana user in Nevada had no Second Amendment right to own a firearm. 
In December, police in Honolulu gave gun owners who are registered as medical marijuana users 30 days to turn in their firearms, a move the chief later rescinded. 
Brandon Combs, an attorney with the Firearms Policy Coalition, said firearms possession while being a marijuana user continues to have ""very serious consequences."" He scoffed at assertions by dispensaries that their data was private and would not be shared with anyone. 
""If they are raided by federal authorities, and that (data) is seized, there could be real problem,"" for those in such a database, Combs said. ""It raises massive concerns.""

67,67,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article212782749.html,Fresno pastors express staunch opposition to city's draft marijuana rules | The Fresno Bee,"A group of local pastors is angry and concerned about legislation being drafted that would pave the growth of medicinal marijuana dispensaries and manufacturing plants in the city of Fresno. 
The pastors — Paul L. Binion II of Westside Church of God, B.T. Lewis II of Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church and Elias Loera of Christian Temple Fresno — learned new details about the work-in-progress legislation during an advisory committee meeting with Mayor Lee Brand this week. They staunchly oppose the proposal. 
It calls for allowing seven medical marijuana dispensaries in the city — one in each council district — and four manufacturing facilities where cannabis will be cultivated, tested, processed and packaged. After one year, seven additional dispensaries may be allowed to operate. 
The mayor and his staff confirmed those proposals are being discussed, but the regulatory ordinance on cannabis likely won't go to a vote until late summer or early fall. By then, the regulatory details in the ordinance may change. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
The ordinance will be discussed at the June 14 city council meeting in a workshop format. No decisions will be made and few details were made public, but an action item on the agenda does call for the council to vote on a possible marijuana business license tax ballot measure for November. To meet certain timelines, the council must vote soon whether or not they want businesses to be taxed if they're going to be allowed. 
Last year, a divided city council voted to ban recreational marijuana in the city but unanimously voted to rewrite the city's ordinance on medical cannabis. 
Now the mayor says regulating marijuana deters the black market. 
The pastors doubt that claim. They said they believe the dispensaries will increase access to marijuana for teens, calling it a ""gateway"" drug. They also believe the city is motivated by dollar signs, and ""all money is not good money."" 
Lewis quoted Jeremiah 29:7 from the Bible, which reads, in part: ""Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile."" He also quoted Isaiah 1:17: ""Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow."" 
The pastors' opposition to legal cannabis is their way of seeking justice and defending the oppressed, he said. 
""It's a spiritual issue with me, but it's a moral issue that our leadership in our city would compromise the health and welfare of our community so they can get more money in the coffers,"" Binion said. ""I'm greatly disturbed. 
""As I told the mayor, you don't deal with what I'm dealing with. You don't deal with families coming to me ...'Pastor help us, my son, or my daddy smoked the grocery money."" 
Loera said he arrives every morning to his church, near Cedar and Belmont avenues in southeast Fresno, and sees homeless people who are high wandering the streets ""dazed and confused."" He always assumed they were drunk, until he realized marijuana is cheaper to buy on the street than a 40-ounce beer at the liquor store. 
Learn about the brain reward system and the biochemical processes that occur during marijuana use. 
Lewis said the pastors aren't interested in compromise. ""It's about standing up for what we believe to be morally and spiritually right for our community."" 
Now, the pastors are working on a strategy for their response. They're expecting dozens of pastors to show up for a meeting this month to discuss the issue, and they'll be urging their congregations to write letters and make phone calls to their council members. 
The mayor said his main focus is addressing the drug problem in Fresno and serving the best interest of Fresnans. ""The motive is not to make money and haphazardly put things together,"" he said. ""Doing nothing is not the answer."" 
The city will use resources and money combating illegal operations, he said, when it could be making money by taxing and strictly regulating legal businesses. 
Brand said he sympathizes with the religious leaders who are standing their spiritual and moral ground, but he said he's thinking about what's best for Fresno, not his personal philosophies on the problem. 
There are well-paying jobs in the medical marijuana industry in the 29 states where it is legal. Here are estimated salaries for jobs in cultivation and production. 
Some local pastors do support legalizing medical marijuana. Rev. Ara Guekguezian of the Big Red Church in the Fresno High neighborhood said it's no different than alcohol. 
""I don’t see it as a moral issue whatsoever,"" he said. ""It's just like drinking one or two glasses of wine — it's not an issue. But when you're drinking two bottles of wine is when it becomes a problem. It comes down to personal responsibility."" 
Guekguezian said marijuana laws have exploited the poor and people of color at a disproportionate rate, and legalizing marijuana allows city leaders to have more control over it. 
Councilmembers Steve Brandau and Garry Bredefeld already have expressed hesitation to the proposal. 
Brandau said the number of proposed dispensaries makes him wary. ""I don’t believe we need a ton of them (dispensaries) in the city of Fresno,"" he said. ""I was open-minded to a couple of them, which was the original discussion that we ended up having at the last vote. Behind the scenes, that number has expanded beyond my comfort level."" 
Brandau said he will go into the June 14 workshop with an open mind before he makes his decision. 
Bredefeld said, ""Do not be fooled: This is about the city of Fresno getting into the marijuana business and industry. It's no longer about just providing medicinal marijuana to some people who need it."" 
The idea that regulating marijuana would reduce the black market was ""ridiculous"" and ""absurd,"" he said. He also expressed frustration that already the state of California is discussing decreasing taxes on the cannabis industry, but not other businesses in the state. 
""I agree with the religious leaders in our community, and many other leaders in the community, who believe this is not what the city of Fresno should be involved in,"" he said. ""It's a misguided policy by those seeking to profit off of drugs. It's unfortunate there's local elected leaders who support this."" 
Both Brandau and Bredefeld said that doesn't mean they'll vote against the tax resolution at the next meeting. 
That resolution is sponsored by Councilmembers Oliver Baines, Paul Caprioglio and Clint Olivier. 
The resolution text says the tax could generate anywhere between $3 million to $10 million annually for the city's general fund. The money would be used for services such as police, fire roads and parks. Ten percent of the funds would be placed in a community benefit fund to be allocated by a special citizens commission.

68,68,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/pot-in-california/article191681054.html,Here’s where to buy legal pot in the Valley after Jan. 1 – and how it will work | The Fresno Bee,"For the first time in more than 100 years, it will be legal in California to buy marijuana for recreational use. But that doesn’t mean it will be easy to find – especially if you live in the central San Joaquin Valley. 
State licenses for recreational sales will kick in on New Year’s Day. Legal pot shops are expected to open their doors on that day in a few cities, such as San Diego and Berkeley, but most California local governments are still either wrestling with their consciences on marijuana or working to get their rules in order. 
Many Valley cities have moved to ban recreational sales, including Fresno and Clovis, but two small towns each about an hour’s drive from Fresno have approved dispensaries and made some progress in attracting them. 
Coalinga, the first local city to approve allowing cannabis operations, is still looking for suitors to open its first dispensary. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
But Woodlake – a town of less than 8,000 people about 15 miles northeast of Visalia in Tulare County – has pushed forward at breakneck speed, going from idea to ordinance to the approval of two companies’ dispensary proposals in less than six months. City leaders hope to unlock a treasure trove of tax revenue, which can be used to beef up a thinning public service budget, and attract customers to a blip on the map found well off the beaten path. 
Michael Dunaway is the president and founder of Green Bean Pharm, one of the two companies looking to move into Woodlake. Green Bean has operated as a medical cannabis delivery service in Tulare County since 2013. Dunaway and his partners bought the shuttered former home of High Sierra Lumber & Supply on Naranjo Boulevard, the city’s main east-west street,, and are in the middle of a massive remodeling project. They plan to turn one section of the lot into a marijuana storefront, then work to attract other cannabis-related tenants to form a sort-of pot business park. 
“This area, the Valley, is conservative and shy in terms of cannabis,” Dunaway said. “And for years, people only had access to low-quality, black-market cannabis that is well below state standards. We’re working to educate people on cannabis and raise the bar in Tulare County.” 
But to do that, Dunaway’s company, which he said delivered to 1,300 to 1,500 customers in the last year, still has to clear a few hurdles. 
Local approval is required to advance through the state’s cannabis licensing procedures. Woodlake gave it at the end of November, leaving Dunaway precious little time to get his state paperwork in order. Turning a lumber yard into a pot shop is also no easy task, especially given the various state and local safety requirements – surveillance cameras, controlled access, secure display cases, and so on. The city of Woodlake also has the right to deny final approval if any of these or other guidelines (for example, employee background checks and fee payments) aren’t met. 
It’s no surprise, then, that Green Bean won’t be ready on Jan. 1. Dunaway hopes to open by the end of February. 
Although his location is still under construction, Dunaway has a pretty good feel for how what will be the central San Joaquin Valley’s first recreational dispensary will work. 
Customers will be required to show identification to a receptionist to enter the building. Once inside, the receptionist will ask customers exactly what they’re looking for. 
Green Bean will offer novice buyers a consultation with a “senior budtender,” who will ask about what sort of effects the customer is looking for and offer recommendations. The employee will explain the differences between indica vs. sativa or tinctures vs. extracts, and can answer various other pot-related questions. 
Proposition 64 establishes one ounce of marijuana, or 8 grams of cannabis concentrates, as the legal limit for recreational pot possession for adults over the age of 21. 
Seasoned cannabis consumers are welcome to skip this consultation and wait in the lobby for their turn to enter the sales area. 
Customers will be escorted at all times while in the sales area. State law prohibits prospective buyers from touching the cannabis inside the shop, but Dunaway said they will be allowed to smell it and inspect it closely. All purchases will be sealed in the opaque, state-mandated packaging that will also display a receipt and tracking information. 
Buyers will then leave through a separate exit, as security provisions require that no one enters and exits through the same door. 
“We’re looking to maximize security with limited invasion,” Dunaway said. “We didn’t want it to feel like a prison. We wanted an open, welcoming space – something a soccer mom would be comfortable going inside.” 
We didn’t want it to feel like a prison. We wanted an open, welcoming space – something a soccer mom would be comfortable going inside. 
Green Bean Pharm founder Michael Dunaway 
Green Bean currently employs seven people, and Dunaway hopes to hire five or six more once his store opens. 
Dunaway hopes his dispensary will attract a new clientele: Those curious about marijuana who have been scared away by criminality or the plant’s dubious black market sales structure. These are baby boomers who may have tried pot a few times in high school, retirees who find themselves flush with cash and free time or college students who’ve recently turned 21 – the minimum age for cannabis use in California. 
Price is a difficult thing to nail down, Dunaway said. He currently pays California business taxes, but legalization has brought a slew of fees and taxes that are still in flux. 
He currently sells an ounce of top-shelf marijuana for $300. About $20 of that covers his delivery costs, so that ounce would sell in his store for $280. 
However, Green Bean will have to account for a mandatory 15 percent state excise tax on all product he buys wholesale. This means that for every $1,000 he spends buying cannabis, he will have to immediately pay $150 to the state. State law bans businesses from holding both a cultivation and dispensary license in most scenarios, so Dunaway will have to purchase his product. 
Recreational store sales will also be subject to state sales tax of around 8 percent, as well as any local sales tax. Woodlake plans to impose a sales tax of up to 10 percent. Medical cannabis patients can exempt themselves from paying sales tax if they register with the state. 
The business will also be required to pay thousands in fees and to cover a special marijuana property tax that many cities, including Coalinga and Woodlake, have adopted. 
Market factors may also play a role. Legal cultivators will likely charge more, as the demand for marijuana will likely outstrip the supply until the legal cannabis industry expands. When Nevada legalized marijuana earlier this year, for example, the state’s 47 dispensaries quickly depleted the legal cannabis supply. It remains illegal in both state and federal jurisdictions to transfer marijuana across state lines. 
These factors will all tie into Dunaway’s final prices – meaning that $300 high-quality ounce could sell for $400 or more in February. However, that price should decrease as the supply of legal marijuana increases in the next year or two, Dunaway said. 
45 percentAccording to credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, California cannabis businesses could face a taxation rate of up to 45 percent. 
This is not unique to Green Bean or Woodlake. Fitch Ratings predicted that cannabis companies in the not-always-business-friendly Golden State could face taxation rates of up to 45 percent, and an Associated Press report found that pot prices could rise as much as 70 percent when going from black market to legal purchases. 
The new state rules also prohibit dispensaries from giving away free cannabis – a tactic used frequently by pot companies to maintain customer loyalty. It’s typical for medical delivery services to offer pre-rolled joints or a pot brownie as a sweetener for any purchase over a certain amount. 
This hurts quite a bit, Dunaway said, as it is yet another leg up for his black-market competitors. 
Like many current cannabis operators, Green Bean works with industry representatives who lobby in Sacramento to follow changes in the law and, on occasion, ask for certain rules such as this one to be relaxed. 
Dunaway is determined to make the best of it, though, saying he’s currently exploring promotional giveaways of non-cannabis items – shirts, hats, lighters – as a way to keep people coming back. 
Some sort of cannabis-related business seems likely to spread to Mendota and Firebaugh. Like Coalinga, these westside towns have an agricultural background and face significant economic hurdles due to their high poverty rate. Whether these cities will allow dispensaries – which have tended to scare local municipalities due to the perceived risk of crime and the idea of money and marijuana actually changing hands – remains to be seen. 
Hanford is moving forward with various commercial cannabis growing projects, but its city government has taken a hard line against dispensaries. 
And then there’s Fresno. 
Of California’s five largest cities, Fresno is the only one to have installed a clear ban on recreational cannabis sales. The city’s voters narrowly approved Proposition 64, which legalized recreational sales and use for adults 21 and over. After several months of contentious debate, the Fresno City Council passed the ban by a 4-3 vote in August. Residents can still grow their own marijuana under Proposition 64, however, which supersedes city ordinances. 
On Dec. 14, however, the city council voted to begin an overhaul on the August ban and allow businesses to begin applying for a state license while Fresno works out its final rules. The city will also begin issuing letters to medical cannabis businesses. 
This back-and-forth will likely take months to shake out, as arguments between council members have spilled onto social media and carried on for the better part of a year. And several council seats will change hands in November, which could prompt the council to again revisit the contentious issue. 
For now, anyway, Fresno residents should plan for a one-hour road trip to buy legal weed.

What is coming with new law 
Recreational marijuana sales will become legal on New Year’s Day. Here is the difference between medical and recreational use: 
Medical: Has been legal since 1996. Must have a doctor’s recommendation. Can only buy from licensed dispensaries and delivery services. 
Recreational: Becomes legal to buy recreational cannabis on Monday. Purchases must be made at state-licensed operations. The closest one to Fresno will be Woodlake’s Green Bean Pharm, which hopes to open in February.

69,69,CA,www.fresnobee.com,https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article214406254.html,"As Fresno wrestles with pot, the end of Prohibition offers lessons | The Fresno Bee","In July 1933 Fresno was a town of just over 50,000, and like most American cities, was struggling under the weight of the Great Depression. To ease the burdens of daily living, the common man turned to an illegal substance – alcohol. 
Prohibition was still the law of the land and it had supporters, but the tide of public opinion had strongly turned against it. That year the Fresno Bee regularly editorialized in favor of repealing the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act, which established Prohibition. A typical question of the day was: Are you dry (in favor of Prohibition) or wet (in favor of repeal)? 
Today, Fresno is 10 times larger and the jobless rate is near the lowest it has been in a decade. But city leaders have been wrestling with the best way to legalize a substance of a different kind: marijuana. 
Last month the Fresno City Council decided to put a tax measure on the November ballot for voters to decide. If approved, the city could issue business licenses to those who want to start medical marijuana dispensaries. 
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. 
Medical use of marijuana has been legal in California since 1996, and in 2016 the state’s voters widely backed recreational use of pot. But cities have the authority to license dispensaries and manufacturing hubs within their limits. 
In many ways, the debate leading up to the council’s vote last month mirrored the tenor of the Prohibition debate in 1933. And there are lessons from that time that can prove useful as the city moves forward with its ballot measure. 
The will of the people in 1933 led states toward repealing Prohibition. The Bee supported such an effort as well, as it said Prohibition violated the liberty of the citizens of that era. Eighty-five years later, California’s voters have made clear they want to be able to use marijuana as they wish. Two years ago the recreational use of marijuana was approved, and even the majority of voters in Fresno – 51.4 percent – backed the right to smoke pot for recreation. Today, Mayor Lee Brand is backing medical marijuana, but not any recreational use. If two-thirds of Fresno voters approve the tax measure, Fresno will become the third major city in the San Joaquin Valley to allow medical dispensaries (Modesto and Merced already do). 
During the Prohibition debate The Bee pointed out that crime took off when alcohol became illegal. Speakeasies and bootleggers proliferated. Today, Brand and Police Chief Jerry Dyer say licensing medical marijuana dispensaries will attack illegal dealing. By setting up legal, city-licensed dispensaries for medical purposes, Brand aims to put illegal operations out of business. 
Revenues raised from the licensing tax – estimated at between $3 million and $10 million – would go to police efforts to curb illegal drugs, Brand pledges, though the tax measure is still being finalized. Here is where caution is sounded from a Bee editorial in March 1933: “For unless beer is relatively cheap to the consumer, it will not drive out the bootlegger. Good beer at a fair price will be preferred by most people to illicit beer at about an equal price. But if because of excessive license fees and state taxation legal beer comes on the market at a price greatly in excess of current speakeasy quotations, the bootlegger will simply continue to flourish.” 
Morality then and now divided Fresno’s pastors. A group of ministers recently implored the council to not allow medical pot dispensaries. Doing so would signal city endorsement of the use of marijuana and other drugs, which already ravages their communities, the pastors said. But other ministers expressed the value in letting residents suffering from pain find relief by utilizing pot under medical care. 
In January 1933 the Rev. A.C. Douglas stopped in Fresno to give a speech on Prohibition and the temperance movement to a gathering at the Hotel Fresno. A former leader in the Iowa-Kansas Anti-Saloon League, Douglas told his listeners how he had spent decades studying the temperance movement. His conclusion: “No regulatory measures ever devised – including that of the United States Government – has ever been able to curb successfully the age-old social custom of drinking.” 
That government control came to an end on Dec. 5, 1933, when Utah ratified the 21st Amendment. With that, two-thirds of states had backed the measure to repeal Prohibition, meaning Americans could once again drink freely. But that right came with responsibility that was not always followed. The same issue of The Bee that declared the end of Prohibition also reported how a leading Fresno citizen, grape grower Lucius Powers, had been killed the day before in a car crash in Fowler caused by a wrong-way driver. The next day The Bee reported the wrong-way driver told police he was intoxicated. 
“There is nothing new about this, unfortunately,” The Bee said in an editorial published after the crash. “There was drunken driving before prohibition. There was drunken driving all during the nearly 14 years of prohibition. Undoubtedly there will be drunken driving now that prohibition has been repealed.” 
That unfortunate reality also holds for marijuana – and any substance people chose to use. The mayor is right to say each person ultimately determines if he or she will be a responsible citizen. 
That said, the tax measure goes to voters in the fall. May they keep the lessons of the Prohibition era in mind when they cast their votes in the November election. The Bee will offer its recommendation as the election gets closer. As of now, The Bee – as it did 85 years ago – sees value in honoring the will of the people, of reducing drug-related crime, and letting residents make personal choices in liberty.

			Eight face charges after Murrieta police find illegal marijuana grows		
","Seven men and a woman are accused of illegally operating multiple indoor marijuana grows in Murrieta. 
Jing Li, 37, Xue Geng Tang, 41, Shan Ye, 41, Huang Zi Zhang, 63, Lai Zi Zhang, 49, Sheng Zhong Zhang, 65, Tian Zhang, 43, and Xiuxia Zhu, 38, were arrested Friday afternoon following a Murrieta police investigation that began last month and were ordered to appear for arraignments. 
The Chinese immigrants are all charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana, transportation of marijuana for sale, grand theft and utilities theft. 
Each defendant was being held in lieu of $210,000 bail on Wednesday. 
According to Murrieta police Lt. Mark Reid, the agency’s Special Enforcement Team became aware of alleged illicit commercial cannabis activity at three separate residences and gathered sufficient evidence to obtain search warrants for each location. 
The first warrant was served on Aug. 2 and led to the seizure of 2,800 marijuana plants, as well as evidence that electrical circuitry had been re- routed, resulting in utilities losses of $46,000, Reid said. 
He said two other properties — a house on Cardiff Road and a house on Raphael Drive — were targeted by investigators last Friday. 
“Inside each of the locations, the team located large illegal marijuana grows and the theft of electricity,” the lieutenant said. 
According to Reid, there were indications that an electrical fire had erupted in the garage of one home, but it had been extinguished before causing significant damage. 
A total 7,000 cannabis plants in various stages of growth were seized by investigators, according to Reid, who said the estimated total loss stemming from the alleged utilities theft was $200,000. 
The defendants were taken into custody at the residences without incident. None have documented prior felony convictions in Riverside County.

			Riverside permanently bans marijuana dispensaries, outdoor growing		
","No marijuana dispensaries, no commercial marijuana cultivation and no outdoor growing of marijuana will be allowed in Riverside, the City Council decided Tuesday, July 10. 
The permanent ban is set to go into effect Aug. 24, about two weeks before the city’s temporary moratorium with similar prohibitions expires. 
The 4-3 vote still allows people to use marijuana and to grow up to six plants indoors. California voters decided through Proposition 64, which went into effect in January, that those uses couldn’t be banned. Voters in six of Riverside’s seven wards voted in favor of the state law. 
Riverside, though, now bans almost everything marijuana-related that state law allows it to ban. One exception is that cannabis testing will continue to be permitted. 
Previously, the city allowed four marijuana plants outside and four more inside, if they were for personal use. 
The council’s two-hour debate came after several workshops beginning more than a year ago. Most recently, in March, the council heard a report from Denver police officers and a delegation of Riverside officials who traveled to the Colorado capital to study the effects of marijuana legalization there. 
Councilmen Mike Gardner, Andy Melendrez and Mike Soubirous voted against the ban Tuesday. They voted instead for a motion that would have allowed the city to create a new moratorium while it studied the effects of legalization in nearby cities such as Moreno Valley as well as Oregon and Washington. In March, the Moreno Valley City Council voted to approve 27 commercial pot enterprises — eight of them dispensaries. 
Riverside City Councilman Chuck Conder, whose ward voted against Proposition 64, said the ban would allow residents who need medical marijuana to get it from other cities, while limiting the crime he associated with marijuana. 
“The cost of doing this is not worth the soul of Riverside,” he said. “If they want to go somewhere else to do it, then go.” 
In March, officials presented a grim picture of Denver’s legalization, with dramatically increased police staffing struggling to keep up with marijuana-related crime. 
Several council members said Tuesday that the presentation seemed one-sided, with Melendrez calling it “scare tactics” and “reefer madness.” 
Alex Chrystall, a resident of Conder’s ward, said the meeting left many unanswered questions. 
“As an educator, I’m a fierce advocate of critical thinking, and I was alarmed in March by the lack of clear answers and questions,” she told the council Tuesday. 
For instance, she said, if allowing marijuana caused such a disaster in Denver, why do voters there continue to support it? 
“Why has the City continued its legalization for the past four years?” she said. “If it is such a bad deal, why aren’t the citizens calling for it to be undone?” 
Perhaps, she said, it was because the $2.1 million spent on enforcement is dwarfed by the $22.7 million the city collects in marijuana taxes, on top of the state’s marijuana revenues. 
Other residents, including Cindy Roth, president and CEO of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, said they supported the ban. 
“We heard from many of our businesses about the problems they had in the strip centers next to them (when dispensaries opened),” she said. “Fights breaking out, paraphernalia left out, places where people thought there was a dispensary broken into.” 
The city’s Planning Commission voted in May against the change. Planning commissioners said they were frustrated they were asked to vote without receiving the information given to the City Council, according to a summary by David Murray, the city’s principal planner.

			A proposed law would allow many marijuana businesses in unincorporated Riverside County		
","Riverside County is considering a cannabis ordinance that would be among the most permissive in California, allowing just about every type of marijuana business permitted by state law to operate in unincorporated areas. 
A draft of the ordinance is set to come before the county Planning Commission at 9 a.m. Wednesday, June 20. The commission will discuss the policies and decide whether to recommend them for approval by the county Board of Supervisors; it’s not clear when, or if, the board will consider the ordinance. 
Though Prop. 64 made it legal in California for adults to use cannabis recreationally, the law also gives cities and counties the authority to regulate or ban most other marijuana activities within their borders. The idea of legal cannabis is less popular in Riverside County than in many other parts of the state; just 51 percent of voters in the county voted in favor of Prop. 64, compared with 57 percent approval statewide. 
The ordinance being discussed for Riverside County’s unincorporated areas would allow businesses to grow, manufacture, test, distribute and sell marijuana products for both the medical and recreational markets. It also would permit cannabis delivery services, microbusinesses that do multiple activities and cannabis-themed festivals. 
There are 58 pages of rules that businesses would need to comply with if they want to set up shop in unincorporated Riverside County. And those rules are in addition to 284 pages of rules issued by the three state agencies charged with regulating the cannabis industry in California. 
Cultivation, for example, would only be allowed indoors. All businesses would need major security and odor-control systems. Employees would need to be at least 21 and pass background checks. Also, in Riverside County, retailers would be required to have separate entrances for medical and recreational customers. 
The ordinance doesn’t appear to include a cap on the number of businesses allowed in any of the categories. But there are restrictions on zoning. 
And the county ordinance would bump up the mandatory distance between marijuana businesses and schools, day care centers or parks, with 1,000-foot separations required rather than the 600-foot requirement in state law. Both moves will limit the number of cannabis businesses allowed in Riverside County simply based on where viable property is available. 
To keep county staff from being overwhelmed, officials at a March board workshop suggest limiting the number of dispensary permits in the first year to 19, with a 50-permit limit for growers. 
The rules drew criticism from members of the public at the workshop. Many objected to the first-year limit on permits, while others took issue with restrictions on outdoor growing. 
The ordinance doesn’t make mention of permitting cannabis lounges, where people can consume marijuana socially the way they can drink alcohol in a bar. The lounges are important, industry advocates say, since Proposition 64 banned all public cannabis consumption and gives landlords the right to regulate marijuana use on private property. That means renters, tourists, and others are often left without a legal place to consume cannabis in California. 
The state doesn’t license cannabis lounges, but cities and counties can choose to welcome them. So far, Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs and West Hollywood are among the only places in Southern California with policies in place to allow for cannabis lounges. 
One permit that might draw a lot of interest in Riverside County is the one that would allow temporary cannabis events to take place. 
Under ew state laws, festivals that let guests buy and consume marijuana onsite must be held on one of the 80 county fairgrounds and agricultural districts scattered throughout the state.  And event organizers must first get written permission from the local city council, if the venue is in a city boundary, or the county board of supervisors if it’s in an unincorporated area. 
The state-owned Lake Perris fairground is in unincorporated Riverside County, which means the county has authority to approve cannabis festivals at the site. With venues in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties so far not welcoming to weed-themed events, this ordinance sets Lake Perris fairgrounds up to become a future hot-spot for cannabis festivals in Southern California. 
The ordinance would apply only to businesses that are outside incorporated cities in Riverside County. Anyone who wants to open a marijuana business inside city boundaries would have to comply with that city’s rules for the industry. 
If the ordinance passes, Riverside County would be among just 13 percent of California cities and counties that permit recreational marijuana sales. 
Only Humboldt, Inyo and Del Norte counties would have slightly more permissive rules on the books, according to a Southern California News Group database of local marijuana policies. Those counties allow adults 21 and over to cultivate up to six cannabis plants for personal use at home indoors or outdoors, while Riverside County blocks all outdoor marijuana gardens. 
Imperial County is the only other county in Southern California with such permissive policies on the books. 
Whether and how to regulate marijuana commerce in unincorporated communities has been a thorny issue for the five elected supervisors. Dispensaries, crops and the like are currently banned in unincorporated areas, with a limited exemption for medicinal marijuana. 
While several supervisors opposed Prop. 64, there’s also a recognition that cannabis businesses are an unregulated fact of life in areas of the county that aren’t part of a city. The push to regulate cannabis businesses stems largely from the desire to crack down on problems caused, for example, by growers who steal water and electricity and generate noxious odors that annoy neighbors. 
The board also has heard from cannabis entrepreneurs who see the potential for a booming new industry in the county’s vast swaths of rural acreage. 
Originally, the board planned to put a ballot measure before voters in November that would have imposed a local tax on marijuana to pay for regulatory efforts. If the tax failed, the ban on marijuana would have stayed in place. 
In March, supervisors voted 3-2 to ditch the tax and use fees from individual agreements with developers to fund enforcement efforts for the new ordinance. That concerns Lanny Swerdlow, a longtime marijuana activist from Whitewater. 
“If the ‘fee’ looks like a tax, walks like a tax and smells like a tax then it is a tax and bypassing a vote by calling a tax a ‘community benefit fee’ or any other name is forbidden by Prop. 218,” which requires voter approval of local taxes, Swerdlow wrote in a blog post. 
Supervisor Chuck Washington, who championed the developer agreement plan, argued a ballot measure, estimated to cost $750,000, was too costly and allowed all votes in a county of 2.4 million to decide land-use law for 379,000 people who live in unincorporated areas. 
The Riverside County Planning Commission, in a public meeting, will review a proposed ordinance that would allow and regulate marijuana commerce in the county’s unincorporated areas. 
The county Board of Supervisors will have the final say on whether the ordinance becomes law. 
When: 9 a.m. Wednesday, June 20. 
Where: First-floor board chambers, County Administrative Center, 4080 Lemon St., Riverside.

			What are the marijuana laws in your California city? Explore our database of local cannabis policies		
","With a patchwork of marijuana laws spread throughout California, reporters from this news organization have spent months collecting policy information from all 482 cities and 58 counties in the state. 
We wanted a way for individuals to be able to see the specific policies in the cities where they live, work and visit. And we wanted businesses to be able to see where they could open, how tax rates compare and more. 
Readers can sort this local marijuana policy data alphabetically or by score (points) that show how lenient a city is (higher points) or how strict a city is with its marijuana regulations (low points). They can also filter searches by county or by which places allow which business types, from recreational sales to medical testing labs (more on those types below the database). And they can select certain cities for side-by-side comparisons of their policies. 
And remember, each city’s regulations are likely to change over time as the state adapts to the new system. We will be updating this database as things change.

Here’s a look at what’s legal and what’s not when it comes to marijuana in California cities. 
Marijuana laws in California can vary widely from one city to the next, making it tough for residents to know where they can shop for legal cannabis, open a marijuana business or even what they can do in their own homes. 
That’s because, while Californians have been free to carry up to an ounce of marijuana and consume it in private since Proposition 64 passed in November 2016, state law gives local governments full authority to regulate or ban most other marijuana activity in their borders. 
We asked about local rules for all types of cannabis businesses, since cities (or counties, if the proposed address is in an unincorporated area) can choose to regulate these operations or ban them entirely. 
We also asked cities and counties about regulations they’ve imposed on the right (per Prop. 64) of residents 21 and older to grow up to six marijuana plants per home out of public view, since local governments can ban outdoor gardens and add other “reasonable” regulations. 
We used the policy information to give cities and counties a score from zero to 100, with zero for cities that are as strict as they can be under state law and 100 for cities that are the most permissive. (Learn more about that methodology here.) 
A patchwork of municipal codes can be seen in the map below, with concentrations of high-scoring, cannabis-friendly cities found in central Los Angeles County and the county seats of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino. Cities in the Coachella Valley and elsewhere in the desert also have opted to nurture marijuana businesses. 
Citizens of some cities heavily favored Proposition 64 in 2016 — others largely opposed it. The following graph shows how residents’ votes on the new state law jibe with that city’s home grow and business regulations, from the city of Industry, where there was little enthusiasm for Proposition 64 and local marijuana rules are strict, to Palm Springs, where nearly three-in-four voted for the initiative and every type of cannabis business can set up shop. 
We’ll be updating the database frequently, with cities and counties passing new cannabis regulations each week.

			A tale of marijuana in two Inland cities		
","Governments across the Inland Empire are continuing to grapple with the problem of marijuana prohibition versus regulation, even after majorities of voters in both Riverside and San Bernardino counties backed statewide legalization in 2016. 
Voters, in approving Proposition 64, made their thoughts clear on the issue of whether the farce of marijuana prohibition should continue or not. While some Inland communities, like Palm Springs, were well ahead of the pack long before Proposition 64 was passed by permitting medical marijuana dispensaries, most others are still lagging behind. 
Take, for example, the city of Riverside. Most voters supported marijuana legalization. Yet on July 10, the city council will discuss prohibition of all marijuana businesses except for laboratory testing facilities. On May 31, the city’s own planning commission rejected the proposal to prohibit marijuana, but Councilmen Chuck Conder and Steve Adams want to ignore the views of the public and proceed with prohibition anyway. 
While they’re understandably concerned with the potential public safety impacts of broader, legal access to marijuana, pretending prohibition in Riverside will keep marijuana out of the city is obviously mistaken. People will continue to purchase marijuana in and around Riverside on a legal and illegal basis, and consume it.

 The question is whether Riverside wants to bring the black market above ground and collect revenues from legal businesses to help mitigate any deleterious impacts of legal marijuana. That’s the matter at hand. 
Meanwhile, in the city of San Bernardino, marijuana legalization and regulation continues to be an overly complicated matter. Back in 2014, City Attorney Gary Saenz sought to “present a plan which essentially acknowledges the futility and high cost” of prohibition. Just as it appeared that effort was gaining momentum, it was silently killed. 
Fast forward four years later, majorities of San Bernardino voters have approved two legalization measures for the city, the prevailing measure was struck down in court, the city has put in place ordinances of their own and now they’re facing legal challenges and the prospect of even more ballot initiatives. 
Such a disjointed state of affairs is unfortunately one consequence of governments failing to heed the wishes of the public, accept the futility of prohibition and make legalization work.

			Marijuana is part of its religion, says Jurupa Valley church fighting city to stay open		
","An Inland church that uses marijuana to worship is embroiled in a bitter dispute with Jurupa Valley, which alleges the Vault Church of Open Faith is primarily a pot store and has been trying to shut it down for more than a year. 
An association representing the church and about 15 others like it fired back Friday, April 13, filing a claim against the city seeking $1.2 million in damages and alleging harassment and discrimination. Church leaders say they smoke marijuana or eat edibles as part of spiritual meditation as a religious sacrament, but city officials say they’re using religion as a front for selling pot. 
City Manager Gary Thompson said Jurupa Valley’s city attorney is reviewing the claim. Such a claim is often a precursor to the filing of a lawsuit. 
The church’s move comes as the city is pushing for a final decision to wrap up a suit Jurupa Valley brought in Riverside County Superior Court in early 2017 against what it maintains is an illegal dispensary. The Vault incorporated as a church in January and, as of Monday, April 16, was advertising on Weedmaps. 
The feud also comes weeks before city voters will be asked in June to choose between dueling ballot measures and determine whether commercial cannabis enterprises should be allowed in Jurupa Valley. Marijuana businesses of all types are banned now.

Church officials say the battle is essentially a case of religious persecution through municipal zoning laws, that violate the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. 
Brent Fraser, a founder of the The Association of Sacramental Ministeries of which the Vault Church of Open Faith belongs, said city officials are singling out the Jurupa Valley fellowship because it uses marijuana as a sacrament in meditative and other religious exercises. 
And it’s not fair, Fraser said. 
“We don’t ever question when they serve wine to minors at Catholic churches,” he said. “No one’s trying to shut them down. That doesn’t happen to the Catholic Church because that is their sacrament.” 
Fraser said cannabis has historically been used by other religions for many years, and it’s a genuine expression of the Jurupa Valley church’s faith. 
“It’s not a trick or anything like that,” Fraser said. “What law enforcement tends to do is think that everyone is faking it so that they can get stoned. That’s just not true. 
“These are not dispensaries. They are spiritual centers. They are healing centers,” he said. 
Cannabis-oriented churches have begun to proliferate across the state in the wake of the legalization of recreational marijuana, which took effect at the first of the year after passage of Proposition 64, a 2016 ballot measure. 
Thompson, the city manager, said the Vault continues to operate as a dispensary in a city that bars any type of marijuana enterprise. Despite recreational marijuana becoming legal across the state, municipalities have the ability to permit or ban cannabis businesses in their communities. 
“The bottom line is they are selling marijuana illegally,” Thompson said. “We have proof of that.” 
Court documents state that a city undercover investigator purchased marijuana Dec. 28, 2016. Shortly afterwards, the city sued the Vault. 
“At that time, it was never identified as a religious establishment,” Thompson said. 
Matthew Pappas, attorney for the Lake Forest-based association, said, “It was a secular dispensary before. That is true. We’re not going to say that it wasn’t.” 
But he said the Vault has undergone a conversion since. 
According to state records, the Vault Church of Open Faith filed articles of incorporation with the California secretary of state on Jan. 19 of this year. 
Conversion and incorporation aside, Thompson said the Vault appears to still be selling pot. 
“This particular location is also advertising on Weedmaps,” Thompson said. “It just seems kind of odd that any religious organization would sell a sacrament when it is administered as part of a religious ceremony.” 
The Weedmaps marijuana sales website listed The Vault Church at 5024 Etiwanda (Ave.) as a dispensary. Various strains of pot were listed as being for sale for $40 for an eighth of an ounce, and for $80 for a quarter ounce. Some were priced lower; some higher. 
Pappas, the attorney, said the Vault reluctantly allowed Weedmaps to classify the church as a dispensary in its directory. 
“Weedmaps doesn’t have a church category,” Pappas said, saying he hopes to change that. 
He said the church is using the Weedmaps listing as a tool for its missionary outreach. 
“Weedmaps happens to be  a venue that people go to when they are looking for cannabis,” he said. “We are trying to grow the membership of the church.” 
As for the church, it’s a small one that meets in the corner of a converted single-family residence in Jurupa Valley. 
Services are Sunday mornings. Cannabis, said Fraser, enters into the worship picture typically during a meditative or similar exercise. 
On Sunday, April 15, several members smoked pot during the service and at one point a minister helped a member smoke the cannabis sacrament through a pipe. 
Fraser said there are about 15 other churches within the circle of fellowship that includes the Vault Church of Open Faith. Most are in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, with a few in Washington state. Several more are expected to form shortly, he said. 
“The churches are not just a place where you pick up your weed and split,” Fraser said. 
They are places where genuine worship and fellowship is practiced, he said, saying the faith is less about a particular deity than about extolling virtues such as kindness, compassion, nurturing and a spirit of brotherhood. 
“Whatever you call your God, bring your God here,” Fraser said. “We will find a way to harmonize, rather than to fight with you.” 
“The moniker of open faith means that we welcome everybody,” he said.

			Temecula intends to keep ban on marijuana businesses		
","Don’t expect Temecula to alter its ban on marijuana dispensaries anytime soon. 
After learning in a poll that the majority of residents support the prohibition of commercial marijuana activities, the Temecula City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night, May 8, to keep the city’s ban in place. 
The council also asked officials to look at tightening Temecula’s policy on allowing medical marijuana deliveries without making it more difficult for patients to get their medication. 
The vote came more than an hour after city leaders heard the results of a poll asking about 1,000 Temecula residents for their views on issues involving marijuana. 
Sharon Pinkerton, of Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz and Associates, said that 55 percent of residents backed the city’s ban on commercial marijuana activities. 
The council adopted its ban, which includes the distribution, manufacturing and sale of marijuana, in June 2017. 
Pinkerton also said a majority of poll respondents oppose bringing medical or recreational marijuana dispensaries into the city. 
About 52 percent did not support the idea of letting stores in Temecula sell medical marijuana, Pinkerton said. Roughly 61 percent opposed the idea of stores selling marijuana for recreational use. 
The results came almost three months after the city’s cannabis subcommittee, whose members include Mayor Matt Rahn and Mayor Pro Tem Mike Naggar, supported a poll to get residents’ views on cannabis, a city report states. 
However, residents who responded to the survey didn’t agree entirely with the city’s complete ban on commercial pot activity. 
Nearly 70 percent said they supported laboratories that tested cannabis-related products for safety but did not sell products directly to residents, a city report states. 
At its meeting, the council asked city officials to look at the laboratory component to see if it fit in with the city’s master plan. 
In addition, residents supported patients getting access to medical cannabis, but not through dispensaries. The city voted not to ban medical marijuana deliveries last year. 
Though the city has banned commercial pot activities, it has allowed cultivation of up to 12 cannabis plants by patients and their caregivers if certain standards are met, the report states. 
In accordance with Prop. 64, the city allows residents to grow up to six plants indoors. Prop. 64 legalized recreational marijuana while giving cities and counties wide authority to enact the law. 
BY THE NUMBERS 
1,037: Number of Temecula residents likely to vote in November 2018 who were surveyed online and by phone. 
55 percent:  Number who support the city’s existing ban on marijuana businesses. 
71 percent: Number who support selling medical marijuana products recommended to patients by doctors. However, 52 percent did not support the city allowing storefront medical marijuana dispensaries to open. 
68 percent: Number who favor the city letting laboratories test marijuana products for safety and quality but not sell directly to customers. Labs testing marijuana products are prohibited in Temecula.

TEMECULA’S POT POLICY 
The city has banned medicinal and recreational marijuana businesses, including dispensaries, but there are exceptions. 
Delivery: Medical marijuana can be delivered to qualified patients and caregivers. 
Cultivation: Under Proposition 64, residents may grow up to six pot plants inside a single-family detached home or in an enclosed outdoor structure for recreational use. Growing plants outdoors is prohibited. 
Exemption: There’s a ban exception for medical cannabis for qualified patients and caregivers. For these individuals, up to 12 plants can be grown per patient or caregiver per residence. The maximum is 24 plants per residence.

			Riverside City Council commits to the folly of marijuana prohibition		
","Editor’s note: Breaking views are thoughts from individual members of the editorial board on today’s headlines. 
On Tuesday, the Riverside City Council voted 4 to 3 to prohibit marijuana businesses in the city. 
In doing so, the Riverside City Council made clear that it is incapable of properly representing the will of the public on marijuana policy. Most Riverside voters supported Proposition 64 in 2016, including majorities of voters in six of the city’s seven city council wards. 
Councilmen Steve Adams and Chuck Conder in particular indulged in plenty of reefer madness. Channeling the comical fearmongering of the 1930s over marijuana, they whipped up concerns about crime, about the children, about murder. It’s a worldview that puts them not only in the minority in Riverside, but in the country. 
There’s a reason increasing numbers of states have pursued and implemented marijuana legalization. There’s a reason Democrats and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly united to introduce federal marijuana decriminalization bills. And there’s a reason President Trump has indicated his support for ending federal marijuana prohibition and leaving it to the states. 
Most people understand that prohibition is a failure, that prohibition doesn’t mean that marijuana just goes away and that prohibition ultimately does more harm than good. But Chuck Conder, Steve Adams, Jim Perry and Chris MacArthur aren’t among them, and see it as their responsibility to perpetuate the folly of prohibition. 
In contrast, other members of the council seemed to at least understand that rushing to prohibition does the public a disservice. 
Councilman Mike Soubirous, for example, noted that the city could just as easily prohibit liquor stores on the same grounds the marijuana prohibitionists wanted to prohibit marijuana. What an absurdity that would be — right? Now carry that recognition of absurdity to the proposed marijuana prohibition. Same issues at hand.

 Neither prohibition nor legalization are a panacea, but legalization offers more control and revenue to address the negative consequences of marijuana or alcohol use, while mitigating the black market and all that comes with it. 
Councilman Andy Melendrez, meanwhile, rightly called out the “scare tactics” and incomplete information gathering to justify prohibition. While the prohibitionists cited everything negative about marijuana legalization in Colorado, they didn’t offer the other side of things. Nor did the council adequately consider the experiences of the other states that have legalized marijuana — or even their own neighbors. 
Last I checked, the sky hasn’t fallen in Palm Springs after several years of permitting medical marijuana dispensaries to operate. 
Alas, there’s no good in looking to the Riverside City Council for leadership on this issue in keeping with the views of the majority of Riverside voters. It’s apparent a ballot initiative will be needed to do the work the council is unwilling and incapable of doing.

			Hemet voters could see three marijuana initiatives in November		
","Hemet voters could see three cannabis-related initiatives on the November ballot after the City Council on Tuesday, July 10, decided to create its own measure to combat two other proposed measures. 
One measure to legalize marijuana-related businesses has already qualified for the ballot and a second has been proposed. Both are citizen-driven and would end the city’s ban of all marijuana-related businesses. 
“Philosophically, I’m opposed to someone coming in and riding roughshod on our city and putting an initiative that shoves their business down our throat,” Councilman Russ Brown said. “It’s coming, we can either control it or have it jammed down our throat.” 
Both measures are more lenient about security and where the businesses could be than the city would like. One would allow retail sales. 
Further complicating matters is the fact that backers of the second measure are suing the backers of the first measure, alleging it would create a monopoly. 
After hearing reports about a community survey on marijuana-based business and projected revenues, council members said they were more comfortable with only allowing medical marijuana-related businesses. 
“We need to take this opportunity to put it on the ballot and make our own rules,” Councilwoman Karlee Meyer said. 
The survey by FM3 Research showed confusion about marijuana businesses among the 653 people interviewed. The majority of respondents do not know it is illegal to operate a medical marijuana dispensary or recreational marijuana business in the city. 
Fifty percent of respondents favored allowing such businesses; 47 percent were opposed and 3 percent were undecided. 
When it came to the types of businesses, 72 percent of respondents supported dispensaries that sell medical marijuana, but just 44 percent backed selling pot for recreational use. 
People who favor cannabis businesses cite the revenue the city could take in and the medicinal benefits of the substance while those oppose cited concerns about crime and safety. 
The financial analysis showed the city could take in from $815,000 to $11.6 million a year, based on the numbers, type and size of businesses allowed. From 117 to 1,400 jobs could be created in marijuana and ancillary businesses, the study reported. 
If voters approve more than one initiative, the one receiving the most votes would win. If none pass, the city’s ban on all marijuana-related businesses would stay in place. 
The decision came on the same day that the city of Riverside permanently banned marijuana dispensaries and outdoor growing. 
Hemet’s initiative will be crafted by the city attorney’s office and brought back to the council for its Tuesday, July 24, meeting. 
The city has to work fast, as the deadline to get items on the Nov. 6 ballot is Aug. 10. The cost of putting the initiative on the ballot is not known.

Well, that, and the fact that Tuscaloosa leaders don’t have home rule and can’t make such a change without the Legislature voting to approve it. That means it would be needlessly politicized with the usual banter of misinformation that often stymies any effort for sensible change in our state.Last Thursday, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox and the City Council hosted state lawmakers from West Alabama for an annual breakfast that traditionally happens shortly before the legislators begin a session.One of the topics discussed was the problem Tuscaloosa has with jail overcrowding. This city is not alone in that. It is a problem throughout the state, but here locally it is at a crisis level. The mayor noted that the criminal justice system is overwhelmed. A huge contributing factor in that problem is that in Alabama if you’re caught with even a small amount of marijuana, state law says you’ve got to be locked up.More than half the nation has legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, 29 states so far. Seven states, and Washington, D.C., have legalized it for recreational use. A number of states have decriminalized the possession of a small amount of cannabis. Cities in neighboring states, such as Nashville, Memphis and Atlanta, have relaxed laws so that possession of a small amount is still illegal but there’s a fine instead of jail time.But here in Alabama, where our prisons are so overcrowded the federal government is threatening to step in and take them over, we still lock people up for small amounts of weed. As a result, valuable resources are spent on an effort that actually makes our streets less safe.“We don’t need to be tying officers up on this,” Maddox said, explaining that the effort to arrest and jail someone isn’t worth the effort, time and money. “We need to deal with this in a different pattern besides throwing someone in jail.”Most states where marijuana is still illegal have found it much more effective to have police just confiscate the marijuana and write a ticket. It’s been that way a few miles down the road in Mississippi for many years, where the first offense for up to 30 grams, or a little more than an ounce, is a $250 fine. Actually, Mississippi decriminalized small amounts way back in 1978.The city’s proposal wouldn’t legalize weed. It wouldn’t make it more prevalent. It wouldn’t lead to more drug use. It wouldn’t even change the penalties associated with a misdemeanor charge of possession.All it would do would be to free up hours of police officers’ shifts so they could spend time enforcing other laws, free up jail space and otherwise help prevent the waste and misuse of valuable resources.It’s a good idea and like many other good ideas, it is likely to get drowned out by half-truths and rhetoric in Alabama.

In fact, none of the penalties associated with the misdemeanor possession of marijuana would be altered.Rather, the city is seeking a change in how police must deal with those who are found with relatively small amounts of the drug. And Maddox said he’s willing to allow the Legislature to decide how little of an amount would qualify for the citation.About six of the state House of Representative and Senate members who represent portions of Tuscaloosa were in attendance for the breakfast, which the City Council hosts prior to the start of each session of the Alabama Legislature.The 2018 session begins Jan. 9 – the second Tuesday in January – because this is the final year of the quadrennial, or four-year term of the elected delegation.It begins earlier in the fourth year to allow legislators time to complete the session and return home to campaign for an additional term.This year’s breakfast was sparsely attended by the Tuscaloosa delegates. But of those who did show, some seemed willing to at least explore the city’s request on dealing with marijuana offenders.“I’ve always been a big proponent of decriminalizing marijuana,” said Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro.“We’ve got so many people sitting in our jails for small amounts of marijuana.“Where you have many states that are making it legal now, we have to look at that in the state of Alabama in terms of our overcrowdedness – I think we could see a big reduction – and I think this is a great step toward the city of Tuscaloosa looking at the seriousness of this crime but also allowing people who have just committed some minor incident to themselves by smoking a small amount of marijuana not to be filling our jails up.”Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, also said he believed the move to be a good idea.England reiterated Maddox’s point about how much time – sometimes hours – of an officer’s shift is spent on arresting, transporting and jailing someone caught with marijuana, no matter the amount.Allowing police to ticket those who have small amounts of the substance could reduce the officer’s engagement to about 45 minutes, England said.“It’s a public safety issue,” England said. “It’s more efficient and it actually keeps people out of jail who probably shouldn’t be there, anyway.”Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, wasn’t as enthusiastic as his fellow lawmakers.Poole, who chairs the state House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Education Committee, said changing how marijuana possession is policed at the local level would require a statewide change – not just one for Tuscaloosa – and doing so would demand a lot of consideration.“That would be a new proposal,” Poole said. “I haven’t seen anything like that in the Legislature. I think it would have a long way to go.“I think there’s a lot of analysis that would have to go into a proposal like that, and lot of public input. You’d have to really put it out there and have a public discussion on an issue like that.”Maddox touched on a number of other issues, as well.He asked the Legislature for help in regulating restaurants that, during the evening, transition into a more bar-like atmosphere. Currently, there is no license available through the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to indicate such a change.Creating one, the mayor said, would allow those living or working near these establishments to have a better understanding of what’s moving in next door.Maddox also voiced the City Council’s opposition toward eliminating prescription drug transactions from a pharmacy’s overall gross receipts. These sale totals are used to set business license fees and factoring out these sales would hurt municipalities.He estimated Tuscaloosa would lose about $200,000 each year.“And it’s not the mom-and-pop (pharmacies) that will benefit,” Maddox said. “It’s your large, out-of-state corporations that will gain the benefit of this.”Webb highlighted the city’s wish for legal liability limits extended to city employees as they are now for state or county workers.She also said the city would like clear legislation granting municipalities the authority to enforce parking regulations as civil citations. Now, cities are relying on a non-binding attorney general’s opinion to collect parking fees.Maddox also asked the delegation to consider altering the distribution model of the Simplified Sellers Use Tax and Remittance Program (SSUT), a voluntary program through which online retailers can pay a flat, reduced tax rate on certain online sales.Under this program, the state gets 50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent is divided among counties and 25 percent among cities, based on population.Currently, about 150 businesses – or about 1 percent of those that actually conduct business online in Alabama – have signed on to the program.And based on the collections and distribution model, the city of Tuscaloosa received about $409,000 in SSUT proceeds while Tuscaloosa County got about $533,000 in fiscal 2017.Maddox said this is unfair, primarily because most of the retail centers of a county lie within the corporate limits of municipalities.“Commercial sales have nothing to do with population. Commercial sales have everything to do with where those sales are occurring,” Maddox said.And unless some sweeping changes are made to how online sales are taxed in Alabama, the entire state stands to suffer, Maddox said.“Sales tax is analogous to a comet hitting the earth. The comet has hit the earth, and sales taxes are the dinosaurs,” Maddox said. “We’re all going to be impacted by it, from Huntsville to Mobile.”Reach Jason Morton at jason.morton@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0200.

Allowing police to ticket those who have small amounts of the substance could reduce the officer’s engagement to about 45 minutes, England said. 
“It’s a public safety issue,” England said. “It’s more efficient and it actually keeps people out of jail who probably shouldn’t be there, anyway.” 
Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, wasn’t as enthusiastic as his fellow lawmakers. 
Poole, who chairs the state House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Education Committee, said changing how marijuana possession is policed at the local level would require a statewide change – not just one for Tuscaloosa – and doing so would demand a lot of consideration. 
“That would be a new proposal,” Poole said. “I haven’t seen anything like that in the Legislature. I think it would have a long way to go. 
“I think there’s a lot of analysis that would have to go into a proposal like that, and lot of public input. You’d have to really put it out there and have a public discussion on an issue like that.” 
Maddox touched on a number of other issues, as well. 
He asked the Legislature for help in regulating restaurants that, during the evening, transition into a more bar-like atmosphere. Currently, there is no license available through the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to indicate such a change. 
Creating one, the mayor said, would allow those living or working near these establishments to have a better understanding of what’s moving in next door. 
Maddox also voiced the City Council’s opposition toward eliminating prescription drug transactions from a pharmacy’s overall gross receipts. These sale totals are used to set business license fees and factoring out these sales would hurt municipalities. 
He estimated Tuscaloosa would lose about $200,000 each year. 
“And it’s not the mom-and-pop (pharmacies) that will benefit,” Maddox said. “It’s your large, out-of-state corporations that will gain the benefit of this.” 
Webb highlighted the city’s wish for legal liability limits extended to city employees as they are now for state or county workers. 
She also said the city would like clear legislation granting municipalities the authority to enforce parking regulations as civil citations. Now, cities are relying on a non-binding attorney general’s opinion to collect parking fees. 
Maddox also asked the delegation to consider altering the distribution model of the Simplified Sellers Use Tax and Remittance Program (SSUT), a voluntary program through which online retailers can pay a flat, reduced tax rate on certain online sales. 
Under this program, the state gets 50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent is divided among counties and 25 percent among cities, based on population. 
Currently, about 150 businesses – or about 1 percent of those that actually conduct business online in Alabama – have signed on to the program. 
And based on the collections and distribution model, the city of Tuscaloosa received about $409,000 in SSUT proceeds while Tuscaloosa County got about $533,000 in fiscal 2017. 
Maddox said this is unfair, primarily because most of the retail centers of a county lie within the corporate limits of municipalities. 
“Commercial sales have nothing to do with population. Commercial sales have everything to do with where those sales are occurring,” Maddox said. 
And unless some sweeping changes are made to how online sales are taxed in Alabama, the entire state stands to suffer, Maddox said. 
“Sales tax is analogous to a comet hitting the earth. The comet has hit the earth, and sales taxes are the dinosaurs,” Maddox said. “We’re all going to be impacted by it, from Huntsville to Mobile.”

86,87,AL,www.tuscaloosanews.com,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20150108/news/605146305,Official: Heroin use on the rise in Tuscaloosa County,"Drug enforcement agents in Tuscaloosa County seized 78 types of drugs with a total street value exceeding $1 million last year. 
Drug enforcement agents in Tuscaloosa County seized 78 types of drugs with a total street value exceeding $1 million last year.The West Alabama Narcotics Task Force arrested 1,677 suspects on 3,121 drug-related charges in 2014, according to year-end numbers released by Tuscaloosa Police on Thursday. They arrested fewer people in 2014 than 2013, but brought more charges overall. In 2013, the unit charged 1,980 people with 3,003 drug offenses.West Alabama Narcotics Task Force commander Capt. Wayne Robertson attributed the rising number of cases to the growing population in Tuscaloosa County and increased enrollment at the University of Alabama.“I think it's just our aggressive approach on drugs in Tuscaloosa County that's causing these numbers to rise,” he said.Marijuana was the most common drug offense in the county. Agents seized nearly 91 pounds, or 41,114 grams, of it. They seized nearly eight pounds of synthetic marijuana, herbal substances treated with chemicals to mimic the effects of pot when smoked.Robertson said that the unit will focus on making arrests related to the sale of heroin and synthetic marijuana this year.“Those are the drugs we're most worried about right now,” he said. “They're the two drugs that we'll be really going after in 2015.Robertson attributed the rising use of heroin to the recent rise of prescription drug abuse. Many users have turned to the harder drug to get high, he said.Agents in 2014 seized 7,492 Hydrocodone pills and 24 grams of heroin. “Heroin is a bad drug, probably one of the most dangerous drugs I've seen, due to the purity of it,” Robertson said. “We have a lot of young people who are using this drug who aren't familiar with it and it's killing them. That worries me.”Decades ago, heroin use was more concentrated in poorer communities, he said, but has not spread to almost every socioeconomic group. Robertson said that the unit will focus on combatting heroin and synthetic marijuana, which he said is almost as dangerous.“I call it potpourri with chemicals on it,” he said. “We have a lot of overdoses. Young kids think that it's not harmful, but it is. Most of the time young people, or even older people, don't know what they're smoking.” The unit made a few major cases last year when they busted suspects with several thousands of packages of synthetic pot.Agents are beginning to see more ice, a more pure form of methamphetamine, moving into the city limits, Robertson said. Meth was more common in rural areas in past years, he said, and was often homemade by the users. “We're now seeing a more pure form coming across our borders,” Robertson said.Agents seized 613 grams of meth oil last year. They seized 970 grams of powder and crack cocaine.Robertson estimates the street value of the confiscated drugs is about $1.1 million.The task force seized $861,131 of cash and items they believe were related to drug transactions. Judges have forfeited $297,852 of that to the unit, which uses it to pay informants and for training, equipment, undercover operations, vehicles and staff.“It saves taxpayers a lot of money every year because we're able to take this money that's been made selling illegal drugs,” Robertson said.The 16-member unit is staffed by agents from the Tuscaloosa, Northport and University of Alabama police departments, the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office and Tuscaloosa County District Attorney's Office. WANTF conducted 69 educational programs within the county to educate children and adults about the dangers of narcotics, TPD spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley said.Reach Stephanie Taylor at stephanie.taylor@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0210.

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story.

A Senate committee on Wednesday approved a bill lessening marijuana punishments after a short but emotional debate that suggests the legislation will run into obstacles if it reaches the floor. 
Sen. Dick Brewbaker on the senate floor in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday April 18, 2017.  (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) 
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill, sponsored by Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road, on a 6 to 4 vote. The bill makes possession of an ounce or less of marijuana subject to a fine, not jail time, and alters punishments for possession of higher amounts. 
A House committee on Wednesday rejected an almost identical bill from Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, on a 7 to 5 vote. 
‘We are arresting more people for marijuana than for opioids,” Brewbaker told the committee. “Right now, the situation we are in, I think this is a reasonable approach.” 
Democrats Bobby Singleton of Greensboro; Linda Coleman-Madison of Birmingham; Hank Sanders of Selma and Vivian Davis Figures of Mobile voted for the bill, as did Republicans Tom Whatley of Auburn and Cam Ward of Alabaster, the committee chair. Republicans Clay Scofield of Guntersville; Larry Stutts of Sheffield and Phil Williams of Rainbow City voted against the bill, along with Democrat Rodger Smitherman of Birmingham. 
With a few exceptions, Alabama makes possession of marijuana for anything other than personal use a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Possession for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a jail sentence of up to a year and a $6,000 fine. According to the Alabama Sentencing Commission, 265 people went to prison in 2015 for first-degree possession of marijuana, meaning they were sentenced for intent to distribute. 
Brewbaker’s bill would tie the punishments to the amount possessed. Possession of more than two ounces of marijuana would be a Class C Felony, while possession of one to two ounces of marijuana would be a Class D felony, with prison time capped at two years and served in a community corrections facility. 
Possession of less than an ounce of marijuana would be a violation, subject to a fine and not incarceration. Under the bill, the first two offenses would result in a fine of $250. An offender would face a fine of up to $500 for later violations. 
Brewbaker told the committee that easing punishments for marijuana was broadly popular, even among likely Republican voters. 
Sen. Phil Williams at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday May 4, 2017.  (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) 
“They don’t want to see with very small amounts, lives ruined by that, and they also said they want the law to be absolute death on those who sell drugs,” he said. 
Williams made an attempt to kill the bill in committee and told Brewbaker he would filibuster the legislation if it reached the Senate floor. Williams said he had counseled people suffering from drug addiction and said weakening the penalties would lessen deterrence. 
“I never met a single addict who started off with their first toke to become an addict,” he said. “You weaken the penalties further than they are, all we’re saying is ‘You’ll get a slap on the wrist.’ That’s all you get.” 
Brewbaker, who also said he had worked in the field, said he found alcohol to be more likely to start people down the road to addiction. A car dealer by trade, Brewbaker said existing laws could make it difficult to hire worthy candidates. 
“I employ 109 people,” he said. “I’ve seen a lot of people trying to get jobs that we’ve hung a felony on for something they did when they’re over 18.” 
Singleton agreed with Brewbaker. “I’ve never seen a marijuana addict,” he said."

Two legislative committees will take up bills this week that, if approved, could ease punishments for simple possession of marijuana.

The bills, sponsored by Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road, should appear in the House and Senate Judiciary committees Wednesday afternoon. The legislation would, among other items, make possession of less than an ounce of marijuana punishable by a fine, not jail time. 
“You don’t want to hang felonies on college kids for simple possession that are going to follow them for the rest of their days,” Brewbaker said. 
The bills would not affect laws dealing with posessing or trafficking larger amounts of marijuana. A message seeking comment was left on Monday with Todd. 
The success of the bills, like most criminal justice initiatives, hinges on the support or at least the neutrality of the state’s district attorneys.  Brewbaker said he was expecting an amendment from the DAs that he said would address the enforcement of simple possession laws. 
“We need to find a way to make sure we’re not charging people with intent to distribute unless there’s actual evidence of intent,” Brewbaker said. “That’s one of the criticisms of the law right now. It’s not clear what rises to the level of evidence of intent.” 
A message seeking comment was left with Barry Matson, the director of the Office of Prosecution Services, on Monday. 
With few exceptions, possession of marijuana in Alabama for anything other than personal use is a Class C Felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Possession of marijuana for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine. 
The number of people sent to the state's correctional facilities for marijuana possession is relatively small. According to the Alabama Sentencing Commission, about 265 people went to prison in 2015 for possession of marijuana in the first degree. That year, about 24,000 people served time in Alabama correctional facilities. 
But Brewbaker said the law would ensure arrests for small amounts of marijuana possession would not follow someone throughout their lives. 
""I was in college once myself,"" he said. ""You’re not going to get old heads on young shoulders."" 
Todd and Brewbaker’s bills would tie offense levels to amounts. A person would need to have two or more ounces of marijuana to face a Class C felony. For one to two ounces, a person would face a Class D felony. Alabama law caps incarceration for Class D felonies at two years, with any prison time served in a community corrections facility. A Class D felony does not count toward Alabama’s Habitual Offender Law (also known as ‘three strikes you’re out”).

Possession of less than an ounce of marijuana would become a violation, without any jail time. A first or second offense would be subject to a fine of no more than $250. A third or subsequent offense would push the fine up to $500. 
The bills specifically exclude edible products and CBD oil, a marijuana derivative with little THC that has shown promise in treating some medical conditions. State law governs the use of CBD oil, the subject of a study at the University of Alabama Birmingham. 
Brewbaker, who worked with Rep. Christopher England, D-Tuscaloosa, last years on bills that ended judicial override in death penalty cases, said bipartisan efforts could boost the chances of passage. 
“Having Democrats and Republicans pushing the same bill seems to have some effect,” Brewbaker said. “It did on judicial override.”"

While speaking before federal, state, and local law enforcement about his plan to stem the flow of illegal drugs moving through the country and address the nationwide opioid crisis, he said he was “astonished” by suggestions that medical marijuana might be a cure. “I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. “And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana—so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful.

A proposed change to Leni’s Law means users of medical marijuana derivative cannabidiol (CBD) oil in Alabama could be allowed to buy oils with more THC in them. 
THC and CBD are both cannabis derivatives. THC is the psychoactive component known for giving users a high and is used for pain relief. CBD is nonpsychoactive and is used to treat pain, anxiety, epilepsy and other neurological disorders without the high. Under Leni’s Law, named for a child whose daily seizures are mitigated by CBD usage, CBD oils can't contain more than 3 percent THC ""relative to CBD."" For example if an oil has 10 mg of CBD, it could have no more than 0.3 mg of THC. 
Sen. Paul Sanford, R-Huntsville, proposed a rule at Legislative Council on Wednesday that would change the allowed THC level to 3 percent of the total volume. Sanford said that the “percent by volume” change was always the intent of the original bill, but the proposed change also came after hearing from families who said they needed more of the THC component for medical treatment. 
“We’re trying to get them to follow the intent of the law to make THC 3 percent of the total volume of the compound instead of 3 percent (relative to) CBD,” Sanford said. “Three percent (relative to CBD) lowers it to a level that makes it not effective for the patients.” 
Others in the Legislature agree that the level of THC in medical CBD oil should be raised and none of the lawmakers at the Legislative Council spoke against the proposed rule. The bill’s sponsor Mike Ball, R-Madison, told the Decatur Daily last year that “3 percent is very low; it should probably be 5 percent (relative to CBD).” 
And yet the proposed ""percent by volume"" change may have missed the mark, according to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences (DFS) and one of the leading cannabis test labs in Colorado, both of whom feel the increase to be too much. 
“That’s a lot of THC,” said Claire Ohman, director of CMT Laboratories in Colorado, which tests all medical marijuana products on the market. “If we go back to the example of the oil and you have the 8.5 oz. bottle and you took 3 percent of that, that’s a tremendous amount of THC.” 
Using that example, 3 percent of an 8.5 oz. bottle would be about 7.5 ml. Since the oil is measured in volume (ml) and the THC in mass (mg), the math gets a little sticky, but with THC’s density being close to the density of water, Forensic Sciences estimates an 8.5 oz. bottle of CBD oil could have up to 7,500 mg of THC under the new law. 
The recommended dose of THC in Colorado is no more than 10 mg per serving meaning that unless there are at least 750 servings in the bottle, the THC level may be higher than recommended. 
“They don’t understand that it will open up the amount of THC in there,” said DFS Director Michael Sparks. 
The estimate by DFS doesn’t calculate the amount of THC per serving, an important metric. The rule is also meant to implement a maximum level, not a suggested level, and those who are legally allowed to purchase CBD oil can buy whichever kind they'd prefer. 
In addition, Ohman said ingesting too much THC has no adverse health effect. It would just be “unpleasant,” she said. 
“Having THC in there is not a bad thing, but this is a tremendous amount of THC we’re talking about. The percent of total volume is a lot,” Ohman said. 
The rule is being sent to DFS for recommendation. Ohman said that as more states explore the medical properties of cannabis derivatives such as CBD and THC, states such as Alabama should reach out to states that have already done the research. 
“The states that have legalized cannabis have done a tremendous amount of work and have really ironed out a lot of the problems associated with legalization,” Ohman said. “There’s tremendous value in reaching out and talking to people in (a legalized state’s) Legislature as well as in the industry. There’s a lot to be learned, and we can serve as role models or provide a map towards legalization.”"

Gov. Phil Murphy is seeking to double the number of locations where New Jerseyans with medical cards can buy marijuana. 
Murphy's office announced Monday morning that the state Health Department will take applications to operate six new medical marijuana dispensaries, two each in southern, central and northern New Jersey. 
Last month, the Harmony Foundation in Secaucus became the sixth retailer where the more than 25,000 New Jersey residents with medical cards can purchase marijuana. 
Still, the expansion of retail locations hasn't kept pace with the number of new medical marijuana users, resulting in lines and occasional supply shortages. 
Murphy, a Democrat who also wants to legalize marijuana for non-medical purposes, has pushed changes in the medical program that have brought in 10,000 patients since January — a rate of 100 new people a day. Among other measures, the governor added to the list of conditions for which people can be prescribed marijuana. It now includes anxiety, migraines, Tourette's syndrome and two types of chronic pain. 
Murphy has aggressively expanded medical marijuana even as progress toward legal marijuana for any adult 21 and over has stalled. While Murphy and Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, have championed the idea of a legal marijuana marketplace with as many as 218 retailers, they have drawn skepticism and opposition from some fellow Democrats as well as many Republicans.

The medical program has been far less controversial. Murphy's bid to expand it has been greeted favorably by elected officials of both parties, even though his changes have not required votes of the Legislature. Rather, he has ordered Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal to change administrative regulations. 
“We look forward to the opening of six new dispensaries so we can ensure that all qualifying patients who want access to medicinal marijuana can have it,’’ Murphy said in a written statement. “Due to the steps that Commissioner Elnahal and I have taken since January, we have seen the addition of 10,000 new patients. Accordingly, we have to expand the number of businesses who are growing product and serving patients.” 
Elnahal has spoken to doctors at teaching hospitals in a bid to encourage more of them to prescribe marijuana for conditions such as chronic pain that had been treated with other drugs including opioid painkillers. Although 100 new doctors have signed up to prescribe marijuana since January, only 700 of the state's 28,000 licensed doctors — fewer than 3 percent — are licensed to prescribe marijuana. 
Marijuana is legal for medical patients in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Nine states currently allow adults to consume the drug without a medical permit."

","The Alaska marijuana control board has approved the license for the first cannabis testing facility in Interior Alaska, expected to open next month. 
The marijuana board approved the license for Fairbanks Analytical Testing Thursday in a 4-1 vote, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported . 
The testing facility has been under development since last year, owners Dylanne Macomber and Ronald Eads said. 
The new Fairbanks lab is fully operational, but it will need to get a final inspection in the coming weeks before the Alaska Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office issues the license, they said. 
There are two other testing facilities in the state — CannTest and Steep Hill — that are in Anchorage. 
Having a testing facility in Fairbanks will cut wait time and transportation costs for Interior growers, said Cary Carrigan with the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association. 
Macomber echoed that statement. 
""We are very sought after,"" Macomber said. ""The faster they get the results, the faster they can get (product) to the retailer and sold."" 
State tax records show there are about 30 marijuana cultivators that are active and paying taxes in Fairbanks and North Pole. 
Carrigan expects cannabis testing is going to more important as cultivators fight to stand out. 
""I am certain that people are going to be willing to pay more to have more elaborate testing done as this industry continues to roll forward,"" he said. ""It's a selling point."" 
Once open, Fairbanks Analytical Testing will offer soil sampling and cannabis analysis, including testing for potency, solvents and microbials. 
The lab will open with three employees, but Eads said they plan to grow along with the market.

District Attorney Doug Valeska said 41-year-old Steven Craig Hooven pleaded guilty to a felony trafficking marijuana charge in front of Circuit Court Judge Brad Mendheim. 
Valeska said Hooven received an enhanced sentence, of life in prison, because of three prior felony convictions out of Tennessee. 
Houston County Sheriff’s investigators arrested Hooven on Aug. 16, 2012, on the marijuana trafficking charge. 
The charge stemmed from a patrol deputy making a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Hooven for speeding on State Line Road near Cottonwood and US 231 South. 
The traffic stop led investigators with the Houston County Sheriff’s narcotics unit to get a search warrant for Hooven’s home where they discovered a large indoor marijuana growing operation. 
Sheriff’s investigators seized 238 marijuana plants that ranged anywhere from a few inches tall to 6 feet tall inside Hooven’s mobile home. 
Sheriff Andy Hughes said the marijuana had an estimated value of about $300,000. Hughes also said deputies also seized several artificial light fixtures and large bags of plant nutrients. 
“Pretty much a large majority of the home was dedicated to growing marijuana,” Hughes told the Dothan Eagle shortly after Hooven’s arrest. “This is one of the largest indoor grow operations in my 28 years of law enforcement. We’re very proud to get a dealer of this magnitude off the streets.”

","A Dothan mother faces a felony drug charge after police say she allowed her teenage son to smoke marijuana. 
Dothan Police Investigator Taiwan Truitt said he arrested Crystal Joyce Waters, 37, of Dothan, and charged her with felony chemical endangerment of a child. 
Truitt said the charge stemmed from an investigation into the burglary of a local Hop-In convenience store where Waters worked. She is not charged in connection to the burglary. 
Truitt said when he arrived at Waters’ home on Monday a strong odor of marijuana came out as a teenager answered the door. Truitt said as officers walked further inside the home the marijuana smell got stronger, and he saw a large orange and green glass smoking pipe inside. 
“Once we talked to her, she admits she allows her 17-year-old child to smoke marijuana in her house,” Truitt said. “She allowed him to smoke marijuana, and gave him permission by not saying anything to him.” 
Truitt said he also arrested and charged Waters’ 17-year-old son with misdemeanor second-degree possession of marijuana. He said police seized a small amount of marijuana from the teenager’s room. The teenager is charged as a juvenile. 
“It’s very seldom that you get a parent to all out admit to it,” Truitt said. “Typically what you get is parents smoking it in the house and there are kids inside ingesting it. This is my first experience of a parent allowing a child to smoke marijuana in the house.” 
Truitt said during an interview with the teenager that he learned the teen’s grandmother, Waters' mother, had actually introduced him to marijuana. 
“I also spoke to the juvenile, and he said at age 14 his grandmother gave him some marijuana for his birthday,” Truitt said. 
Waters’ was booked into the Dothan City Jail on the felony chemical endangerment of a child charge, and was later transferred to the Houston County Jail. Truitt also served a pending felony warrant filed against her by the Houston County Sheriff’s Office for felony first-degree possession of marijuana. 
Court records show Waters to be a convicted felon with one prior for felony marijuana possession.

            Florida Supreme Court disbars medical marijuana lawyer
        
","The Florida Supreme Court building in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2011. 
TALLAHASSEE (AP) — A Florida lawyer was disbarred Thursday for telling clients it was OK to possess, use and grow marijuana for medical use — more than two years before Florida approved medical marijuana. 
The Florida Supreme Court said in its order that some of Ian Christensen's clients were arrested and some lost their jobs because of his bad advice. One client who was provided a ""grow sign"" to announce he was cultivating marijuana at home was arrested after someone saw the sign and called 911. Another client growing marijuana had a SWAT team storm his home. 
Christensen formed Health Law Services in Jacksonville within a year of being admitted to The Florida Bar in 2013. He referred clients to a doctor who would ""prescribe"" them marijuana and then issued ""Official Legal Certifications"" and identification cards saying they had a medical need for the drug and could legally possess use and grow it. 
But none of it was legal and the doctor clients paid $799 to see wasn't even licensed to practice in Florida. 
""One of the clients lost her nursing license of twenty-five years and the other lost his engineering job of fifteen years,"" the court wrote. ""In addition, their landlord sued them for damages to the home during the raid and lost rent."" 
Voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2016 to authorize medical use of marijuana, and lawmakers last year put rules in place for its use and cultivation. Homegrown marijuana and smokable forms of the drug aren't authorized. 
Even so, Christensen was advising clients well before the amendment and subsequent law was passed. 
The court said Christensen's ""Official Legal Certification"" certificates were legally meaningless and his incompetence caused his clients serious harm. 
""Several clients who relied upon (Christensen's) erroneous advice were arrested and criminally prosecuted, and their lives were devastated,"" the court wrote. 
A message left for Christensen seeking comment wasn't immediately returned.

A father and son face drug trafficking charges after local authorities seized nearly $100,000 worth of marijuana from their Cottonwood residence. 
Houston County Sheriff’s Capt. Antonio Gonzalez said a joint investigation with the Dothan Police Department led to the discovery of a marijuana growing operation at a residence in the 3700 block of State Line Road in Cottonwood. 
Gonzalez said in a statement that deputies seized 42 marijuana plants on Wednesday from the property, some of which were as large as 3 to 5 feet tall. Gonzalez said in the statement that the marijuana plants had an estimated street value of about $92,000. 
“They were found behind a house in a wooded area,” Gonzalez said. 
Gonzalez said deputies arrested both Lee Carroll Brooker, 72, and his son, Darren Lee Brooker, 45, and charged them each with a single felony count of trafficking marijuana. 
The sheriff’s statement said both men were taken to the Houston County Jail and held on a $50,000 bond. If convicted, both men face 10 to 99 years or life in prison for the class A felony crime.

            Marijuana removal efforts working 
        
","Trooper pilot John Trimble flies over Tallapoosa County, Ala., as he and members of the Alabama Marijuana Eradication program, including the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Public Safety, the Alabama National Guard and local law enforcement agencies, search for marijuana plants Tuesday, June 29, 2010. (AP Photo/Montgomery Advertiser, David Bundy) 
Franklin County Sheriff Larry Plott remembers the years when marijuana eradication efforts would result in confiscating several thousand plants. 
“There were years when it was nothing to find 40,000 to 50,000 plants,” Plott said. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Alabama Marijuana Eradication Program and law enforcement agencies, Plott said things have changed. 
“You don’t see the large operations anymore,” Plott said. “Law enforcement is being proactive and combining resources to combat the illegal activity. Times have changed, a lot of that is because of the proactive approach law enforcement has taken with the eradication effort. 
“The eradication effort has become a deterrent to the growers.” 
The state marijuana eradication program began in 1982 and is funded through Drug Enforcement Administration grants using money seized in drug forfeitures. Since the late 1990s, department of public safety figures show the number of plants found have decreased each year. 
The eradication effort uses helicopters, both state and Alabama National Guard aircraft, to find marijuana plants. Pilots then call in ground teams of law enforcement officers to seize the illegal plants. 
The height of the marijuana growing season has started and that means teams will be flying until the first frost in the fall, Cpl. Robert Saffold, of the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, said. 
“Marijuana is the No. 1 cash crop in the state,” he said. “Put cotton, corn and the other crops together and it won’t touch marijuana.” 
The street value of a single plant at maturity is about $2,000, he said. 
Lauderdale County Sheriff Ronnie Willis said he would hate to see what would happen without the state’s marijuana eradication effort. 
“It works. I’ve seen fields found by helicopters with a thousand plants or more that wouldn’t have been found without them flying,” Willis said. “Because of that effort, you just don’t see those large marijuana fields anymore.” 
Curtis Burns, director of the Colbert County Drug Task Force, said when the eradication effort began, it was nothing to find fields with a 1,000 to 2,000 plants or even more. 
“There are less plants in our area than before,” Burns said. “One reason for that is because of the eradication efforts.” 
Lawrence County Sheriff Gene Mitchell said these days, “you might find a small patch of 100 plants out by someone’s barn. You just don’t see the big grows like there used to be.” 
Willis said in years past, many marijuana crops would be planted in forest land with elaborate irrigation systems and growing operations. 
“But the eradication effort has really brought those kind of operations to a halt,” Willis said. “It’s caused them to grow in smaller amounts and to start growing indoors.” 
Fewer plants found in the woods doesn’t mean marijuana isn’t being grown in the state, said Autauga County Sheriff Herbie Johnson. The success of the eradication program has led to more “house dope.” 
“We are finding more and more marijuana being grown inside,” he said. 
Burns said most of the marijuana grown now in northwest Alabama are indoors. “The eradication efforts have changed the habits of the growers.” 
Helicopters fly over each of the 67 counties in the state during a season. Some spots are searched several times a year, Saffold said. Northeast Alabama, with its mountainous terrain, is usually the leader in marijuana production. 
Authorities said because of the effects of the eradication program, much of the marijuana in northwest Alabama is shipped in from Mexico. 
“The main market is coming across the border, packaged and ready for sale,” Plott said. “That’s the problem we face now.” 
Elmore County Sheriff Bill Franklin said methamphetamine production also has cut into local pot production. 
“You can put a shake-and- bake meth lab in a plastic box,” he said. “Plus people get on the Internet and find information on making meth.” 
Pot is still used, and authorities still need to try to prevent as much marijuana as possible from hitting the street, Johnson said. 
“For most people, marijuana is the first drug they try,” he said. “You have a lot of young people, high school aged, and even in junior high, using marijuana. 
“It’s what gets them started using drugs. That alone is reason enough to go after pot.” 
Plott said if 100 plants can be taken off the street it still helps in the fight against illegal drugs. 
“That’s just 100 plants that someone will not use, which is a victory,” he said. 
Authorities agree that if the eradication effort should stop, the number of growers would steadily climb. 
“If we stopped flying, it wouldn’t take a year for our numbers to get back up to where they were in the early days,” Montgomery County Sheriff D.T. Marshall said. “Then you would find plots with thousands of plants again. Using the helicopters is a good deterrent.” 
Pilots and officers involved know where to look, Saffold said. 
“The dope growers are planting in more and more heavily wooded areas now. The plants may not grow as well, but they are much harder to find.”

","Colbert County Drug Agents arrest two people and confiscated seven pounds of marijuana shipped into the area through the mail 
TUSCUMBIA — Members of the Colbert County Drug Task Force arrested two people after they chased down a mail carrier to get a package that contained marijuana from California. 
Bradley Skipworth said Ramiro Garza, 37, of Riverside, California, and Bradley RaShawn Short, 29, of Dover Avenue, Sheffield, are each charged with trafficking marijuana. 
Authorities said the drug unit was working on information they received from the U.S. Postal Inspector’s Office that a shipment of marijuana was being sent to a Tuscumbia residence. 
Skipworth said agents were watching the residence, but no one was home when the mail carrier arrived. 
“The two suspects came up shortly afterwards and they tracked down the mail carrier to get the package,” Skipworth said. “As soon as they had the package, we were able to stop them and make the arrest.” 
He said the package contained 7 pounds of marijuana. 
Garza is out of jail on bail of $25,000, while Short remains in the county jail on bail of $25,000.

            Shipping dope increasing
        
","Colbert County Drug Agents arrest two people and confiscated seven pounds of marijuana shipped into the area through the mail 
TUSCUMBIA — Curtis Burns said there was a time when drug agents and law enforcement routinely found locally grown marijuana. 
“Those days are about gone. Now, it’s coming through the mail,” said Burns, director of the Colbert County Drug Task Force. 
The last two large marijuana seizures and arrests were after drug agents were notified by the U.S. Postal Inspectors Office of a shipment coming into the county. 
Burns said the last two shipments originated in California and had delivery addresses in Colbert County. 
On Tuesday, members of the drug task force arrested two people after they were accused of chasing down a mail carrier to get a package that contained marijuana from California. 
Bradley Skipworth, of the drug unit, said Ramiro Garza II, 37, of Riverside, California and Bradley RaShawn Short, 29, of Dover Avenue, Sheffield, are each charged with trafficking marijuana. 
Skipworth said the marijuana was shipped to a Tuscumbia address from Mira Loma, California. 
He said they were notified by the U.S. postal inspector’s office, and they set up surveillance on a Tuscumbia residence. 
Skipworth said agents were watching the residence when the mail carrier tried to deliver the package, but no one was home. 
“The mail carrier left and about two minutes later the two suspects show up and start trying to track down the mail carrier,” Skipworth said. 
Authorities said the suspects were tracking the package using an app on their cellphone. 
Reports indicate they followed the mail carrier throughout the neighborhood before getting him stopped. 
As soon as they had the package, law enforcement made a traffic stop on the car. 
“There was a strong odor of marijuana coming from the car,” Skipworth said. “We were given consent to search the car and found 9 grams of marijuana and various scales and other items used in selling the dope.” 
Burns said a search warrant for the package was obtained and the agents located 7 pounds of high-grade marijuana inside. 
In June, Burns said an investigation into the distribution of high-grade marijuana being shipped into the area and then sold has resulted in the arrest of three people. 
He said the investigation determined an average of 100 pounds of the high-grade marijuana was being shipped into the area each month from California. 
“The drugs are coming in, they are more expensive but they are higher quality,” Burns said. “There’s a lot of money being made selling marijuana. People had rather ship it in than take the risk of getting caught growing it and having to go through all the work. 
“I’m glad we have a good working relationship with the postal inspector’s office to try to stop some of these shipments from getting here.” 
Garza is out of jail on bail of $25,000, while Short remains in the Colbert County Jail on bail of $25,000.

            Ordering pot online leads to man's arrest
        
","FLORENCE – Information from another agency helped local drug authorities arrest a Lauderdale County man who is accused of ordering high-grade marijuana over the internet. 
“He was using technology to supply his habit, as well as supplementing his income,” said Tim Glover, director of the Lauderdale Drug Task Force. 
Denis R. Mullins Jr., 28, Judson Road, Florence, is charged with trafficking marijuana, unlawful possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia. 
Glover said the local drug unit received information from another agency that reported finding a person from Florence using the internet to order a large amount of marijuana from a Colorado grower. 
“He had placed an order for 20 pounds of marijuana,” Glover said. “Just because (marijuana) is legal to grow, sell and possess in Colorado doesn’t means it’s legal here. It is still illegal in Alabama.” 
Drug agents said the 20 pounds of the high-grade marijuana is sold for $25 per gram. 
“So, you’re looking at the 20 pounds having a street value of $200,000,” Glover said. 
Mullins reportedly sent the money for the marijuana to a California post office box. 
Once the order was paid for, Glover said drug task force agents got a search warrant for Mullins’ residence. Agents got the search warrant before the shipment was sent. 
During the search of the residence, Glover said agents reported finding 3-4 pounds of high-grade marijuana, plus a variety of paraphernalia, from scales to various smoking devices. Agents also reported finding evidence that Mullins was selling the marijuana he was purchasing. 
Glover said agents seized record books, computers and $8,536 cash from the residence. 
He said this is not the first time drug agents in the region have arrested people trying to get drugs from the internet. 
“And it’s not likely to be the last,” Glover said. “Technology is another avenue for drug users and dealers to get illegal drugs.” 
Mullins is out of jail on a bond of $29,000.

","A local man charged with purchasing “high-grade” marijuana over the internet will serve three years in prison.

            Muscle Shoals chief: Gummy marijuana being sold to teens
        
","Muscle Shoals Police, along with members of the Colbert County Drug Task Force Agency, seized gummy marijuana, marijuana wax, and a pistol during a recent search of a house. 
Nesbit 
MUSCLE SHOALS — Police Chief Clint Reck said he’s hoping a recent drug arrest made by his department and the Colbert County Drug Task Force will send a “loud and clear” message to drug dealers. 
“We want people to know this is not going to be tolerated, this kind of activity. If they going to sell dope, they need to get out of Muscle Shoals,” Reck said. 
Members of the police department and Colbert County Drug Task Force have arrested a man accused of selling “candy” marijuana. 
Zachary Tyler Nesbit, 20, 313 Grand Ave., Muscle Shoals, is charged with first-degree possession of marijuana and unlawful distribution of marijuana. 
Reck said a search of the residence revealed a bag of gummy marijuana, scales and two guns, along with a security system set up outside the house. 
“These people were selling this to our teens, and I want parents to know we are not going to tolerate it,"" Reck said.

            Tuscumbia warehouse gets unexpected delivery
        
","Tuscumbia Police and Colbert County drug agents recovered 92 pounds of packaged marijuana that was delivered to a Tuscumbia warehouse. 
TUSCUMBIA — An unordered delivery of three packages to a Tuscumbia warehouse Tuesday turned out to contain about $100,000 of illegal drugs. 
Authorities said security at the warehouse, located on John Aldridge Street, called them after the packages were delivered. 
“They had no idea what they were, and when they went to open one, they saw that it was a box inside a box,” Police Chief Tony Logan said. “They got suspicious and called us. When we got there, we realized what it might be and called the Colbert County Drug Task Force.” 
Curtis Burns, director of the Colbert County Drug Task Force, said they obtained search warrants and opened the three boxes. 
Logan said the boxes contained 92 pounds of medium- to high-grade marijuana, worth about $100,000. 
Police said the shipment originated in Texas and was sent to a residence in Jackson, Mississippi. 
“It’s our understanding, someone at the residence in Mississippi refused to accept delivery, saying they did not know anything about the shipment,” Logan said. “So the boxes were shipped to the return address, which was to the warehouse here in Tuscumbia. “ 
The chief said people at the warehouse had no record of the boxes, their shipment, or them being shipped back to the warehouse. 
“They were as surprised as we were when we opened the box,” Logan said. 
Logan said the boxes appeared to have been packed “by professionals” in the drug business. 
“The dope was in a vacuum-sealed bag, which was inside a box, inside the outer box,” the chief said. “There was a foam substance that had been sprayed, sealing all of the cracks so as to prevent the marijuana odor from getting out. Plus, there was fabric softener on top to keep the smell down. 
“Whoever packaged it went to a lot of trouble.” 
The chief said the Colbert County Drug Task Force and his department are working with law enforcement agencies in other states to track the origin of the boxes.

That happened to a couple in Orlando recently. They ordered some storage bins from Amazon and the package weighed more than it should have. They opened to see what was inside and found 93 Lbs of weed. Needless to say they were shocked and called the police. The crazy part is it came from Amazon, go figure.

            Leave marijuana to the states
        
","Reversing an Obama administration policy, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has abandoned the hands-off approach to states that have legalized marijuana, threatening to disrupt those states' newly formed legal markets. Sessions abandons federalism when it suits him, and it's time for Congress to take the power out of his hands and give it unambiguously to the states. 
The U.S. is in the middle of an opioid epidemic. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2014 to 2015, overdose-related deaths from one opioid alone, heroin, increased by 20.6 percent, with nearly 13,000 people dying in 2015. 
Meanwhile, there remain no known marijuana overdose deaths, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and studies have found states that have legalized marijuana have seen a decrease in opioid-related deaths. 
So, of course, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decided to ramp up the fight against legal marijuana. 
On Thursday, Sessions rescinded the Obama administration’s relatively hands-off policy toward states that have legalized marijuana for either medical or recreational use. Federal prosecutors where marijuana is legal under state law will now be free to decide for themselves how aggressively to enforce federal laws. 
The Justice Department doesn’t have the resources to truly crack down on marijuana in states where they have no state and local support. But it doesn’t necessarily need them. 
The main effect of Sessions’ action is to cause uncertainty, which will disrupt the newly burgeoning legal pot markets in states such as Colorado and California. 
The prospect of an aggressive federal prosecutor swooping in isn’t just a threat to marijuana businesses, but also anyone who does business with them, such as financial institutions or landlords. 
Not coincidentally, Sessions also opposes reforming civil asset forfeiture, which allows the government to seize the property of the accused even before they’re convicted of a crime — and makes it difficult and sometimes impossible even for those found not guilty to get their property back. A landlord renting to a marijuana-related business might well have his rental property seized by the feds, should a federal attorney emboldened by Sessions’ renewed anti-marijuana crusade be inclined to press the issue. 
Disrupting marijuana businesses is exactly what Sessions intends. He may lack the resources to carry on a full-scale drug war without state and local cooperation, but he can create chaos. 
Why would Sessions do this given a majority of Americans now favor marijuana legalization and the evidence marijuana use deters use of more dangerous drugs such as opioids? 
Sessions is proudly stuck in the past and claims marijuana is “only slightly less awful” than drugs like heroin. 
“I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. But too many lives are at stake to worry about being fashionable. I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store. And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana — so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful,” Sessions told law enforcement officials in a speech last year. 
That Sessions is unfashionable is true, but irrelevant. More to the point, he is dangerously mistaken. 
Even if legal marijuana sales weren’t correlated with a decrease in opioid overdoses, legal sales might well result in fewer “marijuana-related” deaths. 
As The Washington Post’s Wonkblog noted last March, “Marijuana itself is not a deadly substance. ‘No death from overdose of marijuana has been reported,’ according to the DEA. But ... (at least 20) deadly (SWAT) raids on suspected marijuana dealers (since 2010) underscore how drug enforcement can become a greater threat to life and safety than drug use itself.” 
Senators in both parties spoke out last week against Sessions’ action. A bill in the U.S. Senate, S.1689, the Marijuana Justice Act, would end marijuana prohibition at the federal level and turn it over to the states. 
Sessions may embrace federalism only when it suits his fancy, but the Senate should embrace it here and leave the war on marijuana up to the states that still choose to wage it, and not force it upon those that don’t. 
Decatur Daily Editorial. Feb. 8,2107 
Would you have said this to California? 
Calhoun Community College President Jim Klauber says he is increasingly concerned by comments he hears from business leaders, including those in the space industry and military contractors. While they are pleased with the training job applicants have received, there are too many who can’t get jobs because they fail drug tests or have drug- or alcohol-related infractions on their records. 
Klauber said the school is considering a voluntary testing program for students enrolled in skilled training programs, which are largely funded with state money. 
Community College System Chancellor Jimmy Baker said such testing could become mandatory. 
“We feel like we can’t afford to spend the money it takes to provide the skilled training programs if we know they aren’t going to be able to get jobs,” Baker said at a recent budget hearing in Montgomery. 
Sadly, this is not a new development. The state has been hit hard by a wave of illegal drug use that is crippling not only the ability to maintain a reliable workforce, but to the people ensnared by addiction. 
During the budget hearing, Sen. Trip Pittman, R-Daphne, said the Alabama Industrial Development and Training program tested job seekers before training them several years ago. He said the testing showed AIDT was spending “tens of millions of dollars training numerous people who were not going to be qualified for the positions.” 
Under normal circumstances, drug testing those seeking training would be an unusual step. Under current circumstances, it appears that testing before training is an option that must be considered. Taxpayers are understandably frustrated at the idea of providing specialized job training for people who cannot pass a drug test. 
The other side of the problem is the prevalence of drug abuse. Not only is methamphetamine rampant, the abuse of prescription medicines such as Xanax is widespread. How to combat the epidemic is up for debate, but without a plan of some sort, it will only get worse. 
A sense of hopelessness seems to have settled over high-poverty areas of Alabama. State services have been cut to the bone; access to quality medical care is becoming more difficult; and employers are coalescing around metropolitan areas. That seems to be contributing to the rise in drug abuse. 
But one thing Alabama has gotten right is jobs training at the post-secondary education level. Employers can rely on state assistance through education to provide trained workers to meet their needs. 
Providing that training to people who have active substance abuse problems is not a good investment. A better approach would be to first offer treatment options after confidential drug testing. Once they have shown the ability to overcome substance abuse, jobs training is the next step to helping them become productive participants in an economy that needs workers who are skilled and reliab 
It's not in the AG's scope to decide which laws to follow and which ones to ignore. I think pot should be legal.But that's up to congress to change the law. The DD has always talked out of both sides of their butt.When Alabama passed laws that reflected the Federal laws pertaining to illegal immigration where was the DD? 
The writer obviously has never had the opportunity to run a business and see how it affects families. You have never seen employees that put the joy of smoking over the feeding of their babies. You expect free health care when in most cases these people could afford their on health insurance if they chose to be responsible adults instead of pot heads. They lose days of work because of substance abuse. It affects their quality and quantity of work. Your article purports to be about states rights but in reality you are promoting a decadent society where it's self-gratification comes before responsibilities. 
You’re for States rights?  No matter the issue States rights are States rights. Where were you on States rights on same sex marriage or immigration or the countless other issues during the Obama administration? Let me answer that for you, you were against the States. Typical Decatur Daily, writing with both ends of the pen. Either you’re for them or against them you can’t have it both ways. 
Exactly correct! 
No doubt the State will see an increase in vehicle accident deaths from this drug as have ALL the other States who have legalized Maryjane within their borders. We can expect to see an increase in our automobile insurance rates for sure. Almost ALL of the new dispensers of legal MaryJane are of a select few who have the wealth & politics to garner their license-to-sell. The cash-only transactions create the opportunity to bypass taxes with accountability hard to trace...and the security risk to business itself for theft & worse. So getting ""mellow & high"" legally has a price attached to it for our local Society.We all want our State Rights for local rule so let the voters decide if the State wants to go down the legal path of enriching a very few for a few to lite up with legal dope.

            Police: Trinity woman smoked marijuana while pregnant
        
","A Trinity woman was arrested Monday for allegedly smoking marijuana while she was pregnant, according to the Decatur Police Department. 
Katelyn Maye Siple, 24, 698 Old Highway 24, gave birth to a baby girl at Decatur Morgan Hospital on Jan. 1, according to reports. The baby tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, police said. 
The Morgan County Department of Human Resources reported it to police on April 20. Detectives obtained a warrant for Siple’s arrest for chemical endangerment of a child on June 7. Siple turned herself in to the Decatur Police Department on Monday, police said. 
The investigation by DHR and police found Siple smoked marijuana while she was pregnant, even though she knew she was pregnant, police said. 
Siple was being held in Morgan County Jail with bail set at $2,500. 
At this time, it is unknown if the child will suffer any long-term effects as a result of the drug exposure, police said.

            Phillip Tutor: Legal weed and good people in the U.S.
        
","That doesn’t indict me as a reprobate or criminal, just a customer at an upscale medical and recreational marijuana dispensary in the tony LoDo district of Denver, where my wife was attending a work conference. Everything was legal. And, to be honest, I didn’t buy mere pot. 
For $25, I bought the Strawberry Crunch flavor of Incredibles, a cannabis-infused white-chocolate bar with strawberries and puffed rice made by a Colorado company. Edibles — that’s what food made with cannabis is called — offer a more potent delivery method than smoking marijuana, so don’t binge-eat the stuff; my chocolate bar contained 100 milligrams of THC measured into 10 evenly divided pieces. 
Imagine a large Hershey’s bar, except different. 
Walking out of a dispensary in Denver with a bag of edible marijuana. 
Sessions, the former U.S. senator from Alabama hand-picked as President Trump’s attorney general, would have me arrested, I assume, since he believes marijuana is a national scourge. Reefer madness, one Alabamian to another. But his one-man War on Weed, backed by the power of the Department of Justice, has threatened upheaval on America’s movement toward legalized marijuana and an industry expected to be a $2.3 billion windfall for states by 2020. 
Already, nine states have legalized recreational marijuana use. In 2014, Colorado became the first state to allow marijuana dispensaries for recreational use. Medical marijuana is legal in 20 states; 17 others, including Alabama, allow medical use in low-THC and cannabidiol forms. Only four states allow no legal access. 
Sessions’ rollback of Obama-era guidelines on federal intervention of states’ marijuana laws exemplifies his draconian position steeped in evangelical Southerness and ignorance. But that’s who he is. At a Senate hearing in 2016, Sessions said marijuana is “in fact a very real danger” and “that good people don’t smoke marijuana.” But wait, Jeff. Do good people smoke tobacco that causes cancer? Do good people drink alcohol in excess that leads to long-term health concerns? Do good people OD and die from prescription opioids? So much for inconvenient comparisons. 
This year the World Health Organization released a report on cannabis that acknowledged its effects on human health but said it is “a relatively safe drug, which is not associated with acute fatal overdoses.” Sessions would disagree, of course, since only in Trumplandia would the attorney general consider prosecution of dispensaries state governments had legalized. Say this much for Trump: he hasn’t killed Sessions’ War on Weed and the 70 percent of Americans who support some sort of legalized use, but he’s neutered it by saying he’d sign legislation to protect states that had legalized medical marijuana if it reached his desk. 
Now, about that pot. 
Colorado Bars are made, a THC infused edible that is dipped in both white and regular chocolate at Dixie Elixirs in Denver, Oct. 29, 2014. 
I bought my cannabis-infused chocolate bar from the Rocky Mountain High Dispensary on Denver’s Wazee Street. Four blocks away is Coors Field, where the MLB’s Rockies play. In almost any direction are restaurants, shops, bookstores and bars of Denver’s 16th Street Mall. If it were in Birmingham, it’d sit smack dab in the middle of Five Points. 
From the outside, it looks like a small clothing store — expensive wooden floors and display cases, nice furniture, open and airy. Branded T-shirts for sale line one wall. A lone desk sits in the center. No marijuana is seen from the street. 
I walked in, glanced around for a second until a man appeared from an office. He asked for my ID, which I handed over. 
He checked it and gave it back. 
“You can go back now,” he said. 
He then opened a rear door and ushered me into a separate room — smaller, with glass display cases and shelves on the wall. An ATM sat in a corner. A young woman worked the counter. 
She asked for my ID, which I handed over. 
She checked it and gave it back. 
“What are you interested in?” she asked. 
Which wasn’t a stupid question. She meant, what kind of marijuana was I interested in? Pre-rolled? A certain strain? A certain type of edible — gummies, chocolate bars, chewables, lollipops, capsules? Recreational or medicinal? It was like bellying up to a bar and facing 20 beer taps and an array of liquor bottles. The choices were limitless. 
For some reason, I asked about the edibles, perhaps because the display case was no different than the candy aisle at CVS, just fancier. Bright colors, amusing names: Cheeba Chews! Green Hornet Gummies! Fruit Punch Mints! She explained the science of edibles, the enhanced potency, the different kind of highs the strains provide. I picked a Strawberry Crunch chocolate bar because I’ve loved strawberries since I was a kid. Couldn’t go wrong there. 
In minutes, I walked out holding an elegant paper bag — think posh jewelry store — emblazoned with the dispensary’s name and logo. All legal, all above board. Sorry, Jeff. 
My wife was waiting nearby. Off we went. 
A few days later, we packed our bags and checked out of our hotel. 
I left the chocolate bar on the table, a gift for our housekeeper. Hope she enjoyed it.

            Chemical-fueled explosion causes fire at Arizona marijuana facility
        
","Authorities are investigating a fire that happened at Arizona Development Services, a marijuana cultivation facility. 
The Coolidge Fire Department responded to the facility around 6:51 p.m. on Sunday, The Casa Grande Dispatch reports. 
Fire Chief Mark Dillon says the call initially came in as a fire caused by a lightning strike, but crews later discovered that the fire was actually coming from an internal source. 
Fire officials say the materials led to an explosion within the building. 
No one was inside the building at the time of the incident. 
Crews managed to put out the fire shortly after 7:30 p.m., but that was not before it managed to do significant damage to the structure. 
Dillon says initial damage estimates will likely be in the range of $100,000.

            Proposed marijuana legislation goes up in smoke
        
","As the Alabama Legislature’s 2015 regular session came to a close Thursday, bills related to marijuana use and penalties remained dead on the floor. 
That keeps Alabama at odds with 23 states and the District of Columbia, which all have laws legalizing marijuana in one form or another. While Alabama does allow seizure patients limited access to medication containing therapeutic compounds from the plant, it does not allow residents to legally possess, sell or grow cannabis in its natural form. 
Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, has been one of the few Alabama legislators to sponsor efforts at marijuana reform. Over the past five years, the representative has sponsored bills that would allow patients with certain medical conditions access to the plant and others that would reduce the penalties for first-time offenders charged with simple possession from misdemeanor charges to a simple fine. 
Although the bills had the support of legislators and advocacy groups, there has not been enough impact to change the beliefs of the political majority in the state.  Numerous attempts to reach Todd for this story were unsuccessful. 
One of the things standing in the way of marijuana reform in Alabama, according to Rep. K.L. Brown, R-Jacksonville, is the general mindset about the plant, something Brown experienced firsthand when he sponsored a 2012 bill that would allow patients with certain conditions access to medical cannabis. 
“There’s a stigma in the State House and a lot of people from the ’60s that still hangs around,” he said. “I don’t think people are open to discussion.” 
Ron Crumpton is executive director for the Alabama Safe Access Project, an organization that supports cannabis advocacy and reform. He says that the politicians’ constituents influence the way that they vote on divisive issues like this one. 
“It’s crazy,” he said. “I think we have people in Montgomery who would be open to change but fear the public’s perception.” 
Crumpton also added that reform would not happen without the support of law enforcement and district attorneys — support that could be hard to come by. 
Calhoun County Sheriff Larry Amerson deals with marijuana offenses on a regular basis, and says a number of inmates in the county jail are there on charges related to pot. While he concedes that there are people who want to see the laws changed, he wishes they would take authorities’ experiences with it more seriously. 
“Law enforcement people across the country see the impacts of drug use up close and personal. We’ve seen it, we have a valid perspective, and we hope people will respect it,” Amerson said. 
Although chances at passing laws in Alabama this year have passed, Crumpton remains optimistic and dedicated to the marijuana reform movement going into 2016. 
“We’ll be back next year doing the same thing,” he said.

HEFLIN — One person was arrested and charged with felony drug trafficking during a traffic stop on I-20 early Saturday morning. Heflin police officers Tyler Murphy and Chris Cohran stopped a 2013 Hyundai Sonata for a minor traffic violation and noticed the strong scent of marijuana, according to Murphy. 
“We were patrolling interstate 20 west — we observed a vehicle have some traffic infractions — crossing over the centerline,” Murphy said. 
Murphy said the driver, Reginald Curry Jackson, 35, of Smyrna, Ga., admitted to having a weapon inside the vehicle but said he did not have marijuana. 
The officers conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle and found small pieces of marijuana in the driver’s side floorboard. 
“Appeared to be wet — like he tried to eat it — I guess he decided to spit it on the floorboard and tried to scrub it out with his foot,” Murphy said. 
The officers found two bags of marijuana brownies and a bag of THC laced gummies in the back seat. 
In the trunk the officers found: 
— numerous bags and boxes containing THC laced lemonade marked “420” 
— Imitation gauze packages containing 3.5 grams of marijuana 
— Vaporizers containing THC liquid with refills and chargers 
— More marijuana brownies marked “420” 
— THC-laced fried cheese snacks 
— A digital scale hidden in a CD rom disc holder 
— Pepsi can with hidden compartment 
Jackson admitted to the officers that he had planned to make a profit with the items. 
“This was his whole income tax return,” Cohran said. 
Jackson was taken to the Cleburne County Jail. 
Heflin Police Chief A.J. Benefield said that parents need to watch out for the type of drugs seized by Heflin police Saturday. 
“How many police officers would have missed that? If average police officers are missing that how many parents would not know what it is,” Benefield said. 
“If you walk into a get-together — if they have brownies stacked up or lemonade or gummies — how many parents are going to walk right past that?” Benefield said.

            Childersburg woman jailed since May charged with Xanax, marijuana possession
        
","A Childersburg woman incarcerated in the Talladega County Jail since May on a disorderly conduct charge is now facing felony contraband charges. 
Alicia Pertate Wesley, 36, was initially arrested by deputies on May 31, according to Talladega County Sheriff’s Sgt. Mike Jones. She apparently never posted the $1,000 bond on the misdemeanor charge. 
During a search on June 28, Xanax and marijuana were allegedly discovered in her cell, Jones said. It was not clear where Wesley got the contraband. 
Wesley was formally charged with promoting prison contraband in the second degree and was given a $5,000 bond on that charge by District Judge Jeb Fannin. 
Promoting prison contraband in the second degree is a class C felony in Alabama, punishable upon conviction by one year and one day to 10 years in prison.

            Decriminalize marijuana
        
","Re “Stop the revolving door” (Speaker’s Stand, Sept. 5): 
Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb’s recent op-ed in The Star was right on the mark. Alabama’s crowded prisons are largely the result of our state’s unworkable drug laws, especially those regarding marijuana. 
Our state’s marijuana penalties are among the harshest in the nation, not just for cultivation and distribution, but also for simple possession. Though unlawful possession for personal use results in a misdemeanor upon first conviction, second offenses and almost any other marijuana offense result in a felony. 
The current legal penalties for marijuana result in an entire class of non-violent Alabamians needlessly turned into felons, which will negatively affect them for rest of their lives, all to combat a plant that has been proven safer than alcohol. Not only do marijuana cases clog Alabama’s prisons and courts, they distract law enforcement from more serious crimes. Our limited law enforcement resources would be better spent locking up violent criminals. 
It is my hope that the Alabama Public Safety and Sentencing Commission will take a serious look at Alabama’s misguided marijuana laws and recommend reforms that remove marijuana from the criminal code. Especially as we face continuing state budget crunches, Alabama needs to do a better job of stewarding limited public funds. Reforming our marijuana laws is a good step in that direction.

            Ex-Tide star Foster arrested on marijuana charge
        
","Former Alabama linebacker Reuben Foster was arrested Friday night on a charge of second-degree marijuana possession, according to the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff’s Office records. 
Foster, now a member of the San Francisco 49ers, remained in jail on $2,500 bond as of 10 p.m. 
During his senior season in 2016, Foster won the Butkus Award given annually to the nation’s top linebacker and was first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection. He registered 115 total tackles as part of the Tide’s national runner-up finish. 
Foster ran into trouble shortly thereafter. He was sent home from the NFL Scouting Combine after he got into a heated exchange with medical personnel while waiting for his physical. It was also reported he failed a drug test at the Combine, but another report stated his urine sample was dilute — which automatically counts as a positive test. 
Still, the 49ers drafted Foster with the 31st pick in the draft. He finished his rookie season with 59 tackles. 
Foster entered the Alabama locker room following its 24-6 win against Clemson in this season’s Sugar Bowl, much to the delight of his former defensive teammates, who mobbed him upon his arrival.

HEFLIN — Two people arrested in Heflin were charged with felony marijuana trafficking during a traffic stop on I-20 Thursday morning. Heflin police officers Danny Turner and Chris Cohran stopped a vehicle for a routine traffic violation and noticed the familiar scent of marijuana. 
“We saw a vehicle come by that was impeding traffic in the left lane — did an improper lane change and didn’t have any brake lights,” Turner said. 
Turner said he performed a traffic stop to tell the driver the violations and explain driver safety and equipment violations. 
“In the process of the encounter we noticed that they were overly nervous and that there was the odor of raw marijuana emitting from within the vehicle,” Turner said. 
Turner checked the the occupants’ licenses but due to the strong odor of marijuana the officers performed a probable cause search of the vehicle. 
“During the search of the vehicle we located a duffle bag in the trunk of the vehicle that contained ten packets of marijuana which was heat and vacuum sealed,” Turner said. 
The weight of the substance was 10 pounds total, he said. 
The officers also noticed marijuana “residue of marijuana debris” in the car in addition to the odor. 
Alexus Williamson, a 20-year-old woman from Hoover, and Jordan Cyrus, a 38-year-old man from Decatur, Ga., were taken to Cleburne County Jail. 
According to Turner anything over a kilo of weight in the state of Alabama brings a trafficking charge. A kilo is 2.2 pounds. 
Turner said the marijuana seized was hydroponically grown, which typically has a high THC content. THC is the active ingredient which gives marijuana its narcotic effect. Turner estimates the total value of the marijuana seized to between $20,000 and $40,000, based on a unit value of $2,000 to $4,000 per pound for marijuana of that strength. 
Turner said the driver was also given written warnings for the traffic violations.

140,141,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20130103/News/603239940,Three-week probe nets more than 100 pounds of marijuana,"More than 120 pounds of marijuana has been seized in Etowah County during a three-week investigation by the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, and two people are charged with trafficking in the drug. 
More than 120 pounds of marijuana has been seized in Etowah County during a three-week investigation by the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, and two people are charged with trafficking in the drug.The marijuana was imported from Mexico and stacks of small, compacted bales displayed at a news conference Thursday are an example of why the drug should not become legalized, Sheriff Todd Entrekin said.“Some people think it ought to be legal, but how can you control it?” Entrekin said. “We hope this puts a stop to a lot of the marijuana trafficking in our area.”The wholesale street value of the marijuana is about $250,000, Rob Savage, commander of the Drug Enforcement Unit, said. The retail street value is slightly higher.Marijuana still is considered to be a “gateway” drug to drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine, Savage said.Evidence gathered during the investigation shows the drugs eventually would been in the hands of teens and young adults in Etowah County, he said.District Attorney Jimmie Harp said drugs like cocaine and meth are more serious, but marijuana typically is the first drug someone uses first, especially teens and young adults.“This is causing them to fail when they normally would succeed,” he said.Harp said the two people charged are from the Birmingham area.“This sends a message that we're not going to accept that and we're going to make sure it doesn't cross our borders and reach our community,” Harp said. “I appreciate the hard work of the DEU.”Hunter Epps Waters, 22, Trussville, and Hernandez Soto, 36, Birmingham, were arrested in the Gadsden area, about an hour apart. They allegedly had been business partners in the drug trade about a year, Savage said.Both are charged with trafficking in marijuana. Waters, with a $10,000 bond, had about 45 pounds of marijuana. Soto, with a $50,000 cash bond, had about 50 pounds.The immigration status of Soto, considered a flight risk, is unknown, Savage said. His bond was set higher, Savage said, because “he is a source, not the middleman.”The marijuana was in the compacted bales, but in each arrest already was unwrapped and not hidden. In one arrest, it was in a trash bag in the back seat of a truck. In the other, it was in a grocery bags in the trunk, Savage said.It is believed the bales, with a weight of about 4.5 pounds to 5 pounds, originally were packaged in bulk, tightly wrapped in plastic for concealment, while being brought across the border.Savage said the investigation originally started in western Etowah County near Boaz with the seizure of about 15 pounds. However, the investigation is not related to a recent large marijuana bust in Boaz. Information about that part of the investigation will be presented to a grand jury for possible charges. Gadsden Police Chief John Crane praised the work of the DEU.“This is a prime example of the professionalism and dedication of the Drug Task Force,” Crane said. “This represents hours of work of sacrifice of the agents.”

141,142,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20140627/News/603235512,Synthetic drugs pose real threat,"In the late ’90s and early ’00s, methamphetamine became the big enemy on the drug front. It started with “dirty” low-potency meth cooked in kitchens or small labs and morphed into a mass-produced, high-potency product coming from Mexico, with purity that increased from 40 percent to 90 percent. 
In the late ’90s and early ’00s, methamphetamine became the big enemy on the drug front. It started with “dirty” low-potency meth cooked in kitchens or small labs and morphed into a mass-produced, high-potency product coming from Mexico, with purity that increased from 40 percent to 90 percent.Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit Commander Rob Savage said he sees many similarities in the way the synthetic marijuana market is developing now, and expects synthetics to be the big battle in the drug war for this decade.It’s troubling, because Savage and DEU Sgt. Phil Sims believe people do not understand the dangers of putting these questionable chemical compounds into their bodies.Like meth, Savage said, synthetic drugs, often called Spice or Clone, but with an ever-changing roster of nicknames, are completely man-made. There are no natural components, and no telling exactly what is in a product from one illicit purchase to the next.“You could use something one day without serious problems,” Savage said. “And the next time you could get the same product, with the same packaging, and end up in the hospital or the morgue.“We get the stuff in here and we’re not sure what we’re dealing with,” Savage said. “The person who’s buying it on the street and smoking it certainly doesn’t.”Just a few years ago, Spice started turning up in convenience stores, with packaging designed to appeal to young adults — something that continues now, Sims said, displaying a seized package of “Geeked Up” that looks quite a bit like SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise. In the early days, people knew to ask for “Scooby snacks” to get the drugs.Savage said even though packages billed it as an incense or potpourri product, undercover agents found the sellers were not subtle. There would be a display by the checkout with packets of Spice, and below it glass pipes and steel wool.“Here’s the synthetic and here’s what you use to smoke it,” Savage said.Even though the packages were marked “not for human consumption” the clerks would often tell buyers how to use the product to get high.There was a lot of attention paid then to synthetic marijuana and bath salts, with reports of young people ending up in emergency rooms with hallucinations, psychotic episodes and serious physical damage from using them. Savage said there have been people with renal failure and severe lung damage from the drugs.Sims recalled a case where a man had shut himself off in a room to smoke synthetic marijuana with a 3-month-old baby in the room with him. “The chemicals are in the smoke, too,” Sims said, and that baby was exposed to the harmful effects.It’s a product that was conceived to be a synthethic — and at that time — legal substance that would mimic the effect of marijuana, Savage said. Instead, it’s more like the effect of using PCP or LSD. Alabama “got in front” of the problem in a way, with a law that outlaws the base component in synthetic marijuana “and/or analogs” of that component.Without the addition of the analog language in the law, manufacturers could tweak their chemistry, making minor changes to the compound, and be clear of the law.Savage said local agents had a case that motivated them to want to curb the trafficking of synthetics.“There was a young man who hanged himself about three years ago,” he said. “He was found with a bag hanging out of his pocket.”It contained synthetic drugs the man had bought at a local convenience store.Savage said the note he left for his parents said he couldn’t take the addiction anymore. “This all happened in about two months time,” he said. The Alabama law has taken synthetics off the store shelves.“Now we’re seeing it being imported and sold at the street level like marijuana and cocaine,” Sims said.Narcotics agent Darron Walker tests substances police believe to be illegal drugs. He said the unit tests a lot of synthetic marijuana Gadsden police find in the course of traffic stops or other arrests.In the last decade or so, enforcement efforts against meth have made an impact, Savage said. The price of meth in the area has gone from $800 an ounce to $2,300 an ounce, he said, because policing of it has made it harder to find.But enforcement was only one part of the attack on meth. Education efforts like the Zero Meth campaign that publicized the dangers of using the drug played a role.Savage said he hopes the DEU can help educate people about the dangers of synthetic marijuana now.The agents said they don’t know if the tag “synthetic” creates the perception that these substances are not real drugs. If so, people need to know better.The penalties for synthetics are the same as for other controlled substances.“We charge it as unlawful possession or distribution of a controlled substance (synthetic marijuana),” Savage said.

Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year.Utah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow use of an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns.Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, is confident the Utah and Oklahoma measures will pass.""America's appetite for cannabis is not going away,"" Strekal said. ""We are in the death rattles of prohibition.""Marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before "" including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.Mormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the ""Word of Wisdom,"" which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the ""wise counsel"" of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana.Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana.Advocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the Mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, Schweich said. His Washington, D.C.-based organization helped draft the measure.Unlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own except under limited circumstances, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.""It's a question of compassion,"" Schweich said.Oklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings.Ted Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo "" one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use.Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.""In 10 years, the church may say something different,"" Lyon said. ""This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'""Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.""I think there's some room for interpretation on this,"" said Frodsham.The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.""We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state,"" McOmber said.

Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year. 
Utah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow use of an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns. 
Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, is confident the Utah and Oklahoma measures will pass. 
""America's appetite for cannabis is not going away,"" Strekal said. ""We are in the death rattles of prohibition."" 
Marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before "" including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. 
Mormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the ""Word of Wisdom,"" which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the ""wise counsel"" of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana. 
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana. 
Advocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the Mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, Schweich said. His Washington, D.C.-based organization helped draft the measure. 
Unlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own except under limited circumstances, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November. 
""It's a question of compassion,"" Schweich said. 
Oklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings. 
Ted Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo "" one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use. 
Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits. 
""In 10 years, the church may say something different,"" Lyon said. ""This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'"" 
Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck. 
Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited. 
""I think there's some room for interpretation on this,"" said Frodsham. 
The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO. 
""We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state,"" McOmber said. ""This is an addictive drug.""

145,146,AL,www.gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20120510/News/603236332,Law makes penalties greater for synthetic drugs,"A new law went into effect Thursday that provides greater penalties for crimes related to synthetic marijuana, known as Spice. 
A new law went into effect Thursday that provides greater penalties for crimes related to synthetic marijuana, known as Spice.Mike O'Dell, district attorney for DeKalb and Cherokee counties, said the new law makes it much easier to put a stop to violations related to the drug that has been linked to at least 30 people in DeKalb County being poisoned.Under the law, synthetic marijuana now carries the same penalties as other illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine. “... It greater expands the ability of law enforcement to push forward more aggressively,” O'Dell said.The law adds 30 specific chemicals to the list of controlled substances and makes possession of the chemicals a felony in all cases. Some previous cases were misdemeanors.The new law also creates a Class A felony of trafficking in controlled substance analogs for a person who possesses 28 grams or more of these substances. The minimum sentence is 10 years, and those convicted must serve at least three years and pay a minimum $50,000 fine.DeKalb County Sheriff Jimmy Harris said he is pleased the bill passed.“Our hands were tied,” he said. “We would test one of these products and wouldn't be able to do anything about it.”The synthetic marijuana products already were being removed from stores because of a statewide health warning, but the new law makes the penalties more severe.“It's no longer legal and it's certainly not harmless, and could potentially be deadly,” O'Dell said.Spice typically is sold in small, brightly-colored packages that have names like Good Times, Skyscraper, Crazy Monkey, Sexy Monkey and Bedrock Blend with a photo of the cartoon character Fred Flintstone on the front.Authorities in DeKalb County also are seeing a brownie-like product called a Kush Cake, sealed in brightly-colored packaging, that contains synthetic marijuana, according to Darrell Collins, commander of the county's Drug Task Force.Collins said he believes the new law will make a difference in stopping some of the problems with Spice.“We're going to have a zero tolerance,” he said, “just like we've taken with meth.”A large amount of synthetic marijuana was seized in March at two convenience stores in Gadsden. Thousands of grams of Spice, in small, brightly colored packages, were being sold at the convenience stores. The products appeared to be geared to teenagers and gave a sense that the drug was not bad, Rob Savage, commander of the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit, said.Savage said he is not aware of any reports to law enforcement in Etowah County of any Spice laced with poison. However, the drug has been linked to several suicides across the state. “The issue around synthetic marijuana is there is very little known about the chemical compounds used to make it,” Savage said.The first raids on businesses where Spice and the synthetic cocaine-like product called bath salts were being sold were done in February 2011, and merchants were told to stop selling the products.A state health warning led to the initial raids, but laws later were passed to make synthetic marijuana and bath salts illegal. The law that went into effect on Thursday increases penalties for violations.Savage said there have been very few issues with Spice in Etowah County since the convenience stores were raided in March.“We're going to continue to monitor the compliance with the new laws,” he said. “It's important for people to realize Spice and its analogs fall into the same category now as marijuana, methamphetamine or cocaine and it makes everything related to synthetics a felony.”

146,147,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/bill_would_reduce_alabama_pena.html,Bill would reduce Alabama penalty for marijuana possession,"A bill that would reduce the penalty for marijuana possession in Alabama is scheduled for consideration on Wednesday by both the House and Senate judiciary committees. 
Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, are the bill sponsors. Todd has tried with similar bills for several years to reduce the penalties for marijuana possession. She believes opposition has faded and is optimistic the bill will pass. 
""I haven't talked to one person who is against it,"" Todd said. 
Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, said the bill is intended to keep young people from being saddled with serious criminal records for personal use of pot. 
""No one is talking about legalizing possession of marijuana,"" Brewbaker said. ""But I haven't talked to anybody who thinks hanging felonies on college kids is a great idea because that follows them around for the rest of their lives."" 
Current law says possession of marijuana for personal use is a Class A misdemeanor, which can carry a jail sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $6,000. 
A second offense of possession for personal use is a Class D felony. A Class D conviction can carry a sentence of up to five years, but at least part of that time has to be under community supervision. Most Class D offenders are recommended for probation or community corrections, rather than prison. 
The Todd and Brewbaker bills add a a lower tier. 
Possession of one ounce or less would be a violation -- considered less serious than a misdemeanor -- and would be punishable only by a fine not to exceed $250. That penalty would apply to both a first and a second offense. A third offense would be a violation punishable by a fine of up to $500. 
Brewbaker said he's working with the Alabama District Attorneys' Association on some possible changes to the bill. 
""If I don't get the DAs' support, the bill is not going to move forward,"" Brewbaker said. 
Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said that in practice prosecutors generally seek probation, pretrial diversion, drug court or other alternate penalties for marijuana possession offenders. Ward said that helps make the case for changing the law. But he expects the bill to have opposition and is not sure it will win committee approval. 
""People are scared during an election year that they're going to get called soft on crime,"" Ward said. ""If you argue the merits of his bill, it makes sense."" 
Todd said the deadly problem of opioid addiction is demanding the attention of law enforcement. 
""We need all the resources we have to deal with that and not with a little bit of weed,"" Todd said. 
Todd said she believes the time has come for the bill to pass. 
""This is not as bad as alcohol,"" Todd said. ""We don't want people to use. But it costs the state a lot of money to enforce the possession law."" 
Ward said the Senate is expected to consider the General Fund budget on Tuesday.

147,148,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/04/marijuana_in_alabama_debate_st.html,Marijuana in Alabama debate strikes a chord with AL.com readers,"Discussing marijuana in Alabama strikes a deep chord, with supporters enthusiastic about its possible benefits, and opponents worried that a national trend toward legalization might sweep into the state. 
Already, the Deep South sees the signs, with medical marijuana recently approved in Arkansas and Florida. 
On Feb. 21, AL.com launched a project called ""Marijuana in Alabama"" to assess trends and public sentiment in the state. More than a dozen stories explored issues surrounding changing attitudes and how Alabama handles enforcement of marijuana laws from the courtroom to school hallways. 
AL.com found that Alabama courts are not sending many people to prison for marijuana possession anymore, although police are still making arrests and most of the remaining prison inmates are black. As of October 2016, more than 80 percent of the 220 state prisoners convicted of first-degree marijuana possession were black, according to the Alabama Sentencing Commission. 
Al.com reported that some counties are still imprisoning new mothers who test positive for marijuana and in some cases removing the baby. We found that some colleges arrest students, some don't. We talked to parents using newly allowed CBD oil to help children with seizure disorder and we spoke with people serving life in prison based on Alabama's low thresholds for felony possession. We found the Baptist lobbying group ALCAP is gearing up to lobby against any legalization movement, employing the same moral arguments used to fight against the rolling back of blue law restrictions on alcohol. 
Readers responded with 14,000 comments after the articles and with tens of thousands of shares on social media. We found among Al.com readers that much of the debate focused on whether marijuana was harmful to society or not. Many commenters made the argument that no one has ever died from marijuana. Others argued it leads to drug addiction. 
""Anyone ever had a child hooked on pot?"" one reader commented. ""Mine started at age 13, which led to Xanax and Klonopin. So please don't tell me it's harmless. I have seen the effects and how it shaped his mind. Three stints of rehab to get him off all three. I will never support legalizing it."" 
Other readers had only ringing endorsements for marijuana. 
""Cannabis-hemp is the most useful plant-herb on the planet: food, clothing, shelter, energy, medicine, insights, recreation,"" one reader commented. ""It has been mankind's helpmate and companion since the beginning. Any law against it is a crime against humanity, creation and the Creator."" 
Overall, the responses from AL.com readers clearly favored legalization. Here are some results, with numbers in the chart representing percentages. 
Across the country, the trend toward softer enforcement continues. Kansas City voted April 4 to lower penalties for people caught with small amounts of marijuana, reducing maximum fines from $500 to $25 and eliminating jail time. Under the old ordinance, judges could send someone to jail for 180 days for marijuana possession. 
AL.com readers were also quick to weigh in on poll questions. More than 9,280 readers voted in a poll asking whether recreational marijuana should be legalized: 84 percent said yes. 
In another AL.com poll, more than 6,780 voted on the question of whether or not using marijuana was a sin: 88 percent said no and 8 percent said yes. Asked which was more dangerous, alcohol or marijuana, more than 6,470 readers voted: 91 percent said alcohol was more dangerous. Only four percent said marijuana. On the question of whether marijuana was a ""gateway drug,"" 84 percent of readers said no; only 12 percent said yes. 
These were not scientific polls, but thousands voted and the results were decidedly one-sided. 
Alabama, experts on both sides agree, remains a longshot to legalize marijuana because of its reputation for conservatism and lagging social trends. Yet everyone agrees the idea becomes less farfetched as more states vote to legalize it and as popular opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization. 
The state has already taken significant steps with the passage of Leni's Law and Carly's Law. 
In 2016, Alabama passed Leni's Law, allowing patients who suffer seizure disorders or other debilitating medical conditions to use a product that comes from the marijuana plant. The law decriminalized cannabidiol, derived from cannabis, for those with certain medical conditions in Alabama. That law expanded on Carly's Law, passed in 2014, that authorized a UAB study on using cannabidiol to treat seizure disorders. 
Medical marijuana laws have now been passed in 28 states plus the District of Columbia, including some states in the South: Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana. 
Of those 28, eight states also legalized marijuana for recreational use. Oregon, where marijuana is legal for recreational use, recently reported $5 million to $7 million a month in 2016 in tax benefits to the state. 
Will Alabama, someday, follow suit? 
Many readers expressed that hope. 
""Step up, Alabama, don't be last again,"" one reader commented. ""Fire it up and get that tax money!"" 
Others sounded the alarm. 
""Americans can't even deal with alcohol and they want to introduce another intoxicant for which there are no legal guidelines or laws for driving, work situations and other things,"" another reader commented. 
A complicating matter for the surge in marijuana legalization is the ascension of former U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions from Alabama to U.S. Attorney General. Sessions is staunchly anti-marijuana, but President Donald Trump has said that enforcing federal anti-marijuana laws in states that have legalized marijuana is not a priority. Still, Sessions issued a memo directing the Justice Department to review its marijuana enforcement policy. That could endanger the Cole Memorandum, a 2013 Obama directive to place a low priority on enforcing federal marijuana laws in states where it has been legalized. 
On April 4, the governors of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington wrote a letter to Sessions, urging him to keep marijuana legal in those states where it has been approved. 
U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican from California, introduced the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment prohibiting the Justice Department from interfering with the implementation of state medical marijuana use. It became law in 2014 as part of the omnibus spending bill. 
""The Rohrabacher amendment prevents Jeff Sessions from spending any federal dollars to enforce federal cannabis prohibition in medically legal states, which includes all fully legal states,"" one AL.com reader wrote. ""Reform of cannabis law is not strictly a liberal agenda item; in fact, it is more rightly a conservative one, since it is an issue of fiscal conservatism, limited and smaller government, and less regulation."" 
For marijuana to be legalized in Alabama - either for medical or recreational use - the state Legislature must act. 
For now that seems unlikely to happen. An AL.com survey of legislators shows little interest in marijuana legislation. 
A bill sponsored by state Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, both this year and last year that would significantly reduce the criminal penalties for possessing one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use, has languished without a committee vote. 
As other states begin to reap millions in new revenues from taxing legalized marijuana, Alabama's politicians may become more and more tempted. 
""People in Alabama have been smoking pot for over six decades,"" one reader commented. ""Legalize it. Stop arresting people for possessing a harmless substance."" 
And others still say not here, not ever. 
""I hope Alabama is the last holdout,"" another reader wrote. ""Move to the west coast if you want to smoke it legally.""

148,149,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/nearly_two-thirds_of_americans.html,Nearly two-thirds of Americans say smoking marijuana is 'morally acceptable' ,"Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that smoking marijuana is ""morally acceptable,"" while 31 percent disapprove of pot on moral grounds, according to a new survey released Monday by Gallup 
That's a sharp jump from 2013, when a similarly worded question in a Public Religion Research Institute survey found that slightly fewer than half of Americans said it was morally acceptable to smoke marijuana. 
The shift in moral acceptance of marijuana mirrors the shift in support for legalization over that time period, which rose from 48 percent at the end of 2012 to 64 percent last fall, according to Gallup. 
On the spectrum of morality, Americans now rate marijuana use similarly to gay and lesbian relations, stem cell research or having a baby outside marriage, according to Gallup. It's seen as significantly more acceptable than medical testing on animals, abortion or pornography. But it's viewed as less acceptable than alcohol use, which 78 percent of respondents say is morally acceptable. 
The gap in the acceptance of marijuana and alcohol is driven almost entirely by conservatives, the Gallup data shows. Marijuana and alcohol use are viewed as morally acceptable by large majorities of self-described liberals and moderates - who together comprise about 61 percent of the adult population. Among conservatives, however, 75 percent say drinking is acceptable, while 47 percent say the same of marijuana use. 
While marijuana legalization has enjoyed majority support from Democratic voters since at least 2010, many leading Democratic politicians have been slow to embrace the issue. But there are signs that's starting to change: Earlier this year Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a bill in the Senate that would decriminalize marijuana use at the federal level. 
The Marijuana Justice Act, another Senate bill that would legalize marijuana nationwide and penalize states that refused to do so, has attracted a number of leading Democrats as co-sponsors, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). 
The next big tests of voters' willingness to change marijuana laws will come in November, when Michigan voters will decide whether to legalize the drug and voters in Utah and Missouri will consider medical marijuana measures.

149,150,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/02/legal_marijuana_is_it_coming_t.html,Legal marijuana: Will Alabama be last?  ,"As legalized marijuana spreads across the United States, most observers remain skeptical that recreational marijuana will be legal anytime soon in Alabama. 
""We're the Bible Belt,"" said Gary Hetzel, a retired warden at Donaldson and Holman prisons and now executive director of the Alabama Therapeutic Education Facility. ""We're too conservative."" 
Marijuana activists are hopeful, but realistic. 
""It will be legal here when the people force their elected officials to stop enforcing an obviously failed and disastrous policy,"" said Loretta Nall, executive director of Alabamians for Compassionate Care and founder of the U.S. Marijuana Party, which began as the Alabama Marijuana Party. ""Having been an activist here and knowing how difficult it is to motivate enough people to make a difference, I'll say that I don't see that happening any time soon."" 
Alabama's reputation for conservatism and lagging social trends make it an unlikely candidate. Yet everyone agrees the idea becomes less farfetched each time another state votes to legalize it and as popular opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization. 
""No, I do not think there will be any legalization of marijuana in Alabama,"" said Ralph Hendrix, former program manager for UAB Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities. But he sees the conversation shifting.  ""Marijuana is prolific now; it's just a failed strategy and policy,"" he said. ""The tax revenue could be going toward schools. The medical uses are becoming front and center. There is a lot of evidence marijuana helps veterans with PTSD. "" 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham has been a focal point for research on medicinal uses of marijuana. As medical research delves into the potential benefits of marijuana for treatment of pain and diseases such as cancer, that could shift the discussion even more. 
""I think there's going to be an increasing sympathy,"" said Dr. Bisakha Sen, a professor of healthcare organization and policy at UAB. ""It would first get legalized for medicinal purposes. I would expect that in the next five years. Full legalization could come a few years later."" 
Hendrix noted that research at UAB has been the impetus for drafting legislation about cannabis treatments as early as 1982. That came to fruition most recently with Alabama's two cannabinoid oil laws known as Leni's Law and Carly's Law. 
In 2016, Alabama passed Leni's Law, allowing patients who suffer seizure disorders or other debilitating medical conditions to use a product that comes from the marijuana plant. The law decriminalized cannabidiol, derived from cannabis, for those with certain medical conditions in Alabama. 
That law expanded on Carly's Law, passed in 2014, that authorized a UAB study on using cannabidiol to treat seizure disorders. 
Medical marijuana laws have now been passed in 18 states, including some in the Southern region: Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana. 
More than half of the 50 states now have laws legalizing marijuana for recreational or medicinal uses. 
Since the November election, marijuana has now been legalized for adult recreational use in eight states plus the District of Columbia. 
""I think we're headed in that direction,"" said Jonah Tobin, founder of the Alabama Mother Earth Sustainability Alliance, or MESA. ""Half the country now has medical marijuana. I think it's inevitable."" 
Opponents see the trend and worry. ""I'm concerned about our children,"" said Susan Short, a children's advocate in South Alabama. ""We don't know even know what the science is of the effects on an unborn baby."" 
Many supporters of legalized marijuana worry about the effect new U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will have on drug policy. Sessions, the former U.S. senator from Alabama and longtime opponent of marijuana legalization, could even reverse the trend of marijuana legalization by cracking down on enforcement of federal laws against marijuana in states that have legalized it. 
That would also likely squelch talk of legalization in Alabama. ""I don't think there's a chance with Jeff Sessions,"" Hendrix said. 
The Drug Enforcement Agency could shut down the legal marijuana trade in other states, although it has become big business in many of those states. ""The DEA still considers marijuana a Schedule A Drug, more dangerous than fentanyl,"" Hendrix said. ""A federal crackdown could be problematic for those 24 states. It's still against the law."" 
Marijuana is not a lethal drug in terms of medical effects; legalization could allow focus on fatal addictive drugs, he said. 
""The benefit is we could concentrate on the killing drugs,"" Hendrix said. ""The mortality rates are horrible in Alabama because of the opiate epidemic. Marijuana has its disadvantages, like all drugs do. In terms of harm, it's not as harmful as others. The positive far outweighs the negative."" 
About 47 percent of all adults age 18 and over have used marijuana, according to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency of the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
""It's everywhere in terms of volume,"" Hendrix said. ""We can't arrest our way out of marijuana."" 
Support for legalized marijuana is up to 57 percent, a sign of a dramatic shift in public attitudes over the past decade, according to a survey released in October by Pew Research Center. 
That's flipped from a decade ago, when opinion on legalizing marijuana was nearly the reverse - just 32 percent favored legalization, while 60 percent were opposed. 
Younger adults are driving the change. About 71 percent of millennials, age 18 to 35, support legalization of marijuana, compared to only 34 percent in 2006, the poll shows. 
About 69 percent of police officers say marijuana should be legal for either personal or medical use, according to a Pew Research Center survey of about 8,000 law enforcement officials. About 32 percent said it should be legal for both medical and recreational use; about 37 percent said they favor legalization for medical use only. About 30 percent say marijuana should not be legalized. 
Southern Baptists, the largest religious group in Alabama with more than a million members, and other evangelicals have traditionally opposed the legalization of marijuana. 
""I don't think they've got the votes to get it in the Legislature,"" said the Rev. Joe Godfrey, former president of the Alabama Baptist Convention and now executive director of the Baptist-affiliated Alabama Citizens Action Program, which lobbies against alcohol, drugs and gambling. 
""I'm sure they'll keep pushing until the polls move in their favor. I think what's going to be interesting is to see how Jeff Sessions will handle this. He may crack down on it. In the past he's taken a strong stance against it. That may be what state leaders are waiting for.""

150,151,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/should_we_allow_marijuana_use.html,Should we allow marijuana use in public?,"Despite the fact that recreational marijuana has been legalized in nine states, using marijuana in public is still largely forbidden. Pot advocates say this is a ridiculous provision -- if it's legal to buy, sell and use marijuana, why can't you smoke it in public? But others argue smoking weed in public would normalize it for children, and potheads should stick to lighting up in private. What do you think? 
PERSPECTIVES 
Marijuana is now legal for recreational use in nine states and Washingon D.C., and it's been decriminalized entirely in an additional 13 states. Marijuana advocates say it's high time weed users be allowed to come out of the shadows and smoke in public. 
Not allowing individuals to use pot in public -- while still allowing them to smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol -- adds to the stigma that marijuana is somehow worse for you. If marijuana is legal, it should be treated the same as other legal substances and its users should be allowed to smoke it wherever they please. 
But others argue smoking in public of any kind, especially marijuana, is bad for communities. Smoking outdoors can be a health risk to others, and some believe the normalization of marijuana use in public will mean more children will want to smoke it. 
Marijuana advocates should focus on pushing for legalization and decriminalization, but pushing for smoking in public, on top of that, is a bridge too far for many. Smoke your weed in private and respect the wishes of others who may not approve of your habit.

151,152,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2018/02/how_politics_killed_alabama_ma.html,How seven little men killed Alabama pot bill -- and one man's redemption,"Seven oldish white guys this week killed a bill that would have eased penalties for small-time marijuana possession in Alabama. 
Rep. Jim Hill, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee was one. He was joined by Republicans Dickie Drake, Allen Farley, David Faulkner, Mike Holmes and Tim Wadsworth. 
They snuffed the thing out like a joint at a Tuscaloosa frat party where the cops were knocking on the door. Easy Peasy. 
But nobody killed it more than Rep. Paul Beckman, the Republican from Prattville. He kissed it with death by demanding the bill get a voice vote. It ensured, in that gutless crowd in this election year, it would never make its way out of the committee for a full debate. 
So they killed it. And who can blame them? 
Lawmakers were busy, trying to make sure Alabama's elementary teachers pack heat. They were busy, doing next to nothing to ease Alabama prison overcrowding. 
They had God to invoke. And moralistic pandering to perform. Forget pot. Just be glad they didn't ban dancing. 
Keep in mind we're not talking about legalization, but a bill that would punish those who have less than an ounce of pot with fines instead of jail time. It made sense in a state known for mass producing criminals and stockpiling them in overcrowded prisons that it can't pay for and can't keep safe. 
Rep. Patricia Todd, a Democrat from Birmingham who is not seeking another term, brought it to the House. And Dick Brewbaker, a Republican from Montgomery who is also not seeking re-election, brought it to the Senate, which passed out of committee by a 6-4 vote Wednesday. 
Brewbaker argued that too many potential workers are driven from jobs because they are stuck, as young people, with criminal records that follow them too long. 
""Nobody in here wants to hang felonies or drug conviction misdemeanors on a bunch of college kids,"" he said. ""We're arresting more people for marijuana than opioids."" 
But it didn't make any difference. 
In the end the politics of piety won in a committee. Keep putting people away, because it's the Alabama way. 
Brewbaker insists there's bipartisan support for such a bill, and ""It's going to happen, just a matter of when."" 
Just not now. 
It's no surprise that the bill died, I guess. What was unusual was how Brewbaker broke news of its death. 
He tweeted it Wednesday. Like this: 
""Marijuana reform is probably dead. House bill failed in House judiciary. All that work, up in smoke."" 
Marijuana reform is probably dead. House bill failed in House judiciary. All that work, up in smoke. 
A little humor. A little melancholy. 
What came after, though, was rare. Democrats and Republicans tweeted appreciation for Brewbaker. Not because of dope. Not because they agree with him all the time, but because they saw in him a thing that's rare in Montgomery: Reason. 
As one tweeter wrote: ""This is going to sound crazy coming from a registered Democrat, who doesn't always agree with you...but we need you to stay in the legislature...we have to pass common sense laws to move this state towards progress."" 
Brewbaker replied with one of the most honest assessments I've seen from a sitting politician. 
""I appreciate that, but being in the legislature is bad for people (at least me) spiritually. No one can swim around in that sea of flattery forever and not have it affect them. It's time for me to go. Redemption isn't found in politics."" 
Maybe it's easy to say those things when you no longer need a vote. But it is truth seldom told by politicians, about politics. 
I don't think Brewbaker has to worry so much about redemption. In many ways, he has found it.

152,153,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/fix_the_marijuana_mess_by_lett.html,Fix the marijuana mess by allowing states to sort it out,"Congress simply can't ignore the massive collision about to occur between federal and state laws regarding marijuana. The Obama administration essentially created new federal marijuana policy by refusing to enforce unambiguous federal law. Whether it was a prudent decision or not, Americans in states from Alabama to California relied on that enforcement decision. 
With Attorney General Jeff Sessions poised to more-fully prosecute federal marijuana laws again, Congress has the option of either allowing many Americans to face serious criminal penalties or actually addressing an issue that isn't going away. 
It's time for Congress to deschedule marijuana and let states sort it out. 
No, I'm not calling for uniform legalization of marijuana. I do, however, realize the absurdity of placing Americans in massive criminal jeopardy for conduct their state government approves. 
As a Schedule I narcotic under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), marijuana falls in the most restrictive category. To put this in context, cocaine and opioids are Schedule II. Drugs like Xanax and Valium are all the way down in Schedule IV. 
While it's pretty clear that marijuana probably shouldn't be treated the same as heroin, methamphetamines, or LSD, this isn't a matter of reclassifying marijuana under the CSA. We don't need an additional layer of federal criminal law at all. States are perfectly up to the task of handling marijuana. More importantly, the risk is relatively nominal. Even the Drug Enforcement Agency's own fact sheet notes, ""No death from overdose of marijuana has been reported."" 
States are increasingly capable of regulating marijuana and its derivatives with a wide range of policy responses. A handful of states permit recreational marijuana. 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have extensive public medical marijuana and cannabis programs. 17 states allow use of cannabidiol (CBD) for medical reasons. 
American government relies heavily on our states operating as laboratories of democracy. That's an amazing feature of our republic. We permit social and economic policy experiments without risking the whole country. 
We ought to allow our federalist system of government to work as designed--that means allowing states to enact different policies in response to the same underlying issue. Instead, we're holding on to a crusty ""big government"" paradigm for marijuana that imposes immense criminal liability. 
As California permits recreational marijuana use, we should watch the state's experience and see how it goes. If Reefer Madness consumes the state, then we probably shouldn't follow their lead. 
Descheduling marijuana shifts the locus of regulation; it doesn't force states to legalize anything they'd rather not. It leaves the debate over the right policy to state governments better equipped to respond to the tailored concerns of residents. 
Congress has a clear opportunity to respect varying policies on marijuana across the nation and avoid needlessly putting Americans in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors. If politicians really believe federalism is more important than one-size-fits-all edicts from Washington, here's a perfect opportunity to show it.

153,154,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/05/_not_ready_for_that_how_alabam.html,'Not ready for that': How Alabama Republicans thwarted marijuana decriminalization,"Nine states and Washington, D.C., allow for the recreational use of marijuana. Another 22 states have decriminalized the drug, and public opinion suggests legalization is supported by more than 60 percent of Americans. 
But in the halls of the Statehouse in Montgomery, conservative lawmakers pushed back this past session against efforts to ease up on the tokers. 
Their concerns varied. Ultimately, two bills to decriminalize marijuana possession never made it to either the House or Senate floors for debate. 
Standing atop the anti-marijuana barricade was the House Judiciary Committee, where the Republican majority defeated the only decriminalization action to come before them. 
Rep. Mike Holmes, R-Wetumpka, was one of the ""No"" votes. He said his constituents simply ""were not ready for that."" 
'Major obstacle' 
Future attempts at decriminalization - let alone a full-out legalization effort - are in flux. The two sponsors of the bills introduced this spring rolling back pot penalties aren't seeking re-election: Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham; and Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road. 
""We feel sure someone will pick up where we left off and move it forward,"" said Todd, who has tried for years to lessen the penalties. ""We don't know who that will be."" 
Said Brewbaker: ""There is clear bipartisan support to have a serious look at our marijuana statues."" 
Brewbaker's SB251, which was nearly identical to Todd's HB272, managed to survive committee scrutiny. The Senate Judiciary Committee, with a 6-4 vote on Feb. 21, endorsed it. 
But the bill did not go any further. The House Judiciary Committee, on the same day, shot down Todd's HB272 with a 7-5 decision. All seven ""No"" votes were Republican. Rep. Mike Ball of Madison was the only Republican to vote in favor of Todd's measure. 
To borrow a Cheech & Chong motive title, Brewbaker's Senate bill also went ""Up in Smoke."" 
""There was no reason to move it out when the House Judiciary Committee made (their vote) clear,"" said Brewbaker. 
Under Alabama law, someone who possesses any amount of marijuana for personal use is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine. Those who have been convicted before of possessing marijuana face a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. 
The two failed bills tied the offense levels to the amount of marijuana: 
Brewbaker defended his bill as something that made sense but confronted political obstacles during an election year. 
""I'm not talking about legalization, but if you get caught with less than an ounce of marijuana, the state and taxpayers are better served by imposing a heavy fine than they are with jail time,"" he said. 
He added, ""It doesn't seem to make much sense to me to hang Class C misdemeanors and felonies that will hang around these people throughout their lives."" 
Brewbaker also pitched SB51, which would have raised the amount of marijuana that would label someone as a drug trafficker, soon to receive a mandatory prison sentence. 
Presently, that level is 1 kilo - 2.2 pounds. Under SB25, it would be 10 pounds, the same as in other states, such as South Carolina, Brewbaker said. 
""If they find two full grown marijuana plants in your back yard and the combined weight is over 2.2 pounds, you can be charged with trafficking even if there is no evidence you are trafficking,"" Brewbaker said. ""It's a mandatory three years in prison."" 
Rep. Paul Beckman, R-Prattville, and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Todd's bill went further than Brewbaker's. He said he wished that Brewbaker had kept trying to move SB25 forward. 
""A lot of these offenders are not drug pushers and the bottom line is we don't want to ruin someone's life,"" said Beckman, who said Brewbaker's decision to pull SB51 from consideration was ""premature."" 
""That was Dick's call,"" he said. ""As far as Todd's bill, basically, what it would do is legalize marijuana."" 
Brewbaker said, however, ""I didn't see a whole lot of point to it. That committee is dead set on keeping things the way they are."" 
Said Todd, regarding her decriminalization push: ""I think that many of the members are supportive of it. But they are afraid their constituents will think they are soft on crime, somehow. I think that is a major obstacle."" 
'Against decriminalization' 
None of the states that allow for the recreational use of marijuana are in the South. 
Few southern states have decriminalized the drug as well, though a rash of cities have pushed to roll back penalties. In Jackson, Mississippi, city officials voted unanimously in February to effectively limit the maximum penalty of 1 ounce or less of marijuana to a $100 fine. 
Atlanta approved a similar measure last October. In Nashville, government officials moved forward in 2016 with an ordinance that reduces the penalty for people who are found possessing a half-ounce of marijuana or less to a $50 fine or 10 hours of community service. 
In New Orleans, city officials urged police to spend less time arresting people on simple marijuana possession. Arrests have plummeted: From June 2016 to March 2017, only 1 percent of encounters between police and someone accused of possessing marijuana resulted in an arrest; in 2014, the rate was 72 percent. 
And the Big Easy hosted, for the first time this past week, a three-day marijuana conference. 
Alabama city leaders have pushed to have marijuana penalties relaxed, such as in Tuscaloosa where city leaders urged state lawmakers in December to roll back pot penalties over concerns about jail overcrowding. 
Alabama cities, unlike municipal governments in most other states, do not have home rule powers and cannot make changes without the Legislature's approval. 
Alabama is also among the deepest of the red states, and home to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is leading the anti-pot movement from the federal level. 
Sessions, in January, rescinded guidelines from the Obama administration that allows states to legalize marijuana with minimal interference from federal authorities. Sessions has also raise health and safety concerns about marijuana, claiming that marijuana leads to heroin use. 
Alabama also has among the highest concentration of Christians who identify as evangelical Protestants, a segment that opposes legalizing marijuana, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. 
Among white evangelicals, 60 percent believe marijuana should remain illegal, while only 38 percent back legalization. By contrast, those labeled as ""unaffiliated"" to a religious identity support legalization by a 78-20 percent difference. 
The polling also shows a partisan split. Democrats overwhelmingly support legalization, by a 69-28 percent margin. Republicans, who dominate the elected offices in Alabama, oppose it by 55-43 percent. 
""I get feedback from all 45,000 of my constituents and they are against decriminalization,"" said Representative Holmes, whose legislative district includes Autauga and Elmore counties - two conservative bastions that overwhelmingly backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and supported Republican Roy Moore in last year's special Senate contest. 
'Quantify amount' 
Rep. Jim Hill, R-Moody, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said his decision to vote against the lightening the marijuana law had more to do with a lack of scientific testing for people who are caught by police driving while impaired after smoking marijuana. 
Moody, a former judge, said there are no tests, such as Breathalyzers, that can determine whether someone is impaired from marijuana. 
Police, for instance, can determine someone's blood-alcohol content almost immediately after pulling him or her over for suspicion of DUI. Marijuana use is determined through blood tests, and those tests are not often readily available, requiring police to make judgement calls. 
""I have an issue with allowing a substance in your body that we know impairs you and affects the ability to operate a vehicle,"" Hill said. ""We cannot quantify that amount."" 
Recent national news reports have showcased the concerns about impaired driving in states where recreational use of marijuana is legal. 
NBC Nightly News, this past week, interviewed a Denver police sergeant who told host Lester Holt that authorities are seeing ""more people driving high on marijuana."" Colorado was among the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana in 2012. 
""It can be a little difficult trying to prove someone is driving high and impaired by marijuana,"" Sgt. Rick Coisman told Holt. ""Alcohol is scientific and validated and accepted by the courts. Marijuana, we're just not there yet."" 
A Colorado Department of Transportation survey showed that 70 percent of marijuana users admitted to driving under the influence of the drug at least once during the past year. More than a quarter of those, the survey shows, are driving high daily. 
The Montgomery-based Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, in its research backing decriminalization, cited a National Highway Transportation Administration study and analysis from academic researchers that found, unlike alcohol, there is no clear correlation between specific blood levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the principle psychoactive element in marijuana - and impairment. 
The group also cited a study from the American Journal of Public Health that found no increase in vehicle crash fatalities in either Colorado or Washington, relative to similar states, after they legalized marijuana. 
Hill, though, said he is concerned about DUI instances increasing from marijuana decriminalization, leaving law enforcement without a solution to screen impaired drivers. 
Brewbaker disagrees with Hill's assessment. He said police already have the authority to remove someone who they believe is driving impaired. 
""A cop has to have some reason to pull someone over if they are acting irrationally or are falling asleep at the wheel, there are all sorts of ways,"" he said. ""You don't have to know what is causing the impairment."" 
'Heavy lift' 
Brewbaker and Todd said that Alabama is spending too much time and money on arresting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana at the same time opioid use is fast becoming a top killer. 
Said Todd: ""It's about the amount of resources the state has to pay out on marijuana possession especially small amounts. It takes a police officer's time, and it takes the court's time. We all realize we need to divert those resources to the opioid epidemic."" 
Indeed, an analysis by Alabama Appleseed shows that more Alabamians were arrested for marijuana possession in 2016 than for opioids, cocaine, and synthetic narcotics. 
The group also showed that Alabama spent $13.3 million on the enforcement of marijuana laws in 2010, that enforcement disproportionately affects blacks who are 4.5 times more likely to be arrested for possession than whites, and that the state's laws lack clarity between marijuana possession and distribution. 
Appleseed contends that two people arrested for possessing the same amount of marijuana in Alabama can face different punishments based on the ""subjective decision"" of a government official. 
Frank Knaack, executive director with Appleseed, said the marijuana possession laws are an ""example of the kind of systematic racial disparity"" that exists in Alabama's criminal justice system. 
""Marijuana possession in Alabama for the first offense is a misdemeanor, but the second offense is a felony,"" Knaack said. ""You can have a little amount, if arrested, and that can bring along a felony."" 
Hill, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, said there is little evidence to suggest that simple marijuana possession arrests are crowding Alabama's state prisons. A proponent of drug courts and intervention programs, Hill said most inmates are in prison because of a violent offense and ""not because they were smoking marijuana."" 
Jennifer Kenney, assistant professor at the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Alabama, said she doesn't believe if Alabama decriminalized low amounts of marijuana possession, there will be a ""huge drop"" in the state's overcrowded prisons. 
Kenney, though, believes that Alabama should legalize marijuana possession to help provide medical support for people struggling with crippling opioid addictions. 
She said by taxing marijuana, revenues can be used to help fund programs aimed at getting people help with other drug addictions. 
""It could potentially help the state of Alabama and our budgets if used in a way to actually increase the health of everyone,"" she said. ""People don't understand that marijuana can really help people fight pain."" 
But, she added, ""We are home to Jeff Sessions. He has said time and again, he doesn't see the difference between marijuana and heroin and controlled substance. I think (legalization) is a heavy lift for a place like Alabama.""

154,155,AL,www.al.com,https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/bill_to_reduce_alabama_penalty.html,Bill to reduce Alabama penalty for marijuana possession hits snag,"A move to reduce the penalty for possession of marijuana met resistance today in the Alabama Legislature. 
The House Judiciary Committee voted 7-5 against a bill by Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, who has tried for years to lessen the penalty. 
Todd's bill provides that possession of an an ounce or less would be punishable only by a fine of up to $250. The offense would be a violation, which is less than a misdemeanor. That would apply to both the first and second offense. 
Third and subsequent offenses would still be a violation, punishable by a fine of up to $500. 
Rep. Jim Hill, R-Moody, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he thought the bill went too far in that possession would be only a violation even after repeat offenses. 
""I think we're probably headed toward either some type of either decriminalization or lesser emphasis being placed on marijuana,"" Hill said. ""But it's illegal. And to say that no matter how many times you use it, how many times it's personal use, it never rises to the level of a misdemeanor, I just think that's a mistake."" 
Under current law, possession for personal use is a misdemeanor on the first offense and a low-level felony on the second offense. 
""I'm sad,"" Todd told the Associated Press. ""But it's an election year. And a lot of people who voted no told me to my face that they were going to vote yes. And I think the roll-call vote scared a lot of people (who) don't want to look like they're soft on drugs. But most people sitting there have no concept or understanding of marijuana."" 
A bill nearly identical to Todd's did advance today in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which approved it on 6-4 vote. That bill, by Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Montgomery, moves to the Senate floor. But it would have to also pass the House to become law. 
""Nobody in here wants to hang felonies or drug conviction misdemeanors on a bunch of college kids,"" Brewbaker said. ""We're arresting more people for marijuana than opioids."" 
Sen. Phil Williams, R-Rainbow City, told Brewbaker he would probably filibuster against the bill if it came to the Senate floor. Williams said he has worked as a counselor for people with addictions and said many started out on marijuana. 
Brewbaker said he believed alcohol was more likely to lead to the use of harder drugs that marijuana. 
Voting against Todd's bill in the House Judiciary Committee were Hill, and Reps. Paul Beckman, R-Prattville; Dickie Drake, R-Leeds; Allen Farley, R-McCalla; David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook; Mike Holmes, R-Wetumpka and Tim Wadsworth, R-Arley. 
Voting for Todd's bill were Reps. Marcel Black, D-Tuscumbia; Mike Ball, R-Madison; Prince Chestnut, D-Selma; Merika Coleman, D-Birmingham and Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. 
Voting for Brewbaker's bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee were Sens. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham; Vivian Figures, D-Mobile; Hank Sanders, D-Selma; Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro; Tom Whatley, R-Auburn and Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, the committee chairman. 
Voting against Brewbaker's bill were Sens. Clay Scofield, R-Guntersville; Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham; Larry Stutts, R-Sheffield and Williams.

156,157,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/upshot/its-time-for-a-new-discussion-of-marijuanas-risks.html,It’s Time for a New Discussion of Marijuana’s Risks,"You may reasonably decide the benefits outweigh the harms, but you should know about those potential harms. 
The benefits and harms of medical marijuana can be debated, but more states are legalizing pot, even for recreational use. A new evaluation of marijuana’s risks is overdue. 
Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Medicine and Engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use. At almost 400 pages long, it reviewed both potential benefits and harms. Let’s focus on the harms. 
The greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer, so it’s reasonable to start there with pot smoking. A 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of Cancer pooled the results of six case-control studies. No association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer. Another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case-control studies and could find no link to head and neck cancers. 
Another meta-analysis of three case-control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer. But this evidence was judged to be “limited” because of limitations in the research (all of which was from the 1990s). 
There’s no evidence, or not enough to say, of a link between pot use and esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, penile cancer or bladder cancer. There’s also no evidence, or not enough to say, that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer in any children of pot smokers. (Using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks, as discussed below.) 
Another major risk with cigarettes, heart disease, isn’t clearly seen with pot smoking. Only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks. One found no relationship at all, and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking. But this finding was based on nine patients, and may not be generalizable. 
It also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease. In the short term after smoking pot, a 2007 systematic review found, lung function actually improved. But these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use. Lung function, however, is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome, and what we really care about is lung disease. Once you control for tobacco use, the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal. Almost no evidence is available to link pot use to asthma. 
Driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States. Six systematic reviews were considered of fair or good quality by the national academies, and the most recent one pooled three of the others. It contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants. 
For people who reported marijuana use, or had THC detected through testing, their odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by 20 to 30 percent, the study found. This is, of course, a relative increase, and shouldn’t be confused with the overall percentage chance of getting in an accident, which is much smaller. 
Regardless, driving while impaired is a terrible idea. Although we have good tests to determine if people are under the influence of alcohol, no such tests are currently available for marijuana, making enforcement more difficult. 
Babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight, delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a 2016 systematic review. But there were no links seen for changes in birth length, head circumference or congenital malformations. There’s limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers, and there’s not enough evidence to comment on much else about babies and their outcomes. 
There’s moderate evidence, from many studies, that learning, memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use. There’s limited evidence, however, that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement, employment, income or social functioning, or that these effects linger after the pot has “worn off.” 
The possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated. The most recent meta-analysis found that there’s a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis, specifically schizophrenia. This mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high-quality studies. Another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use and the development of bipolar disorder. Heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts. 
What makes this complicated is that it’s hard to establish the arrow of causality. Are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems? Or are people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot? 
There’s a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances. Some see marijuana as a “gateway” drug, leading to other substance use or abuse. Others see this as only a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well. 
As states legalize the drug for general use, more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy. They smoke more in public, raising worries about secondhand smoke. A two-year-old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes, a greater impairment than from tobacco. This was a study in rats, though, not of humans out in the world. As for risk of a “contact high,” the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible. 
Almost all agree that children should not use pot, but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization. Although this issue has not been studied widely, it’s possible that pot — the THC and the metabolites from smoke — could have an effect on the developing brains of children. These concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly, however, not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while. 
Almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involve smoked cannabis. We know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration. Nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure. 
Many of the harms we’ve discussed are statistically significant, and yet they are of questionable significance. Almost all the increased risks are relative risks. The absolute, or overall, risks are often quite low. 
We haven’t focused on the potential medical benefits here. But many people use pot — even rationally — for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we’ve listed. 
We unquestionably need more research, and more evidence of harms may emerge. But it’s important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared with that of many other drugs, and that marijuana’s effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse. 
People who choose to use marijuana — now that it’s easier to do legally — will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves. 
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a study into the effect of secondhand smoke. The research found that the smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow; the study did not look at lung function.

157,158,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/opinion/marijuana-opiates-jeff-sessions.html,Marijuana Can Save Lives,"This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions paused a discussion of the opioid epidemic to, once again, go after marijuana. He suggested that addictive pain medication wasn’t the only problem and that many heroin addicts start out “with marijuana and other drugs.” 
There is a relationship between cannabis and opioids, but Mr. Sessions has it backward. Marijuana isn’t a gateway drug to opioid addiction; it’s a safer alternative to pain medicines. Mr. Sessions’s vow to crack down on marijuana will only make the opioid epidemic worse. 
We know that 40 percent of all opiate overdose deaths involve a prescription opiate. So having legal access to cannabis as another option for pain relief may actually reduce consumption of opiates. 
I know it sounds counterintuitive, but consider the evidence. To start, a large study assessed the effect of medical-marijuana laws on opiate-related deaths between 1999 and 2010 in all 50 states and reported a 25 percent decrease in opiate overdose mortality in states where medical marijuana was legal, compared with those where it wasn’t. The study found that in 2010, medical-marijuana laws resulted in an estimated 1,729 fewer deaths than expected. 
Other epidemiologic studies found similar results. A study published last year examined opiate-related deaths in Colorado between 2000 and 2015. Researchers compared mortality rates before and after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2014. For controls, they chose two nearby states: Nevada, which legalized only medical cannabis, and Utah, where all cannabis use is illegal. The study found a 6.5 percent drop in opiate-related deaths after recreational cannabis became legal in Colorado. 
Likewise, other researchers examined the link between medical cannabis and opiate use in a group of patients with chronic pain in New Mexico, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis. They reported that subjects who had access to medical cannabis were 17 times more likely to stop using opiates for pain compared with those not using cannabis. 
Because these are all observational studies, they cannot prove a causal link between cannabis use and lower opiate-related mortality. Still, the consistent epidemiologic evidence is hard to ignore. 
Why might cannabis work so well as an alternative to opioids? It does offer some mild pain relief. But more significant, both opiates and cannabis — like all recreational drugs — cause the release of dopamine in the brain’s reward pathway. That signal conveys a powerful sense of pleasure and craving. Thus, cannabis might pre-empt some of the rewarding effects of opiates, decreasing the general desire to use them. 
There is also intriguing preliminary evidence that cannabidiol, a major component of marijuana, can blunt craving in individuals with opioid dependence following a period of abstinence. 
If cannabis were actually a dangerous gateway drug, as the attorney general suggested, it would be very easy to see in the data. We would find that medical-marijuana laws increased opiate drug use and overdose deaths, when in fact just the opposite has happened. 
We would also expect to see a consistent sequence of drug abuse from cannabis to, say, opiates or cocaine, across different cultures. But this is not the case at all. 
For example, in Japan, where marijuana use is relatively rare, 83 percent of people who used recreational drugs did not begin with cannabis. This was true as well for 60 percent of South Africans. 
A more plausible explanation for the common finding that people use a series of recreational drugs is a general propensity for risk-taking behavior, of which drug use is just one manifestation. 
None of this is to say that marijuana is without risks. It certainly isn’t. Cannabis can impair cognition, attention and intellectual performance, though the effects are reversible. And in some individuals who are genetically at risk, it can unleash psychotic states. But there is little evidence that marijuana use increases mortality. 
In contrast, opiate overdose is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing about 91 Americans every day. President Trump has rightly called the opioid crisis a “public-health emergency” but has yet to articulate a real policy or allocate the necessary resources to deal with it. 
At the very least, let’s not spend precious resources on a senseless cannabis crackdown — especially when the evidence suggests that it would only worsen the opioid scourge and cost more American lives.

158,159,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/well/a-perplexing-marijuana-side-effect-relieved-by-hot-showers.html,A Perplexing Marijuana Side Effect Relieved by Hot Showers,"The only way to get relief for the nausea and pain was to take a hot shower. 
He often stayed in the shower for hours at a time and could be in and out of the shower for days. 
When the hot water ran out, “the pain was unbearable, like somebody was wringing my stomach out like a washcloth,” said the 28-year-old, who works as a production and shipping assistant and lives outside Chicago. 
It was nearly 10 years until a doctor finally convinced him the diagnosis was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, a condition that causes cyclic vomiting in heavy marijuana users and can be cured by quitting marijuana. 
Until recently the syndrome was thought to be uncommon or even rare. But as marijuana use has increased, emergency room physicians say they have been seeing a steady flow of patients with the telltale symptoms, especially in states where marijuana has been decriminalized and patients are more likely to divulge their drug use to physicians. 
“After marijuana was legalized in Colorado, we had a doubling in the number of cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome we saw,” many of which were probably related to marijuana use, said Dr. Cecilia J. Sorensen, an emergency room doctor at University of Colorado Hospital at the Anschutz medical campus in Aurora who has studied the syndrome. 
“C.H.S. went from being something we didn’t know about and never talked about to a very common problem over the last five years,” said Dr. Eric Lavonas, director of emergency medicine at Denver Health and a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. 
Now a new study, based on interviews with 2,127 adult emergency room patients under 50 at Bellevue, a large public hospital in New York City, found that of the 155 patients who said they smoked marijuana at least 20 days a month, 51 heavy users said they had during the past six months experienced nausea and vomiting that were specifically relieved by hot showers. 
Extrapolating from those findings, the authors estimated that up to 2.7 million of the 8.3 million Americans known to smoke marijuana on a daily or near-daily basis may suffer from at least occasional bouts of C.H.S. 
“The big news is that it’s not a couple of thousand people who are affected — it’s a couple million people,” said Dr. Joseph Habboushe, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at N.Y.U. Langone/Bellevue Medical Center and lead author of the new paper, published in Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology. 
Others questioned the one-in-three figure, however. Paul Armentano, the deputy director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), said that even with more widespread use of marijuana, “this phenomenon is comparatively rare and seldom is reported” and strikes only “a small percentage of people.” 
And several physicians who routinely prescribe medicinal marijuana for conditions ranging from chronic pain to epilepsy said they have not seen the cyclic vomiting syndrome in their patients, but noted that they typically prescribe compounds that are not designed to produce a high and contain very low amounts of the psychoactive ingredient THC. 
Dr. Habboushe said doctors in other parts of the country may be unfamiliar with C.H.S. or mistake it for a psychiatric or anxiety related syndrome. And even if they are aware of it, many regard it as a “rare, kind of funny disease,” replete with anecdotes of patients who spend hours in the shower. 
But the condition can be quite serious. One 33-year-old military veteran who asked not to be identified by name described bouts lasting up to 12 hours in which he felt “like a puffer fish with sharp spikes was inflating and driving spikes into my spine from both sides. I’ve broken bones, and this blew it out of the water.” 
“I know patients who have lost their jobs, gone bankrupt from repeatedly seeking medical care, and have been misdiagnosed for years,” Dr. Habboushe said. 
“Marijuana is probably safer than a lot of other things out there, but the discussion about it has been so politicized and the focus has been on the potential benefits, without looking rigorously at what the potential downside might be,” he said. “No medication is free from side effects.” 
Patients often arrive at the hospital severely dehydrated from the combination of hot showers and the inability to keep food or liquids down, and that can lead to acute kidney injury, said Dr. Habboushe. 
But since many patients develop the syndrome only after many years of smoking pot, they don’t make the connection with their pot habit and have a hard time accepting the diagnosis. 
The confusion is understandable, Dr. Sorensen said. “Marijuana is viewed as medicinal, and it’s given to people with cancer and AIDS. People know it’s used to help with nausea and stimulate the appetite, so it’s difficult to get patients to accept that it may be causing their nausea and vomiting.” 
It’s unclear why marijuana can produce such discordant effects in some users. But Dr. Sorensen often tells patients that it’s similar to developing an allergy to a favorite food. 
Getting the right diagnosis often takes a long time. The average patient makes seven trips to the emergency room, sees five doctors and is hospitalized four times before a definitive diagnosis is made, running up approximately $100,000 in medical bills, Dr. Sorensen’s study found. 
“They get really expensive workups, lots of CT scans and sometimes exploratory surgery” to rule out dangerous conditions like appendicitis or a bowel obstruction, Dr. Sorensen said. “At the end of the day they’re told, ‘You’re smoking too much pot.’” 
The symptoms of C.H.S. often do not respond to drug treatment, though some physicians have had success with the antipsychotic haloperidol (sold under the brand name Haldol) and with capsaicin cream. 
The good news is that C.H.S. has a pretty simple cure: abstinence. Patients stop having pain and vomiting episodes when they quit smoking, experts say. And if they start smoking again, they are likely to have a recurrence. 
Mr. Hodorowski said he quit smoking once he accepted that marijuana was the cause of his problems, but acknowledges he was in denial for a long time. Now, he says, he’s telling his story so other people can learn from his experience. 
“I hope they’ll be honest with themselves so they don’t have to go through what I’ve been through,” he said. “I’m very lucky to have survived this.”

159,160,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/nyregion/new-york-today-marijuana-history.html,New York Today: A Cultural History of Marijuana,"Good morning on this brightening Monday. 
Will New York be the next state to legalize marijuana? Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s 2018 budget plan calls for a study of the pros and cons. 
If legal weed comes to New York City, it would finally achieve legitimacy in a place with a long, mixed record of tolerance and crackdowns. Here’s a quick spin through the cultural history of pot here. 
• In the 1930s, as authorities nationwide waged war on “reefer madness,” a doctor at the Manhattan Detention Complex urged treatment, not incarceration, for the city’s marijuana “addicts,” including jazz musicians who “find it necessary to take it before playing.” 
•  Pot moved out of jazz clubs and marginalized communities and into mainstream (read: white) culture with the help of the Beat authors. Jack Kerouac, according to his first wife, took his first hit from the saxophonist Lester Young at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem in the early 1940s. 
• The New York Academy of Medicine’s 1944 La Guardia report, commissioned by the mayor, debunked the myth of the murderous marijuana fiend. Researchers found that a typical smoker “readily engages in conversation with strangers, discussing freely his pleasant reactions to the drug and philosophizing on subjects pertaining to life in a manner which, at times, appears to be out of keeping with his intellectual level.” 
• By 1950, cannabis plants grew as tall as Christmas trees in vacant lots and underpasses in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. But a 1951 eradication effort yanked up 41,000 pounds of the plant. 
• One of the first pro-pot marches took place outside the New York Women’s House of Detention in Greenwich Village in 1965, spearheaded by Allen Ginsberg. 
• And in the late ’80s  the underground “green aid” movement, a forerunner to legal medical marijuana, supplied ganja to AIDS patients to ease the effects of the harsh drugs given to patients at the time. 
“There’s no question: New York has played a very important role, historically, as a location for the cannabis phenomenon in the United States,” said Martin A. Lee, the author of “Smoke Signals” and the director of Project CBD, a nonprofit that publicizes research on medical uses of cannabis. 
• The city cracked down again in the 1990s under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose aggressive policing tactics, like stop-and-frisk, disproportionately affected blacks and Latinos and made New York the pot arrest capital of America. 
• Mayor Bill de Blasio — who toked as an N.Y.U. undergrad — promised to cut back on marijuana arrests, but they have barely budged and racial disparities persist. 
“Culturally, New York has been way out ahead of the law when it comes to cannabis,” Mr. Lee said. “But politically, New York is certainly not a pioneer or a profile in courage. Now, it’s more toward the caboose instead of the front of the train.” 
Here’s what else is happening:

In other marijuana news, here are some of your responses to last month’s request for thoughts on legalization: 
For: 
“Not only does cannabis have, almost without argument, various medical uses, but the amount of revenue brought in by taxes on cannabis could help pay for things we obviously are having trouble finding money for: maintenance and repair of New York’s fading and failing infrastructure, homelessness issues, affordable housing issues and drug rehabilitation issues.” 
— Jamie Legon, 66, Morningside Heights 
“Petty arrests for possession of marijuana have disproportionately targeted low-income communities of color for too long. As a step toward making our justice system more fair and modern, let’s rethink how we criminalize drug use.” 
— Dylan Lee, 22, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn 
“Recreational marijuana should definitely be legal in New York. However, we as a society need to have an honest conversation about the pros and cons of using marijuana — there are many. We also need to remove any and all barriers into medical research of the drug by unbiased scientists so that we can improve our understanding of the effects of this substance that so many of us consume.” 
— André Salerno, 32, Williamsburg, Brooklyn 
Against: 
“I am against legalization simply because it smells bad and New Yorkers live and commute in tight spaces. In New York City the skunky stink seeps into my apartment and I can smell it walking on the sidewalk or lingering on the clothes of subway riders.” 
— Marianne Harmon, 41, Upper West Side 
“I am absolutely against America becoming a nation of potheads. We need our critical thinking more than ever now, and marijuana is scientifically documented to slow reaction time and motivation, cause changes in the brain and negatively affect the lungs.” 
— Anne Russell, 80, Wrightsville Beach, N.C. 
“I do not support the legalization of marijuana for a simple reason that the cost treating people with potential side effects of the drug is enormous.” 
— Howard Zhang, 26, West New York, N.J. 
Wait, I’m confused: 
“Oh, it’s not legal in New York? I walk down the street smelling its pungent aroma just about everywhere in the city. You can get it delivered to your home in an hour. Why on earth don’t we legalize it? Everyone would be way happier and more chill.” 
— Joanne Bernbaum, 59, Williamsburg, Brooklyn

162,163,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/well/move/runners-high-marijuana-pot-sports-exercise-weed.html,Turning to Marijuana for a Runners’ High and More,"The ultramarathoner Avery Collins, among the fastest in the world, is not shy about appearing in photographs holding a bong. The first time he tried running after using marijuana, he said, he realized “it allowed me to be very present and not to worry as much about overall times and what’s going on with the run.” 
Mr. Collins, a 25-year-old from Colorado Springs, is one of a likely legion of athletes who use marijuana as part of their training — although he’s one of the few fast enough to get an endorsement deal from an edibles company. 
While there are no statistics about how many runners smoke a bowl before hitting the trail, as Mr. Collins often does, marijuana is the second most widely used drug among athletes after alcohol, according to the American Journal on Addictions. 
Runners say cannabis and cannabis products make their long runs more enjoyable. Many say that pot helps them to recover from hard workouts and races faster. 
“You have two different reasons potentially for using cannabinoids,” said Marcel Bonn-Miller, an adjunct assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who also works with pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit groups doing cannabinoid research. “One is to enhance your ability to train. The other is recovery oriented.” 
On a federal level, the purchase, possession or use of marijuana is illegal, considered a Schedule I drug — in the same category as heroin, LSD and ecstasy. But attitudes about marijuana have been rapidly changing in recent years, with former stalwart opponents to legalization like John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House from 2011 to 2015, announcing on Twitter “my thinking on cannabis has evolved.” Marijuana is legal at some level in 29 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Sixty-one percent of Americans now say marijuana should be legalized, up from 31 percent in 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. 
It’s also not prohibited for recreational use in the eyes of the World Anti-Doping Agency, whose World Anti-Doping Code is used by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee. In 2013, the organization raised the threshold limit of the cannabis metabolite carboxy-THC that could be found in an athlete’s urine from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150. 
That’s significantly higher than levels set by some professional sports organizations in the United States. The threshold is 15 in the National Basketball Association and 50 in Major League Baseball, for example. 
The World Anti-Doping Agency’s decision to raise the threshold “means that athletes using the substance in competition will be detected, while the chances of detecting out-of-competition use,” which is not prohibited, “are substantially reduced,” said James Fitzgerald, senior manager of media relations and communications for the group. 
Studies on the effects of marijuana on athletes are sparse. “Most of the work is, at the moment, observational, looking at people who use and don’t use and comparing them,” said Dr. Bonn-Miller, who is conducting studies on the use of cannabinoids among former professional football players. “There hasn’t been a whole lot of funding for this.” 
A 2017 survey in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport found only 15 published studies that investigated the effects of cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient, THC, on exercise performance. “It is generally considered that THC won’t improve aerobic performance and strength, and my review confirms that impression,” said Dr. Michael C. Kennedy, a cardiologist, clinical pharmacologist and associate professor at the University of New South Wales and St. Vincent’s Hospital Medical School, who conducted the review. 
He doubts claims that it helps with recovery and improves concentration, and says that athletes who tout its athletic virtues are just promoting cannabis use. “It will not make you faster, it may slow you down and certainly should not be used if there is any possibility of heart disease,” Dr. Kennedy said. Indeed, some studies have linked marijuana to hypertension and other heart risks. 
But Dr. Bonn-Miller believes that from a physiological standpoint, the relationship between marijuana use and running makes some sense. “There’s a lot of overlap in terms of the pathways that are activated between what’s known as a runner’s high and the high that comes from THC,” he said. “Both of those involve activation of the endocannabinoid system, so it’s not too surprising that THC might be used to enhance the runner’s high that’s gained from endurance exercise.” 
Runners also report using products with cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana that has shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, for recovery. The CBD is usually applied through an oil. “It lowers the amount of many, many pro-inflammatory cytokines — things that our body makes naturally in response to any inflammation response,” said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Health, who is studying the use of CBD to treat epilepsy. He said that CBD has also been shown to bind to serotonin receptors, “which may be related to its effect as an anti-anxiety agent.” 
Scott Dunlap, a 48-year-old ultrarunner who calls himself a semiprofessional (he has sponsors but also a day job) and who once ran a race in a marijuana leaf costume, says he will use an edible or vape marijuana after a long race. (He tried it once during a run and said he wound up “lost and hungry.”) He doesn’t see using marijuana after running a race as all that different from drinking a beer — except that a lot of races provide beer free. 
The 420 Games, which has events in California, Colorado and Pennsylvania, gives out samples — sometimes marijuana, but more often oils and creams containing CBD — in places where they are legal, though the sponsors say they are not intended to be used at the event. 
“I can honestly say it’s one of my favorite events of all time,” said Mr. Collins, the ultrarunner, who previously served as a spokesman for the event.

163,164,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/technology/marijuana-start-ups-go-beyond-the-simple-joint.html,About That Joint: Marijuana Start-Ups Pass,"The streets of San Francisco have always smelled of marijuana. Yet it’s worth noting that the city doesn’t seem to have gotten much smellier in the new year, after the recreational use of marijuana became legal in California under a law approved by voters in 2016. 
Well, obviously: because nobody smokes marijuana anymore. Everyone’s vaping it. Or eating, drinking, sipping, dabbing, sucking on lozenges, chewing on gum, applying unguents or administering a drop or two of a cannabis-infused tincture under one’s tongue, where it is absorbed into the sublingual artery, within minutes producing an invisible, odorless, private high. 
These are a few of the inventions of an increasingly sophisticated set of marijuana start-ups, which argue that by pushing the industry past smoke, they can make cannabis convenient and ubiquitous — the drug of the future, and the next great American bonanza. 
Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and it is legal for medicinal use in 29 states. The drug remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has signaled a crackdown on the business. Yet growth of the legal marijuana industry keeps beating even its biggest boosters’ expectations; customers in North America will spend more than $10 billion on legal marijuana in 2018 and nearly $23 billion by 2021, projects the ArcView Group, a cannabis-focused research and investment firm. 
That growth is driven, start-ups in the industry say, by a simple idea: The humble hand-rolled joint was holding marijuana back. 
By breaking marijuana free from smoking and its paraphernalia, new delivery methods — especially portable vapes — are transforming the image and utility of cannabis, and helping it grab a mainstream audience. In the booming new market, the drug of lazy stoners is being rebranded by start-ups as the “wellness” drug of tomorrow. It’s a cure-all for an anxious, tech-addled society — a salve for every ailment, a balm for every mood, ibuprofen meets a glass of red wine cut with Prozac and a hint of Deepak Chopra, all delivered to your door. 
“This can be the challenge of cannabis, but also the opportunity — there’s thousands of possible combinations,” said Troy Dayton, the chief executive of ArcView. He pointed to the many different problems that cannabis companies are aiming to treat, from anxiety, insomnia and pain to problems with libido and creativity. “It’s just a merchandiser’s dream.” 
The growth of Eaze, a cannabis delivery start-up operating in the Bay Area and San Diego, underlines the trends shaping the burgeoning industry. When Eaze started in 2014, marijuana “flower” — that is, the green bud you put in your pipe and smoke — made up 85 percent of sales. 
Now flower is down to less than a third of sales. In 2017, flower was usurped by vape cartridges — kind of like e-cigarettes, they use an electronic element to heat a cannabis-infused oil. Because it does not burn organic material, vaping cannabis is considered safer than smoking, just as vaping nicotine is safer than smoking cigarettes. 
“For a lot of new users, the concept of smoking just feels unhealthy to them,” said Jim Patterson, Eaze’s chief executive. 
But vaping has other advantages over smoking. It produces a fraction of the odor, it doesn’t need any real gear, and it’s portable, easily hidden and very easy to use — press a button and inhale. And because cartridges can include flavors and mixes of different cannabis compounds to produce stronger or weaker effects, vapes can be branded and marketed at dozens of customer niches. 
Eaze — which had been offering only medicinal sales until this year, and now sells cannabis for both recreational and medical uses — said that thanks in part to vapes, its sales grew 300 percent in 2017. (It declined to disclose a dollar figure.) By the end of last year, it was doing more than 120,000 deliveries per month. Women made up 35 percent of its customer base last year, compared with 25 percent in 2015. And its fastest-growing age group was baby boomers. 
“The story here is that the average cannabis consumer is becoming the average American,” Mr. Patterson said. 
In anticipation of full legalization, Eaze plastered the Bay Area in marketing, with billboards introducing cannabis as a therapy for several specific ailments: “Hello Marijuana, Goodbye Anxiety” and “Hello Marijuana, Goodbye Insomnia.” Mr. Patterson said the marketing had been paying off; orders have increased threefold since the start of the year. The company, which has raised nearly $52 million from investors, declined to disclose its valuation. 
Another start-up, Cura Cannabis Solutions, an Oregon company that makes vape cartridges, reported similarly robust growth. In December 2016, Cura’s sales were $2 million; a year later, revenue had grown to $7 million a month. 
Cannabis-related start-ups have previously reported trouble finding investors to touch their industry, but Nitin Khanna, Cura’s co-founder and chief executive, suggested that investors’ appetites had turned. “We are currently raising money at a $400 million valuation,” he said. 
Vivien Azer, an analyst who studies the alcohol and cannabis markets at the financial services firm Cowen, said the rising appeal of cannabis was part of a long-term cultural trend. During the last decade, the social perception of marijuana has rapidly improved, to the point that its rise now poses a plausible threat even to the alcohol business. 
“I view alcohol and cannabis as substitutes in the market,” Ms. Azer said. She pointed out that since 2008, there had been a steep decline in the number of 18- to 25-year-olds who reported consuming alcohol in the past year but a steep increase in the number who said they had consumed cannabis. 
The trend is driven by a shift in risk perception. Young people used to think of smoking pot as riskier than alcohol, but in the last decade that idea has flipped. 
“Increasingly young people view alcohol as more risky, and they view cannabis as much less risky,” Ms. Azer said. In a note to investors last year, she pointed out that cannabis use was gaining acceptance among all ages, ethnicities and income groups. Legalization also tends to slash the price of cannabis, further increasing its attractiveness. 
The upshot in her report: Today’s young people are on the vanguard. Cannabis could be on the way to becoming the drug of choice for tomorrow’s America — a future in which lots of us get high, but no one smokes.

164,165,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/us/california-marijuana-san-francisco.html,San Francisco Will Clear Thousands of Marijuana Convictions,"Thousands of people with misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession dating back 40 years will have their criminal records cleared, the San Francisco district attorney’s office said Wednesday. San Diego is also forgiving old convictions. 
Recreational marijuana became legal in California this year, and the law allowed those with prior low-level offenses to petition for expungement, a process that can be costly. 
But in San Francisco and San Diego, people need not ask. George Gascón, San Francisco’s district attorney, said his office would automatically erase convictions there, which total about 3,000. 
An additional 4,900 felony marijuana charges will be examined by prosecutors to determine if they should be retroactively reduced to misdemeanors. 
San Diego has identified 4,700 cases, both felonies and misdemeanors, that will be cleared or downgraded. 
California was far from the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, but it is at the forefront of offering relief to people convicted of offenses that would not get them in trouble today. 
A number of cities even decided to give preference to those who have previous marijuana convictions when giving out licenses to sell it legally. Oakland reserved at least half of its eight annual dispensary licenses for what it calls equity applicants, which include not only those convicted of marijuana-related crimes, but those who live in neighborhoods that had a disproportionately higher number of cannabis-related arrests. On Wednesday, officials there used a bingo machine to choose the four winners among 36 applicants. 
Other places have taken a different tack. In Nevada, Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed legislation last year that would have allowed people convicted of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana to have their convictions vacated, even though that is no longer a criminal offense. 
And in Colorado, it took five years after voters approved recreational marijuana use before the state passed legislation last year that allows people with pot convictions to apply to have their records cleared. That did not occur until after California voters approved their law. 
The result has been legal limbo: People whose behavior would not now be considered illegal are sometimes unable to find work, get college loans, obtain professional licenses, or find decent housing because of the blot on their record. 
Those who argue against expunging criminal records say people who violated the law should live with the consequences, regardless of subsequent legal changes. 
“In all the other states, the process has been messy,” said Robert Mikos, a professor at Vanderbilt University who studies marijuana law and policy. “But whether people agree with what they did or not, California at least addressed it and there’s value in that.” 
Even in California, there is significant variation in how counties are handling misdemeanor marijuana convictions. Some, like Fresno County, are dealing with them on a case-by-case basis, said Steve E. Wright, the county’s assistant district attorney. Jeff Rosen, district attorney of Santa Clara County, said he was working with the local public defender’s office to identify cases. And prosecutors in San Francisco and San Diego have been more proactive, with both cities planning to automatically dismiss misdemeanor convictions and to reduce felony convictions to misdemeanors. 
In San Francisco, Mr. Gascón said he wanted to avoid putting people through a process that he said violates the spirit of legalization. 
“A lot of people don’t even know they qualify, and I don’t think it’s the right thing to do to make people pay lawyers’ fees and jump through a bunch of hoops to get something they should be getting anyway,” he said. 
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which allowed adults 21 and older to buy or possess 28.5 grams of marijuana — about one ounce — or grow up to six plants at a private residence. 
California, where cannabis shops began opening Jan. 1, was the sixth state to allow recreational marijuana, following Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada. Voters in Massachusetts and Maine have approved recreational marijuana, though sales have not started in either state. Vermont legalized pot earlier on Jan. 22. 
In Washington, D.C., cannabis use is legal, but it cannot be sold commercially. 
In Canada, which is moving toward legalization of recreational marijuana this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that for now, the police and prosecutors will continue to treat pot sales as a crime. 
“We recognize that anyone who is currently purchasing marijuana is participating in illegal activity that is funding criminal organizations and street gangs, and therefore we do not want to encourage, in any way, people to engage in that behavior until the law has changed,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters.

165,166,NY,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/nyregion/marijuana-the-signature-olfactory-experience-of-new-york.html,Marijuana: The Signature Olfactory Experience of New York,"A few years ago when I served on the board of the co-op building where I live in Brooklyn Heights — a fact suggesting a degree of squareness so profound it should discredit my authority to go on — my next-door neighbor came to me with recurring complaints that her apartment, at various points, but mostly in the evenings, reeked of pot (that, children, is what we of the Atari generation call it) so intensely that it seemed as if someone had come in and lit up right on her sofa. That her oldest daughter began to worry that she was getting a contact high while she was doing her homework made me despair for a generation and suggested that perhaps a certain unwarranted hysteria had taken hold. Then one night, at a moment of extreme fragrancy, my neighbor texted and asked me to come over and take a sniff for myself, and it seemed as if I had walked into a commune in the Redwoods sometime between the Tet offensive and the presidency of Gerald Ford. 
The situation was especially curious, because no one in my household smoked anything; there was no apartment on the other side and the one directly below was undergoing a renovation and remained empty. My neighbor wondered whether the couple above her on the top floor, friends, were the ones indulging. But they were Holocaust survivors in their 90s. Who was going to tell them to switch to sherry? 
As it happened, the smell was coming from the apartment two floors down, in the line. Middle-aged lawyers were doing the inhaling, and we asked them if they could devise a way, perhaps through better filtering or ventilation, to mitigate the problem. In retrospect this was naïve because so much of the pot commonly smoked today is pungent enough to resist efforts to conceal it. Even when this couple volunteered to stop smoking in their apartment, taking the habit outside instead, the mere fact of the pot lying around the house caused the smell to migrate upward in the building. Eventually they committed to keeping their pot tightly wrapped in the freezer to contain the odor. On several occasions I noticed that after one of them had smoked outside and returned, the elevator in the building retained the fierce smell for a while after. 
This was only to be expected. A friend in a brownstone nearby told me that the smell of pot smoke often traveled into her house through the walls, from the building next door. This might also seem inconceivable until you start reading online reviews of various popular strains, one of which is called Wonder Woman and is described as having “a mostly skunky smell with notes of fruit and jet fuel.” 
The vital work of decriminalizing marijuana has left pot smoke the signature olfactory experience of New York, which is better than rotting garbage on 85 degree days and infinitely preferable, quite obviously, to the tragedy of locking up young black men for a pleasure that white people have long enjoyed with impunity. There was a brief period roughly between 2011 and 2014, after cigarettes were banned in the city’s public parks and plazas and before the strictures around pot smoking began to loosen, when you could amble around the city and pretty much only encounter the smell of smoke when and if you had the misfortune of walking past a fire. But now it is possible to smell pot smoke nearly all the time, on the street, in every neighborhood, no matter the hour of the day. It is unusual to walk five or six blocks anywhere in New York, without getting a blast — a blast that often smells like skunk alone, untainted by scents from the orchard or a tarmac outside a Delta terminal. 
This prevalence is bound to magnify. The state’s health commissioner recently recommended legalizing the drug, and mayor Bill de Blasio quickly followed with an announcement that the city would now forego arresting most people for smoking pot and hand out tickets instead. Many other states have already legalized recreational marijuana use, and Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary for governor, has made the issue a key element of her platform, framing it as an essential means of beginning to redress the dreadful racial inequities in the criminal justice system. 
It may be that the movement to legalize marijuana eventually morphs into a movement to encourage people to smoke less of it. The grounds might be “stench nuisance,’’ a term applied to a cause taken up by reformers in the mid-19th century who created olfactory maps of New York City that identified health threats that were then, ultimately, targeted. Already some research in rats has shown that exposure to secondhand smoke generated from marijuana affects the arteries in ways similar to tobacco smoke. At some point, it is easy to imagine that mothers of 3-year olds will rise up against the perceived tyranny of skunk weed over the stroller. 
It is equally conceivable that neighborhood groups in stodgy places will demand that people limit their sidewalk smoking to liquid pot and odorless vape pens, or if they cannot afford them, the “doob tubes” popular among high school students. These devices, a website devoted to stoner enthusiasms tells us, “make the smell of weed turn into the smell of fresh laundry.” They are fabricated by stuffing “a toilet paper or paper towel roll with dryer sheets or fabric lightly soaked in Febreze.” Smoke is exhaled into it. It is when the city begins to smell like Febreze that we will have reached peak, immiserating sanitization.

Pot smokers on Long Island shouldn’t expect a pass like their New York City counterparts. 
Nassau and Suffolk law-enforcement officials said they intend to keep arresting low-level marijuana offenders even though the city is backing off because of a wide racial gap in arrests. 
The counties will change direction only if Albany changes the law to address the disproportional impact on minorities. Like the city, Long Island’s arrest rates for marijuana possession are far higher for African-Americans and Hispanics, records show. 
For Nassau and Suffolk police commissioners, the decision to stand firm on making marijuana arrests is clear-cut: It’s their job. 
“The law in place is the law we enforce,” Nassau’s Patrick Ryder said in a statement. 
“The Suffolk County Police Department is responsible for enforcing all laws on the books and will continue to carry out that responsibility by arresting people who violate the law,” Commissioner Geraldine Hart said. 
Practicality is also a consideration for the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office, which works with a patchwork of law enforcement agencies. 
“Unlike New York City, Nassau has not only our countywide police department, but also many municipal departments and, absent legislative direction, uniform policymaking is challenging,” said spokesman Brendan Brosh.

Suffolk District Attorney Timothy Sini didn’t return requests for comment. 
Last week, the Manhattan and Brooklyn district attorneys said they would stop prosecuting possession and smoking violations in the interest of fairness. 
“The dual mission of the Manhattan DA’s office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.” 
The policy pivot reflects New York City’s growing awareness of racial disparity in marijuana arrests: African-Americans and Hispanics accounted for 86 percent of the arrests for marijuana possession, records show. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday he will take steps to prepare for the “likely” legalization of recreational marijuana in the city. He will order the NYPD, which is currently holding a 30-day working group looking at its marijuana policing methods, to stop arresting New Yorkers who smoke pot in public and to instead issue summonses. 
On Long Island, arrest rates for marijuana possession are four times higher for minorities than for whites — five arrests for 10,000 whites and 20 arrests for 10,000 nonwhites, records show. 
The District of Columbia and nine states, including Massachusetts and Vermont in the Northeast, have already legalized recreational marijuana use and the movement is gaining momentum in New York. 
About a month ago, Democrat Cynthia Nixon made marijuana legalization the top policy priority in her bid to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. She cited the racial disparity in prosecutions. 
After Nixon’s announcement, Cuomo said his administration would produce a study on legalization this month. The governor previously called marijuana a “gateway” drug and opposed legalization, but since has softened his stance. 
Several lawmakers in Albany support a bill stuck in committee and some rank-and-file Democrats are calling for the state party to adopt a pro-legalization stance at its convention Wednesday and Thursday in Uniondale. 
To Garden City defense attorney Steve Epstein, the county-by-county approach to enforcement is deeply flawed. 
“It’s unfair to have two sets of rules — one for New York City and another for Long Island,” Epstein said. “We need statewide policy.” 
Relaxed enforcement has the support of Jeffrey Reynolds, an addiction expert and president of the Mineola-based Family and Children’s Association. 
Reynolds would like to see any savings from fewer marijuana arrests poured into drug education and prevention programs. 
“We need a comprehensive approach where we address the public health risks of marijuana without arresting people for holding a dime bag,” Reynolds said. 
Melissa Moore of the Drug Policy Alliance welcomes New York City’s enforcement retreat but called it a “bandage on a gaping hole” that fails to permanently remedy racial disparities in low-level drug arrests. 
Even misdemeanor arrests for marijuana possession can keep young people from getting jobs or housing. A conviction could lead to the revocation of a student loan or could be considered a violation of immigration status, said Moore, the alliance’s deputy state director. 
“This is a systematic issue which requires a systematic solution,” she said.

Polling finds support among New Yorkers for the legalization of pot.       Photo Credit: Getty Images / Ethan Miller 
Under New York State law, possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana in a public place is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by 3 months in jail. Public opinion in New York, though, is increasingly leaning toward legalizing possession, as well as the sale of marijuana for recreational use. 
The trend appears inevitable, but if we don’t want the time in transition to be utterly chaotic, jurisdictions should come to a common understanding on how to enforce the existing laws while the debate about changing them takes place. 
New York’s legalization of medical marijuana in 2014 went off without a hitch. A recent Quinnipiac poll found New Yorkers support legalization by a margin of nearly two to one. And many politicians in New York are riding along with the tide toward acceptance, arguing for full legalization soon, and decriminalization now. There is another compelling reason to act quickly on the state law while also exercising discretion on current enforcement. An analysis of crime statistics shows a tremendous racial disparity in the prosecution and sentencing for minor marijuana charges while usage rates in the overall population show no difference. On Long Island, the rate of arrests of minorities for possession of marijuana is quadruple that of whites. The cars of minority drivers are more often stopped and searched by police than those of white people. Since their cars are more often searched, illegal drugs are more often found. In New York City, the rates are similarly skewed, even though they are generated more by searches of people on foot. 
The State Legislature wraps up business in Albany next month, so it’s unlikely there will be a change this year despite the growing pressure. And it’s better governance policy that the issue gets debated during the campaigns for statewide office, as well as State Senate and Assembly, that will be decided in November. 
Last week, the district attorneys of Manhattan and Brooklyn announced that they would no longer prosecute possession and smoking violations. Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio instructed police to stop making arrests for smoking marijuana in public, telling them to instead issue summonses. 
But the other three boroughs have not yet said they will follow Manhattan and Brooklyn on prosecutions. And the police commissioners of Nassau and Suffolk counties say they plan to keep arresting low-level marijuana offenders as long as the law remains unchanged. 
Such uneven enforcement creates the potential for a person traveling across the metropolitan area to repeatedly cross in and out of areas where possessing a couple of joints is alternately criminal and acceptable. That makes a mockery of our laws and law enforcement. 
The illegal sale of marijuana has to be prosecuted. So does driving under the influence of the drug, which should be treated the same as alcohol or other drugs. But arresting and prosecuting people for possession, an act which is expected to be legal soon, would serve little purpose even if we could enforce the laws without discriminatory results.

178,179,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/legalizing-marijuana-1.18292574,New York should move carefully on legalization of marijuana,"What was once unthinkable is becoming unstoppable.

In 2000, when a Pew Research Center poll found 30 percent of Americans supported the recreational use of marijuana, broad legalization of the drug seemed unthinkable. In January, that same poll found 61 percent of Americans supported legalizing the use of marijuana. 
What was once unthinkable is becoming unstoppable. But if legal pot is not properly taxed and regulated, the consequences would be unbearable. 
Last week was an extraordinary one for legalization momentum. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, once an opponent, said he would introduce federal legislation to decriminalize marijuana and leave regulation to the states. Passage would mean that federal prosecutions and persecutions of users and suppliers, still an issue even in states that have legalized, would no longer be a threat. 
Former House Speaker John Boehner, who in 2011 said he was “unalterably opposed” to legalization, last week announced a change of heart. He has joined the board of Acreage Holdings, a multistate marijuana corporation, and says ending the federal prohibition would allow scientific study of the drug’s benefits, assist veterans who can be helped by its use and stem the opioid epidemic. President Donald Trump is signaling he won’t let anti-pot Attorney General Jeff Sessions crack down in the nine states where recreational use is legal, or the 20 more that allow medical marijuana. And the increasing benefits felt by older Americans suffering from chronic pain, cancer, glaucoma and other illnesses have created an unexpected source of support. 
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s gradual conversion from opposing legalization to supporting it is accelerating. Democratic primary opponent Cynthia Nixon’s embrace of full legalization is central to her campaign. Even presumptive Republican candidate Marc Molinaro supports the expansion of medical marijuana and wants to see how full legalization plays out in neighboring states.

The public’s change of heart is justified by data. The path for states that have passed full legalization, while not without bumps, has generally been smooth. There have been no huge surges in crime or addiction, and a growing body of evidence shows opioid use and related deaths decline in states that legalize medical marijuana and drop even more in states that allow recreational use. Tax revenue has flowed in, with marijuana sales generating $250 million for Colorado in 2017. Pointless prosecutions that often disproportionately punished minorities have stopped. 
Schumer’s bill and similar ones in the House are not likely to pass yet. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans, and while pro-marijuana sentiment is rising among GOP voters, it’s not yet great enough to force leaders to support legalization. 
Right now, the most important decisions are being made at the state level, but it’s becoming clear that federal decriminalization also will be necessary to address some needs. 
It’s not a coincidence that the push for full legalization in New York is heating up as legal retail sales creep closer. On New York’s border, Massachusetts stores will throw open their doors on July 1 to sell pot. Maine voters just approved full legalization, and the state is working out the details of retail sales. And New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is pushing for legal sales and use. 
A February Siena College poll found that a majority of voters in every region of New York, where a medical marijuana law was passed in 2014, support full legalization. And there is no reason New York should let its marijuana money flee the state, as it did with gambling revenue for decades. 
But New York needs to do this right. Strict controls over sales and harsh penalties when they are broken are needed to keep legal marijuana from minors. There needs to be a consensus about licensing and zoning for sales. Where should stores be allowed? Would communities have a say in whether they host stores, and how many? Taxes on marijuana, while not punitive, must raise enough money to fund programs to prevent opioid addiction and expand treatment. Dosage information must be reliable so users don’t inadvertently consume too much. 
Police need laws and tools to detect and arrest people who drive stoned. That would be easier with diagnostics and standards funded and developed nationally, as with blood-alcohol levels. Federal legalization could smooth that path. Removing marijuana from the federal drug prohibition schedule would finally allow rigorous research to determine what illnesses and symptoms it alleviates, and what provable health effects its use causes. That information would mean marijuana could be prescribed by doctors for military veterans who need it to treat post-traumatic stress disorder and other issues. Now, Department of Veterans Affairs doctors can’t legally recommend it, much less prescribe it, and have VA benefits pay for it. When it’s a proven medical remedy, Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance also should cover it. 
American opinion on marijuana has shifted because it has become clear that the war on marijuana is more damaging to society than its consumption. Change is coming quickly, but there is still time to do legalization right. 
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this editorial gave the wrong date for legal sales of marijuana in Massachusetts. It has been updated with the correct date.

179,180,NY,www.newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/cuomo-administration-legal-recreational-marijuana-1.19286315,Official: Health Dept. report will back legal recreational pot,"The state health commissioner says his department will release a long-awaited marijuana report in the coming days.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s health commissioner said Monday his agency will soon issue a report recommending the legalization of recreational marijuana, possibly setting the stage for a dramatic policy shift for the governor. 
Dr. Howard Zucker said the health department will release a long-awaited marijuana report in the coming days. 
“We realized that the pros outweigh the cons and the report recommends a regulated, legal marijuana program be available to adults in the state of New York,” Zucker said at a news conference in Brooklyn. 
If the governor backs the report’s recommendation, it would complete an extraordinary shift for the Democrat. It also would put him on the same page as Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist who is challenging Cuomo for the Democratic nomination from the political left. And it would align New York with a growing number of states that have legalized marijuana. 
Another Cuomo election opponent, Republican Marc Molinaro, said the health department’s recommendation was more about Cuomo “sprinting to the left” in an election year than a serious consideration of the issue. 
When he took office in 2011, Cuomo initially opposed the legalization not only of recreational marijuana but also of medical marijuana. Pushed by state legislators, he negotiated a new medical marijuana program in 2014, but still opposed recreational marijuana, calling it a “gateway drug.” 
In January, Cuomo proposed that the state budget fund a study about potential legalization. Though the provision wasn’t included in the budget adopted in March, Cuomo said in April the health department would conduct the research anyway, saying the “facts” had changed and noting the many other states that have decriminalized marijuana. 
Meanwhile, Nixon on April 11 called for legalization of the recreational use of marijuana. She said it was a “social justice” issue and noted the disproportionate number of blacks and Latinos prosecuted for marijuana use compared with whites. She also said it could raise revenue for the state.

Zucker didn’t disclose any further details on what his agency would recommend, such as limits on businesses and tax rates. He didn’t specify a minimum age, but said legalization would be only for “adults.” 
Asked for a rationale in the policy switch, Zucker likened it to research driving changes in medical policy. 
“This is no different than medicine,” Zucker said. “We have new facts. We have new data.” 
Nor was it clear if, how and when the administration might follow through on Zucker’s recommendation. The state Legislature is set to adjourn for the year on Wednesday, meaning no meaningful action could likely occur until 2019 — after this year’s elections. 
Cuomo’s office limited its comments to saying it would “review the report when we receive it.” 
A Nixon spokeswoman said Zucker’s announcement was being used to “distract” attention from opening arguments Monday in a public corruption trial that focuses on Cuomo’s high-profile economic projects. Nixon aide Lauren Hitt also said the policy shift comes too late for many New Yorkers. 
“One year after calling marijuana a ‘gateway drug,’ it shouldn’t have taken Cuomo eight years and #TheCynthiaEffect to understand the ‘facts have changed,’” Hitt said, referring to a term activists have used to describe Cuomo’s shifts to the left in this election year. “Cynthia believes legalizing cannabis is not enough and we must also expunge people’s records and create marijuana equity, setting aside half of its marijuana licenses for low-income residents who have been convicted of a marijuana-related crime or who live in communities disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.” 
The Molinaro campaign questioned whether Zucker was providing political cover for Cuomo. It noted that Zucker previously was deployed by Cuomo to write a study that ultimately led the governor to banning — just after the 2014 election — hydraulic fracturing for natural gas. 
“There are serious questions to be answered about marijuana,” said Molinaro spokeswoman Katy Delgado. “They should be answered by serious people without a political agenda.”

It is well-established but worth repeating that the War on Drugs is a disaster for everyone it touches. The mass incarceration, gang activity, persecution of people of color, lost tax revenue, and blocked research, all perpetrated by the war, make it one of the nation’s greatest self-inflicted wounds. 
Now we are seeing a wave of marijuana legalization, beginning in the West and continuing in the East. After Colorado and Washington led the way, Massachusetts, Maine and Vermont followed suit. Now nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized adult recreational marijuana use. 
The benefits brought on by legalization - studies have shown it to reduce crime, curb opioid abuse, decrease teen marijuana use and raise property values - could help catalyze similar initiatives in other states. Michigan is voting on legalization this November, which could pave the way for Pennsylvania, Illinois and Minnesota. 
Attention is now on New York and New Jersey, which together represent 29 million people. These two states could be a tipping point for legalization, but that will only occur with substantial and sustained support from the people who live there. 
New Jersey has been progressing toward legalization since the election of Democrat Phil Murphy to the governor’s mansion. Lawmakers are hoping to pass a legalization bill this summer, but it’s not clear whether they have the necessary votes. And while some New Jersey cities welcome the arrival of cannabis, about 17 have banned or restricted it within their borders. 
In New York, a recent State Department of Health report calling for legalization has moved the needle, and provided some cover for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to embrace the issue as he tries to head off a primary challenge from progressive Cynthia Nixon. The two states are also pressuring each other as they compete to see which will be the first to score the windfall of cannabis enthusiasts arriving on the PATH train or taking the Holland Tunnel. 
Citizens in these states who want the laws to change must make their feelings known. Legislators need to feel some heat from their constituents, because many would be content to leave this issue in limbo. 
“If this came up as a voter referendum, it would pass overwhelmingly,” New York state Sen. Diane Savino, who authored the state’s medical cannabis bill, told me. “But when you work through the legislative process, there are some members who still aren’t sure.”

Cuomo, with his re-election and potential presidential run at stake, may be particularly sensitive to political pressure. 
Even in states where legalization has occurred, differences in how programs are run can have a big impact. For instance, provisions that bar felons from establishing cannabis business licenses can perpetuate the inequalities of the War on Drugs. These can be mitigated with equity provisions, like the one in Massachusetts that provides training and technical assistance and waives fees for cannabis business license applicants from communities disproportionately harmed by the War on Drugs. 
Nationwide legalization of marijuana is now likely inevitable. But injustice prolonged is injustice perpetuated. It’s time for New York and New Jersey to advance the issue through legalization. That will increase the pressure on other states and make it more likely that the next Democratic president will soften the federal restrictions around criminalization. 
The stakes are high for swift and well-executed legalization in these two states.

Construction on a new medical marijuana dispensary in Carle Place could begin within weeks, now that the dispensary has been granted a parking variance from the North Hempstead Board of Zoning Appeals. 
The last hurdle preventing Massachusetts-based PalliaTech from breaking ground on the project is securing a building permit, for which it has been waiting since December. 
PalliaTech president and CEO Michelle Bodner said the company was “committed to being a good neighbor.” 
“We are thrilled to be one step closer to opening in Carle Place and helping patients in Nassau County and Long Island who are suffering from serious, chronic conditions and need the relief that our pharmaceutical-quality medical cannabis products provide,” she said. 
The Curaleaf facility would be the second one in North Hempstead Town and Nassau County; the other one opened in January 2016 in Lake Success. 
PalliaTech has proposed opening a dispensary with the trade name of Curaleaf at a 3,000-square-foot former optical office at 255 Glen Cove Rd. ERG Commercial Real Estate, the property’s owner, would continue to operate its office on the building’s second floor. 
Town spokeswoman Carole Trottere confirmed Thursday that a building permit had not yet been issued. A PalliaTech spokeswoman said the company expects to have the permit in the next few weeks. 
PalliaTech’s application was denied in February by the town Building Department because it did not meet the parking requirements mandated under town zoning laws. On Wednesday, the town’s Board of Zoning Appeals approved PalliaTech’s request to have five fewer parking spaces than the required 45 spots.

A PalliaTech spokeswoman said Thursday that the target opening date had since been revised to late summer. 
As of May 8, 54,256 patients were registered in New York State to be treated with medical marijuana, which requires a doctor’s certification for individuals with eligible serious illnesses. More than 1,600 practitioners, such as physicians and nurse practitioners, are registered with the program. There are 19 dispensaries open throughout the state, which has authorized doubling the number of dispensaries to 40 — two each are planned for Nassau and Suffolk. 
The state Department of Health has also authorized a third Nassau location, which has not been announced, to be operated by Manhattan-based Fiorello Pharmaceuticals. Suffolk, which has one dispensary in Riverhead, will also be getting two new dispensaries, to be operated by Syracuse-based New York Canna and Purchase-based Valley Agriceuticals.

Medical marijuana is a potent method of treating chronic pain in older adults who had been relying on opioids, a Long Island doctor has found in a research project of people mostly in their 60s who suffered from a wide range of pain syndromes. 
The survey by Northwell Health coincides with the New York State Department of Health declaring opioid use a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. People can be weaned from opioids by treating chronic pain with medical cannabis, state health officials said Tuesday. 
Local doctors already have compelling evidence that medical marijuana helps wean chronic pain patients from heavy-duty narcotic medications. 
“What we found was that the patients overwhelmingly had a reduction in their pain with medical cannabis and a reduction in their use of painkillers of all kinds,” said Dr. Diana Martins-Welch, a co-author of the study. She is a specialist in geriatric and palliative medicine at the health system’s division in Manhasset. 
She and her colleagues conducted a survey of medical marijuana users between the ages of 61 and 70 and found that 65 percent of them reported relief from chronic pain caused by a wide range of conditions. 
Some patients had osteoarthritis, others had painful hips and knees that, for a variety of medical reasons, could not be replaced with artificial joints. Still others suffered from spinal stenosis, which generally occurs when the spaces within the spinal column narrow significantly, putting pressure on spinal nerves. The result is excruciating, round-the-clock pain for which many doctors routinely have prescribed an opioid.

Despite the favorable findings, more studies of medical marijuana and its pain-relieving properties are needed because not enough information is contained within the overall medical literature on which doctors rely, Martins-Welch said. 
Medical students receive no instruction on medical marijuana, Martins-Welch said, adding that much of her own knowledge was self-taught. 
“The big difference between opioids and medical cannabis is that there is an anti-inflammatory component to cannabinoids,” she said, referring to the medically active constituents of cannabis that are capable of relieving inflammation, which underlies many pain syndromes. 
The New York State Department of Health, meanwhile, has announced that it will develop a regulatory amendment to the state’s Compassionate Care Act and add opioid use as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. That action ultimately could help wean patients off opioid drugs by using medical cannabis to treat chronic pain. 
“The opioid epidemic in New York State is an unprecedented crisis, and it is critical to ensure that providers have as many options as possible to treat patients in the most effective way,” Dr. Howard Zucker, the state’s health commissioner, said in a statement. 
Dr. Maria Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine for the Northwell Health network, says finding alternatives to opioids is critical. 
“From an advocacy point of view I am trying to make it easier for doctors to prescribe other pain-management methods so that we can use opioids more responsibly. It’s easier for me to order a fentanyl patch, which is an opioid than it is to order a lidoderm patch, which is not an opioid,” she said. 
Insurance coverage is another conundrum, Martins-Welch added Tuesday. 
Most health insurers will cover the cost of an opioid medication, she said, but will not cover the cost of medical marijuana, which at about $200 to $300 per month, is a prohibitive amount for some patients to pay.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo talked about tackling some of the issues facing Long Island in his 2019 budget overview, delivered on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018. On his list were proposals for $150 million to treat the Northrup Grumman plume and $29.9 billion for roads and bridges. (Credit: News 12 Long Island) 
ALBANY — Some members of Long Island’s state delegation supported Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s proposal to study legalizing marijuana  in the state, but stopped short of saying they would endorse legalization. 
Cuomo floated the idea Tuesday during his budget address of funding a Department of Health-led study to look at the economic, health and criminal justice impacts of legalizing recreational marijuana. He said the study should also look at the effects of legalization in Massachusetts —  and possibly New Jersey —  on New York, as well as any future federal intervention. 
“This is an important topic, it is a hotly debated topic —  pardon the pun —  and it’d be nice to have some facts in the middle of the debate once in awhile,” Cuomo said. 
Cuomo did not address details on the potential study, including how much it would cost and how long it would take, during his speech. No actual funding for the study was included in Cuomo’s 2018-2019 budget proposal, though the budget bill dedicates “so much funds as shall be determined necessary” by the state health commissioner. 
The state legalized medical marijuana in 2014. 
Sen. Elaine Phillips (R-Flower Hill) said her office has conducted a survey in her district and her constituents don’t appear to support recreational marijuana use. However, she said she was open to further research. 
“I think we need to do a study,” she said. “I think it’s a smart way of going about it.” 
Assemb. Christine Pellegrino (D-West Islip) said she was “encouraged” by Cuomo’s plan.

“I think it is time to look at what the economic impact of legalization could mean for the budget and we could have a real debate on what legalization could mean,” she said. “Let’s really have a full conversation with real information.” 
Assemb. Brian Curran (R-Lynbrook) said that while he supported medical marijuana use, he still opposes recreational use, “regardless of any type of revenue” it could bring to the state. 
“The bottom line is, in my opinion, it’s still a gateway drug that has resulted in significant problems” in states that have legalized it, he said. 
Sen. John Brooks (D-Seaford) said he has always supported medical marijuana and agreed with Cuomo’s idea to study recreational legalization. “I don’t have a problem with our looking at it,” he said. 
Assemb. Dean Murray (R-East Patchogue) said while he doesn’t support recreational use —  he does support medicinal marijuana —  “it’s not a bad idea to do the study.”

ALBANY -- State lawmakers reached an agreement Thursday that would make New York the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the system would prohibit the smoking of marijuana and would allow use only in connection with about 10 diseases and syndromes. The drug would be available only through other forms, such as edibles, oils and vaporizers. Physicians and patients would face criminal penalties for abuse of the system. 
The program wouldn't start for at least 18 months. Five regulated manufacturers would be selected to grow the drug in the state and operate four dispensaries each. The drug would have to be cultivated and distributed all within New York borders, and non-state residents wouldn't be eligible for treatment. The state would assess a 7 percent tax on manufacturers. 
Additionally, the legislation would authorize medical marijuana for just seven years, with an evaluation after that. Further, it gives the governor power to abruptly stop the program if he sees abuse or other problems, based on input from the state Health Department. 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a former opponent of medical marijuana, called that a ""fail-safe"" provision that made him comfortable enough to back the legislation. 
""Medical marijuana has the possibility to do a lot of good for a lot of people who are in pain and who are suffering and are in desperate need of a treatment that can provide relief,"" said Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for re-election this fall. ""At the same time, it's a difficult issue because there are also risks that have to be averted -- public-health risks, public-safety risks -- and we believe this bill strikes the right balance."" 
Smoking for medical purposes could be allowed in the future, if the Health Department and State Legislature agree. 
The state Assembly expected to approve the medical marijuana bill after midnight. The State Senate, where the issue is more contentious delayed a vote until Friday.

The agreement was struck after several days of intense negotiations by legislators and vocal rallies at the State Capitol by medical marijuana supporters. Activists blamed Cuomo for stalling until the final days of the session and accused him of trying to run out the clock. But in the end the governor won many of the concessions he was looking for, most significantly banning smoking, gaining the power to end the program and cutting the number of eligible conditions in about half. 
The measure was almost two decades in the making for Assembly Health Committee chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan). ""You know, it's really gratifying after all these years to be able to help some very seriously ill people,"" he said. 
His efforts received a big boost this year. Statewide polls this election year showed broad support. Another key was the frequent protests and personal stories told by people, many in wheelchairs and many of them children, suffering pain and chronic seizures that could be eased by marijuana. 
""I'm gratified that legislation is going through,"" said Missy Miller, an Atlantic Beach resident who has been among a regular group of those lobbying at the Capitol for months. ""While I'm very happy that we're going to have a program, I'm petrified that my son is not going to live long enough to benefit."" 
Miller said she's tried almost 20 medications to ease the seizures endured by her son, Oliver, 14, who has a severe form of epilepsy and uses a wheelchair. 
She said children in other states, such as Colorado, have slowed their seizures through medical marijuana. 
State Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island), the bill's prime Senate sponsor, had called Cuomo's demands ""non-starters"" on Monday. Three days later she was satisfied with the compromise. ""You can't stand in the way,"" she said, noting there are alternate delivery methods. "" . . . If that [smoking] becomes the only thing that stands in the way, you can't say no to that. It just doesn't make any sense."" 
Savino said the list of eligible conditions is sufficient for now, but allows for expansion. 
She said the legislature's bargaining to make the new law's effective date 18 months after the governor's signature was important because without a start date the marijuana industry might have ""taken a pass on New York.""Sen. Phil Boyle (R-Bay Shore) had offered an alternate bill that banned smoking among other things. He applauded the compromise. 
""This measure will provide relief for people with legitimate medical needs while guarding against individuals diverting toward recreational use,"" Boyle said in a statement.

186,187,NY,www.nydailynews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/ny-sports-savino-marijuana-legalization-20180619-story.html,"With New York a step closer to legalizing marijuana, cannabis movement in sports may gain momentum","With apologies to “Sex and the City” actress Cynthia Nixon – who is running against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic primary this fall – another state politician wants to take credit for leaning on Cuomo to legalize marijuana. 
“There’s only one woman in this state who moved Cuomo and marijuana, and you’re looking at her,” New York State Senator Diane Savino told the Daily News at the recent Cannabis World Congress Expo at the Javits Center. “It’s not easy.” 
Savino may finally see the fruits of her labor pay off, however, after Monday’s announcement by New York Department of Health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker, who said that a report compiled by the agency “concludes the pros of a regulated (marijuana) program outweigh the cons.” Zucker said the report will be presented to Cuomo for review. 
Savino sponsored the Compassionate Care Act, which established a “safe and regulated” medical marijuana program in New York, and Cuomo enacted the legislation in 2014. But Savino says more work in the cannabis movement needs to be done, and she’s continued to push the conversation forward, imploring her lawmaker peers in Congress to reschedule marijuana and urging Cuomo to accelerate legalization of marijuana in New York. 
Savino, who represents the 23rd Senate District that includes parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, has also been a strong ally for sports figures like former Jets and Broncos defensive lineman Marvin Washington, advocating for cannabis as a safe alternative to opioids to treat chronic pain and other sports-related injuries. 
“There’s only one woman in this state who moved Cuomo and marijuana, and you’re looking at her. It's not easy.” 
“Senator Savino probably doesn’t get enough credit. She’s been pushing this issue since the beginning,” says Washington, the co-founder of IsoSport, which is part of parent company Isodiol, producers of hemp-based products that use cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating component of cannabis. “Cannabis can tackle the opioid crisis. Whenever cannabis is introduced to a community, opioid use goes down.” 
Washington has for years voiced his belief that the NFL and the union need to embrace the cannabis movement and remove marijuana from the NFL’s banned substances list. Marijuana is considered a drug of abuse in the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the players and owners. An NFL spokesman told The News that commissioner Roger Goodell's stance on marijuana hasn't changed - last year Goodell said ""our medical community is evaluating"" medical marijuana use to treat football-related injuries. 
“I know it’s a priority for the union to establish a sensible cannabis program for its players before they negotiate a new CBA with owners,” says Washington. The league’s current CBA expires in 2021. “The union will argue two points – the benefits of cannabis use as a neuro-protectant, and its use as an alternative to opioids.” 
Both Washington and Leonard Marshall, the ex-Giant defensive lineman who leveled 49ers quarterback Joe Montana in the 1991 NFC Championship game, are pitchmen for cannabis products that don’t contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the component in cannabis that gets individuals high. 
Marshall, 56, says his life has changed dramatically for the better after he began using Elixinol products, which use cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating element of cannabis. 
“I still deal with my issues as it relates to (brain injury), and all the symptoms - headaches, short-term memory loss, mood swings, erratic behavior,” says Marshall. “Once I started using Elixinol products, I started seeing a change in the way I did things. I said to myself, ‘No way this could be as good as the way I feel right now. I feel like I could go back out there (on the field) now and do my thing.” 
Marshall says he has urged former teammates and opponents who battle opioid addiction to switch to the safer, and less addictive CBD. 
""It just so happens I (recently) saw two (former teammates), both dealing with the same disconnect,"" says Marshall. ""They said, 'Man, you look great.' I said, 'You know why? I'm finding a way to deal with this crap that we've been delivered playing professional football.’"" 
If Cuomo enacts a law legalizing marijuana, Savino says several hurdles still remain – the need for more dispensaries so individuals can access the product, and establishing the appropriate tax policies for a legal, regulated marijuana program. Savino adds that after the Supreme Court earlier this year paved the way for legal sports betting in states, there shouldn’t be any hesitation by politicians to move on the cannabis issue. 
“If we only decriminalize marijuana for personal use, we’re still buying it from criminals. We need to create a legal, regulated market. We need to establish a program that arrives at the right number of licenses so we don’t have too much product,” says Savino. “And we have to regulate it and tax it. We don’t need to derive a certain amount of money to depress use and raise revenue for healthcare initiatives because we don’t have the same effect on tobacco. 
“We have to be thoughtful about it. We’re creating an industry that within four walls of our state is legal, but once you cross the border (into New York) is illegal,” adds Savino. “All these problems could be solved with a federal program – but I don’t hold out much hope for that.”"

188,189,NY,www.nydailynews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-health-department-marijuana-legal-20180618-story.html,New York State Health Department to recommend legalization of marijuana,"The state Health Department is about to recommend that New York legalize recreational marijuana use. 
State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker revealed Monday that a soon-to-be-released report by his department on marijuana will say that the Empire State should join the nearly 20 other states across the nation that have legalized recreational weed use. 
“We looked at the pros, we looked at the cons,” Zucker said during a Brooklyn news conference. “When we were done, we realized that the pros outweighed the cons and the report recommends that a regulated legal marijuana program be available to adults in New York. 
Zucker did not provide any further details, saying only that the report will be released “soon.” 
In a statement issued later,Monday, Zucker said the report was being “finalized” but also “concludes that should a regulated program be implemented, special consideration will need to be given to a number of factors including the age of who can purchase marijuana, who can grow and distribute it, the location of dispensaries, and at what rate the product would be taxed.” 
Zucker added that “the report raises a number of thoughtful questions and we look forward to delivering it for Governor Cuomo’s review.” 
Gov. Cuomo, who had previously opposed legalizing recreational marijuana, tasked the Health Department in January with studying the issue of possible legalization, noting that Massachusetts and other nearby states were also taking steps to make the drug legal. 
Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said “we will review the report when we see it” and declined to comment further. 
Regardless of the report’s recommendation, it is unlikely the state will take any action to legalize marijuana this year. The Legislature is scheduled to end its annual session on Wednesday, and the GOP-controlled state Senate has already said it will not take up any marijuana legalization legislation this year. 
“I am highly disturbed by this,” State Sen. Fred Akshar (R-Binghamton), co-chairman of the Senate's Task Force on Heroin and Opioid Addiction, said about Zucker’s remarks. “It could have profound public safety impacts.” 
Advocates for marijuana legalization, however, cheered Zucker’s comments and urged the Cuomo administration and lawmakers to move forward. 
“We know that a majority of New Yorkers support marijuana legalization and this is the time for the governor and policy makers to get in line,” Melissa Moore of the Drug Policy Alliance. 
Actress Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor and has made marijuana legalization a central plank of her campaign, took credit for pushing the administration into it’s new view on pot and accused the governor of using the issue to distract voters from the just-begun trial of a key aide on corruption charges. 
""After the governor allowed our state's marijuana laws to criminalize communities of color for eight years, it is the most disgusting form of irony that the governor is now using marijuana to distract from a corruption trial of a close associate,” said Nixon spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. “One year after calling marijuana a ‘gateway drug,’ it shouldn’t have taken Cuomo eight years and #TheCynthiaEffect to understand the ‘facts have changed.” 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Marcus Molinaro also blasted Zucker’s comments as a ploy by Cuomo to satisfy left-leaning voters. 
Molinaro spokeswoman Katy Delgado said Cuomo “just had his hand-picked 'Doogie Howser' rubber stamp another decision that has less to do with science and everything to do with politics.” 
Zucker, meanwhile, also announced Monday that the Health Department was advancing new regulations that would allow medical marijuana, which is already legal in New York, to be used as a substitute for prescription opioids. The goal, officials said, is to reduce opioid dependence. 
“The opioid epidemic in New York State is an unprecedented crisis, and it is critical to ensure that providers have as many options as possible to treat patients in the most effective way,” Zucker said. “As research indicates that marijuana can reduce the use of opioids, adding opioid use as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana has the potential to help save countless lives across the state.” 
Currently, medical marijuana is legal in New York for about a dozen ailments and conditions, including chronic pain; posttraumatic stress disorder; cancer; HIV and AIDS; Lou Gehrig's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis, and some spinal injuries. 
State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would also allow medical marijuana to be used as a treatment for opioid addiction.

A video posted Friday on Instagram shows two men brazenly divvying up a quantity of marijuana on the back of an NYPD patrol car — the third video posted in the last week of police being disrespected while on the job. 
The video, taken in July at the Bushwick playground on Knickerbocker Ave. in Brooklyn shows a man putting a digital scale atop the cruiser’s trunk and weighing the weed while the other records. 
“You, you want an eighth?” one man asks the other as a cigarette dangles out of his mouth. 
They discuss how many grams of weed they are splitting before the short clip ends. 
The patrol car from the 83rd Precinct appears to be parked and unoccupied. No police officers are seen in the video — although some cops say the disrespect for the NYPD is palpable.

A post shared by  NYC - MEMES - VIDEOS - HUMOR (@newyorkcityuncut) on Aug 17, 2018 at 2:19pm PDT 
“This is an all time low,” said a high-ranking NYPD officer who saw the video. “The department has to step up now. They’re selling drugs on the back of a police car!” 
Another police official said the video was most likely recorded when the cops assigned to the cruiser were out of the vehicle on a job. 
The video was posted on the Instagram site NewYorkCityUncut. 
David Jiminez, who was given video credit, said the clip was recorded “for laughs” and was in no way meant to disrespect cops. 
“Someone was killed in the park a few days prior and everyone was uptight about it, so I thought it would be a good way to break the ice,” he said. 
Jimenez said he believed the NYPD left the unoccupied squad car at the park as a deterrent. 
“I wasn’t disrespecting anyone. I appreciate everything the NYPD does for the good of the community,” Jimenez said. 
No money wasn’t exchanged in the video, so it wasn’t a criminal act, Jiminez noted. 
An NYPD spokesman said the department was reviewing the video to determine where and when it was filmed. 
“The incident is under investigation,” the spokesman said. 
A post shared by 🇭🇹TRIPPY🇭🇹🐐 ROOTS FROM HAITI (@trippy_nyc) on Aug 13, 2018 at 3:36pm PDT 
The new clip comes two days after a viral video was posted of a man cursing out Sgt. Freddy Lopez at the 28th Precinct station house in Harlem. 
The minute-long rant, recorded on Monday, shows the man going off on a foul-mouthed tirade at Lopez, who warns him that he is barred from filming inside the police station. 
A video showing cops getting heckled and cursed out of a Bronx building after responding to a call was posted Aug. 8. 
The officers “exercised discretion and restraint” by not taking action in response to the heckling, the NYPD said in a statement. 
Police union leaders were stunned by the treatment their members received. 
Edward Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said Thursday that the disrespectful videos “come from a lack of leadership” at police headquarters. 
In a letter to NYPD Police Commissioner James O’Neill, Mullins said that the videos show “the lawlessness and complete lack of respect for police officers that has been so blatant under your tenure is no longer restricted to the streets.” 
Assistant Chief Patrick Conry, a police spokesman, responded to Mullins letter, writing, “The Police Commissioner is out each and every day, talking to cops across the Department about their needs and concerns, and hearing from cops directly about the challenges they face on the job.” 
“The truth bears no resemblance to the fiction in this letter, which should be rejected by everyone in the real world,” he wrote."

Becomes second country in world to legalize sale of weed,"Canada’s Senate gave final passage Tuesday to the federal government’s bill to legalize cannabis, though Canadians will have to wait at least a couple of months to legally buy marijuana as their country becomes the second in the world to make pot legal nationwide. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government had hoped to make pot legal by July 1, but the government has said provincial and territorial governments will need eight to 12 weeks following Senate passage and royal assent to prepare for retail sales. Trudeau’s government is expected to decide a date that would legalize it in early or mid-September. 
“It’s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana — and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,” Trudeau tweeted. 
Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade. 
Canada is the largest developed country to end a nationwide prohibition on marijuana use. In the U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States’ biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan. 1."
191,192,NY,www.nydailynews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/legalizing-pot-fun-stanky-smoke-article-1.3998945,"STASI: Legalizing marijuana can be fun for all, just keep the stanky smoke to yourself","How is it that the very people who can smell a cigarette from 25 feet and start waving their arms and complaining that their air is being polluted are all for legalizing weed so it can conceivably be smoked anywhere? 
So should pot become the new single-malt scotch — the hipster must-have at the fanciest dinner parties? Yes. And no. 
For one thing, scotch doesn't stink up the joint like a joint does — even when people get stinking drunk. If you live in an apartment building, pot — especially skunk weed — smells like somebody left a dead forest creature in the garbage room, which leaves the hallway air stanky for hours. 
Yet if you listen to New York pols, you'd think weed was the panacea for crime, unhappiness, and racial inequality since more people of color get arrested for toking up in public than white hipsters. So they're playing the race card to get pot legalized. 
Do any of these people actually live in apartment buildings? Pot smoke stinks up the halls, seeps into adjacent apartments, even stinks up the elevators when weed smokers get in. Worst of all, it forces parents of babies to stuff towels under their doors to keep their infants from getting contact highs. 
So how is it that it's OK to complain if someone smokes a cigarette, but it's not cool to complain about weed whackers whose smoke fouls the air and violates others' right to live in a clean-smoke-free space? 
I would have liked to have met the guy who first convinced people that setting fire and inhaling burning leaves — no matter what kind of leaves — was a great idea. Hey, lets set this plant on fire and smoke it? Yay! 
Look, I'm all for legalizing marijuana — just not violating everyone else's space with smoke and endangering the health of children in nonventilated spaces. It's not fair if the choice is either opening windows during icy, freezing nights or letting your infants be exposed to pot fumes. 
But in reality we ain't there yet. Proof of that is State Sen. Liz Krueger's sponsored ""marihuana regulation and taxation act,"" which stresses how African-American and Latinos have been targeted for pot arrests, yet ironically enough uses the ancient, virulently anti-Mexican spelling of the ""marihuana"" taken from the Marihuana Tax Act of the 1930s, according to Smoke Signals by Martin Lee. 
Lawmakers should sign a bill similar to Colorado's where you can't use marijuana in public places, but it's legal (and fun) to eat it, infuse it, drink it, moisturize, bathe in it, or whoop it up like Whoopi Goldberg with her cannabis-infused salves, balms and edibles elsewhere. 
Of course, eating it in cakes, cookies, brownies, candy, pulled pork and mac and cheese to name a few, as they do in Colorado, is the perfect solution because you get to feed the marijuana munchies and get high at the same time. 
Unfortunately you might also get fat from too much pulled pork and candy, which would cause the same people who gripe about cigarette smoke to gripe about calories. 
Aaron Schlossberg, the so-called racist lawyer, is many things, but a racist? Not necessarily. Screaming at people for speaking Spanish makes him a xenophobe, a person who fears and loathes anything/anyone foreign. 
Does he fear the loss of identity? Is he aggressive in his desire to eliminate foreigners who he thinks are here illegally? Clearly. But for that, you gotta check off the xenophobe box. 
Is he a Trump wannabe who threatened to call ICE on people speaking Spanish because he immediately assumed they were illegal immigrants living off his taxes? For that, check off the Trump true believer box. 
Is he a racist who deserves to be disbarred, as some lawyers are demanding, for mouthing off at people at a takeout joint for not speaking English and — like Trump — insulting them for perhaps being overweight? Not so fast. 
To be disbarred, Schlossberg probably would have to be determined to have committed moral turpitude, which is, according to Miriam Webster Legal, ""an act or behavior that gravely violates the sentiment or accepted standard of the community."" 
We may hate it and hate him for it, but does yelling at employees and patrons to speak English and put down the sandwich gravely violate community standards? 
Check the bigot box please, for someone who won't tolerate other's beliefs, language, or background. And also the idiot box for wearing that wool watch cap in May. 
But if every lawyer who is an idiot or a bigot was disbarred in this country, we'd lose half the attorneys, which may be a good thing, but still ... 
Meantime, attorney Michael Cohen whose picture will be replacing the ""moral turpitude"" definition in Webster's for paying hush money to porn stars and pregnant Playmates, and attempting to sell influence to the White House still has his law license. 
Schlossberg doesn't need to be disbarred. Why not leave it to his clients to decide his fate? 
Not since Henry VIII defied God and the Pope to marry Anne Boleyn has a red-haired royal been this hot, handsome and — whew! — lustful as Prince Harry was when he looked at Meghan Markle. The second he lifted her veil the temperature in that old church went up a few hundred degrees. Was it hot in there or just me? 
And not since Anne Boleyn, has a bride defied every custom to marry into the weirdos of Westminster. 
She's American, she's biracial, she's a ""commoner,"" she's an actress, she's older than her prince, she was raised by a single hippie mom with a nose earring, and she's divorced. What about any of that is ""common?"" 
And as radical as it was for Henry VIII to marry Boleyn in secret, it was almost more so for Harry to marry a very American goddess in public, who put her African-American roots on full display as she joined the whitest, most tradition-cloaked family on Earth. 
Mostly, though, the person who deserves praise for making her girl into a wondrous woman is Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland. Despite what the religious right would have you believe, you don't have to have a traditional family to raise great kids who are unconventional, unafraid and yes, most un-common. 
Keep your thoughts and prayers to yourself you phony pro-gun politicians. Your thoughts and prayers are as blatant an act of cruelty as a serial killer sending flowers to the funerals of his victims. 
You NRA-loving elected officials may not have pulled the trigger personally at Santa Fe High School, but you put the guns into the hands of the 17-year-old (whom I will not further publicize by naming him) who did. 
There has been on average, one school shooting a week this year and 101 mass murders so far. 
So save your thoughts and prayers, and instead save our children with gun control legislation that we all can live with. Your right to bear assault weapons doesn't trump (nor ""Trump"") our children's right to stay alive. 
We haven't had a controversy split the country like this since the is it brown-or-is-that-blue-dress. The yanny-or-laurel controversy began when an 18-year-old kid recorded the vocabulary.com voice saying ""laurel,"" which millions took for ""yanny."" The White House even weighed in, taking the-er, un-Presidented step of actually joking. Sourpuss Sarah Huckabee Sanders quipped, ""Clearly you're getting your information from CNN cause that's fake news"" and The Donald saying he heard ""covfefe."""
192,193,NY,www.nydailynews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/side-effects-legalizing-pot-article-1.4002044,The side effects of legalizing pot ,"President Ronald Reagan often told a joke about a psychologist who takes a little boy into a room that is piled to the ceiling with manure. To the doctor's shock, the child dives into the fetid pile and starts happily digging with his bare hands, explaining to the startled grownup: ""There must be a pony in here somewhere!"" 
That punch line — a wry warning about the limits of optimism — reminds me of the politicians driving New York's headlong charge into full marijuana legalization. 
There might be a pony in here somewhere. But it could also just be a stinking pile of crap. 
Too many city and state officials don't have answers — and rarely seem curious about — basic questions of how to safeguard public health and safety after legalization. We don't have firm answers about how to determine safe dosages, labeling and licensing that must accompany the legal sale of pot over the counter. 
That has not stopped activists and pols from cheerleading for full legalization, or simply accepting it as inevitable. 
Mayor de Blasio has announced that the NYPD will drop a longstanding policy of arresting people for smoking marijuana in public. Sen. Chuck Schumer has vowed to push for legislation that would decriminalize pot at the federal level, allowing individual states to work out regulations. 
Gov. Cuomo has signaled he is about to drop his longstanding skepticism about recreational use. This week's state Democratic convention will reportedly include a resolution that formally commits the party to full legalization. 
That isn't surprising. A recent poll suggests 63% of New Yorkers favor legalization, the highest level ever recorded, and about 2 to 1 over the 32% who oppose it, which makes the idea politically irresistible in this election year. 
But this is a case where pols seem to be consulting the polls rather than the professionals. 
""Unfortunately, science and medicine was not at the forefront of any policymaking here,"" says Yasmin Hurd, a professor of neuroscience, psychiatry and pharmacology who runs the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital. 
Hurd told me the rush to legalization has outstripped what we know about the downsides of marijuana use. 
""Millions of people in the U.S. have a clinical diagnosis of cannabis use disorder. It's always shocking that people don't realize that you can become addicted to marijuana,"" she told me. ""Different people have different vulnerabilities; it's not that everyone who smokes will become addicted. But definitely the increased frequency of use, especially earlier teenagers, young children — the earlier they start using, the higher the concentration of THC they use, all enhance addiction vulnerability."" 
On the law enforcement side of things, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. took it upon himself to do what Albany lawmakers ought to do: He canvassed cops and prosecutors in states that have already legalized pot, to learn from their mistakes. 
""The takeaway from our visiting all those states is that it's very important to go through this process in an orderly and comprehensive way at the front end,"" he says. ""If we do as a state, to go toward legalization — and I favor that — it's actually going to get much more complicated as opposed to easier."" 
One example, says Vance, is the question of people growing small amounts of pot for personal use. At what point can cops ask to enter a home to verify how much weed a person has? One what basis could a judge issue a search warrant? 
New York history includes some striking examples of well-intentioned government plans spewing awful, unintended consequences. In the 1960s and '70s, the deinstitutionalization movement led to the wholesale closure of large, poorly run mental health asylums — leaving us with thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers living on our streets and concentrated in even less caring institutions like Rikers Island. 
And a hasty legislative sprint in 1973 — a year in which New York City saw 1,600 murders — gave us the harsh, destructive Rockefeller drug laws, with mandatory minimum sentences for possession of even tiny amounts of drugs. The laws wreaked vast havoc and injustice on thousands of families for decades before they were repealed. 
We could be poised to make another big mistake. 
""There's no drug on this planet that doesn't have side effects, especially as the dosing increases,"" says Hurd. ""Never before did the public vote on whether a particular thing is medicinal. This is the first medication we're doing that way."" 
That doesn't mean we shouldn't legalize. But it does mean we should do it thoughtfully and mindfully, based on facts.

193,194,NY,www.nydailynews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/war-pot-article-1.3995772,End the war on pot: We welcome the push to legalize and regulate marijuana,"After many decades of treating as a crime the personal possession and use of a drug that is a negligible threat to public safety, New York is awakening to the folly of — and racial disparities widened by — its approach. 
We are part of this awakening, which is why we welcome the push to legalize and regulate marijuana. By every honest measure, the substance has more in common with alcohol and tobacco than it does harder drugs that are rightly illegal. 
Which is not to say we endorse vaping or toking, or that government should. Legalization can coexist with stigmatization, especially for young people, for whom drug use and abuse is disastrous. 
But continuing to turn the punitive gears of the criminal justice system against 50 people per day in the five boroughs for so much as touching a drug that countless adults use harmlessly in the privacy of their own homes does not serve New York. 
It wasn't supposed to be this way. In 1977, New York decriminalized possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana, making it an infraction with a $100 fine. 
In the intervening 40 years, hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested. Police in the five boroughs continue to make some 17,000 arrests annually for pot possession. Though that's down 40% since 2013, due in large part to a rise in criminal summonses, it's still high. 
And despite the fact that research shows marijuana is used in about equal numbers by whites, blacks and Latinos, blacks and Latinos make up 86% of arrestees. Those two groups account for just 51% of the city's overall population. Even the NYPD's chief of crime control strategies has said this gulf ""should be troubling to anyone."" 
While it's true that arrests are often driven by calls to 311 and 911, analysis by the Daily News this year showed the association to be far weaker than the city claims. 
The New York Times matched ethnically different neighborhoods with almost identical complaint levels — and found that the predominantly white and Asian neighborhoods generally saw orders of magnitude fewer arrests than the predominantly black and Latino ones. 
This stubborn racial enforcement disparity points to a fundamental question: why it makes sense to treat marijuana use as a nail to be hit with the hammer of cuffs, cops and courts, saddling individuals with arrest records and sometimes, though infrequently, jail time for partaking. 
Indeed, New York already permits medical marijuana, an acknowledgement that under careful controls, the drug can have therapeutic benefits. 
Nine U.S. states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, California and Alaska, have fully legalized marijuana for recreational use. New Jersey is leaning strongly in the same direction. 
Where the drug has been legalized, fears that taking sales out of the black market and into the open would lead to a surge in violent crime and drug use have not materialized. 
There are trends worth worrying about, and learning from, such as an apparent rise in pot-related DWIs. But the sky has not fallen, or even noticeably darkened, anywhere that marijuana has gone from being a criminally forbidden substance to a taxed and regulated one. 
By the same token, it is crucial to make clear that legalization advocates oversell their product with the suggestion it will eliminate stubborn policing disparities. 
No state that allows small amounts of marijuana to be sold and held for personal use permits public smoking, which remains anything from a non-criminal ticket to a criminal misdemeanor. 
In other words, it is properly an offense to be enforced, and that enforcement may prove racially disparate, following differences in behavior. So, too, would black-market sales remain against the law. 
One alternative to legalization is decriminalization. Manhattan DA Cy Vance and Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez call for declining to prosecute pot possession while keeping it illegal on the books. While tempting, this could create a patchwork of enforcement whereby the same offense is treated radically differently across New York jurisdictions. 
We've gained little, and lost plenty, in waging this misbegotten war. It's time to try another way."

Nine out of every 10 people arrested by the NYPD for marijuana possession in the first six months of 2018 were black or Hispanic, according to the report released by the Police Reform Organizing Project. 
The report concluded that out of the 6,604 people arrested in the period, 93% were New Yorkers of color. 
“Arrests for marijuana remain in the thousands every year and are now the third-most-common NYPD arrest,” said Robert Gangi of PROP. 
""The racial bias grows more stark, despite research and experience demonstrating that white people use and sell marijuana in proportions and numbers equal to or greater than African-Americans & Latinos.” 
Meanwhile, 87% of those arrested for any misdemeanor offense were black or Hispanic, a proportion similar to that of the same period in 2017, PROP said. 
Even as arrests for transit fare evasions dropped sharply, from 10,950 in the first six months of 2017 to 4,321 in 2018, the stark racial disparity remains the same. Just over 90% of those arrests involve New Yorkers of color. 
Gangi called for “real decriminalization” of the NYPD’s policy on marijuana. 
Projections indicate that there will be roughly 12,000 marijuana arrests citywide in 2018 — substantially lower than numbers recorded during the tenures of mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. In 2011, under Bloomberg, cops wracked up 51,051 pot arrests. In 2001, under Giuliani, cops made 41,588 arrests. 
That number is substantially lower than the eras of Giuliani and Bloomberg. In 2011, under Bloomberg, cops wracked up 51,051 pot arrests. In 2001, under Giuliani, cops made 41,588 arrests. 
Pot busts during the de Blasio era are still far more prevalent than they were during the tenures of mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins. In 1987, under Koch, there were 2,859 pot arrests and in 1991, under Dinkins, there were just 777 pot-related arrests. 
On Sept. 1, the NYPD will begin ticketing those caught smoking pot or possessing less than 25 grams. 
“The NYPD enforces the law fairly and equally, and works tirelessly every day to keep every resident and every neighborhood safe,” the department said in a statement. 
“The NYPD is also committed to building trust between police and the community,” the statement continued, “whether by dramatically reducing stop-and-frisk by more than 90%; by providing more than 8,000 officers with fair and impartial training; or by implementing a new neighborhood policing strategy that bring cops and community closer together through mutual respect and partnership.”"

New York companies should start considering whether they would change marijuana policy if recreational use is legalized in New York, one expert said.       Photo Credit: MStudioImages / iStock 
As New York appears to inch closer toward legalizing recreational use of marijuana, now is the time for employers to start thinking about possible changes to workplace policies, according to one expert. 
Michelle Lee Flores, a partner with the firm Akerman who specializes in marijuana law, said a common misconception after a state legalizes pot is that companies won’t test for the drug during the hiring process or as part of a workplace policy. The reality: Employers have a choice to make. 
“They can say, ‘we are not going to test it,’ or they can say, ‘we’re still going to test it and one of the things we’re going to hang our hat on is the fact even though under state law it may be legal, under federal law it is not,’ ” Flores, 50, said. “Even New York’s Compassionate Care Act has two exceptions that say it does not require an employer to do any act that would put the employer in violation of federal law or cause it to lose a federal contract or funding.” 
While New York does have a medical marijuana program (the Compassionate Care Act), recreational use remains illegal. But the drug’s legal status in the state could change as more politicians voice support for recreational use. Earlier in July, the state Department of Health issued a report recommending marijuana legalization, arguing that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
If state lawmakers do pass legislation to legalize the drug and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs it into law, Flores warned that employees should understand their employer can still enforce a “zero-drug-in-the-workplace policy” by focusing on how impairment by controlled substances at work can negatively affect the company. 
“Alcohol is legal to purchase if you’re a certain age, but we also understand that we don’t show up to work drunk or we could be fired,” Flores said. “That’s the paradigm.” 
Conversely, an employer might choose to no longer include marijuana on a post-offer, pre-employment drug test, which usually includes pot, opiates, amphetamines, PCP and cocaine. 
A good workplace policy, according to Flores, would lay out both state and federal law as it pertains to marijuana and then outline what the company would do if there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is impaired by an illegal substance.

“The key really for me, in guiding clients, is communication; really, truly communication,” Flores added. 
The policy also should clearly state whether the company intends to test for marijuana during the hiring process as well as acknowledge whether it will engage in an “interactive process” with regard to medicinal use of the drug. 
“In California, you would want to say, ‘don’t tell me what your condition is, but is there some alternative legal under the federal law that you could use instead of cannabis.’ And having that dialogue to at least make sure that you engage in that to determine if there is a reasonable accommodation,” that can be made, Flores explained. 
If New York does legalize recreational use of marijuana, there would likely be a time period between when the bill is signed into law and when the law goes into effect, which Flores said should be used by companies to clarify their stance on marijuana use to employees. 
“Because once it happens, there seems to be kind of this — I don’t know if it’s a sense of entitlement or what — there are some individuals that think, ‘well it’s legal now; you can’t do anything to me,’ “ she said. “And that’s actually not true.”

Legalizing and regulating marijuana in New York now has the backing of the state Department of Health. 
A report released by the health department on Friday states that the benefits of legalizing adult recreational use of the drug outweigh the potential negative effects. The report comes roughly six months after Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked DOH to conduct a thorough assessment of the impacts marijuana legalization could have on the state. 
The agency cited various health and tax revenue benefits, as well as a reduction in the disproportionate criminalization and incarceration rates in communities of color, in the assessment’s conclusion. 
Officials took a public health approach in their examination, according to state Department of Health Commissioner Howard A. Zucker, interviewing members of various state agencies related to health, public safety, criminal justice, education and economics. Also taken into account was the impact regulated recreational marijuana programs have had in other states. 
“This is particularly important because the status quo in NYS is changing as the state shares borders with some jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana and some that are likely to legalize soon,” the report says. 
The report also warned of some hurdles that need to be cleared if lawmakers decide to take legislative action, mainly with regard to implementing regulatory standards and testing. Currently, there is only one lab that handles testing for the state’s medical marijuana program. 
In order for recreational use of marijuana to become legal in New York, the legislature would have to pass legislation and Cuomo would need to sign it. 
Cuomo, who signed the state’s medical marijuana program into law in 2014, has held a relatively conservative view of legalizing recreational use of the drug. If he voices support for the report, it would signal a hefty policy shift. It also would put him on the same page as gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon, who has expressed support for legalizing marijuana if she’s elected.

The state and city budgets could get a high from legalizing marijuana, a new analysis argues. 
City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who supports legalization, released a report Tuesday estimating the annual market for marijuana could be as large as $3.1 billion statewide and $1.1 billion citywide and that it could generate as much as $1.3 billion annually in tax revenue. 
His office compiled the estimates by applying tax rates similar to those used by states where marijuana is legal to the number of New Yorkers believed to use marijuana, based on the usage rates reported on national surveys. Stringer found the sale surcharges could annually direct $436 million to the state, $336 million to the city and $536 million to other local governments within the state. 
Beyond the budgetary boost, Stringer argued legalizing adult use of marijuana would be an equitable move because arrests for smoking marijuana are disproportionately higher among young black and Latino New Yorkers. 
“ . . .... This is not just about dollars — it’s about justice,” Stringer said in a statement. “Legalizing marijuana and reclassifying past convictions are critical steps away from failed policies, and the time to take them is now. I support legalizing marijuana and doing what’s right — building up the very communities that criminalization tore down.” 
The state legalized marijuana for medical use in 2014. In his budget proposal, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed studying the economic impacts of legalizing marijuana versus keeping it illegal as other nearby state begin to permit its use. 
When asked about legalizing marijuana last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was “just not there” due to concerns about steps people may take to dodge related taxes and corporations seizing on the legalization to get younger people hooked on the drug. 
In his report, Stringer noted that usage rates among teens have declined in states that legalized marijuana. In Washington and Colorado, marijuana use among 12 to 17-year-olds declined after it was legalized, though the impacts varied among adults, according to the comptroller’s report.

Pioneers of New York’s medical marijuana program are expressing cautious excitement over the prospect of adult use legalization. 
“This industry is probably the fastest moving industry there is right now,” said Jeremy Unruh, director of public and regulatory affairs for PharmaCann LLC, which operates a dispensary in the Bronx. 
Unruh suggested the state’s medical marijuana program could serve as a steppingstone as lawmakers move closer toward legalizing recreational use of the drug, but he also warned of a much-needed expansion to the current system before the average New Yorker is allowed to legally light up. 
“I think that there are some intermediate steps that ought to be taken before adult use comes to fruition, but we’re very encouraged by the openness of policy makers to explore an expansion of the existing medical marijuana program and transition into adult use,” Unruh, 47, said by telephone on Tuesday. 
Several state bills have been put forth related to marijuana consumption in New York, including one sponsored by Sen. Liz Krueger that would legalize and tax marijuana for adults over the age of 21. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, has said he would order the NYPD to issue summonses instead of arresting people who are caught smoking marijuana, citing the likelihood of legalization in the future. 
The announcement comes amid a flurry of elected officials expressing support for legalizing recreational use, including Public Advocate Letitia James, who has launched a bid to become the state attorney general. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance also recently said that beginning in August, he would no longer prosecute marijuana possession and smoking charges unless the case posed a threat to public safety.

If the state does legalize adult use, NYU professor of public policy Mark Kleiman, 66, said he would like to see a model that is different from the way alcohol or cigarettes are sold, since those industries, he said, exploit consumers who continually buy their products. 
“It’s a very bad idea to set up a commercial industry in an abusable commodity,” he said. “I would like to see nonprofits in the business; I would like to see state stores, lots of co-ops.” 
There are several issues that need to be resolved, however, before adult use should be legalized, primarily with regard to patient access and statewide testing. 
Nicholas Vita, CEO of Columbia Care, which operates a dispensary in Manhattan and is planning to open another in Brooklyn this summer, warned of quality control issues if the state moves too quickly. 
“We believe that this is a net positive, particularly if New York does it the way it approached the medical program, which is a very methodical, disciplined rollout that focused on standards and quality,” Vita said of the prospect of marijuana legalization. 
Even if there is an increase in operators in New York, Vita believes the state’s focus on quality and control of the product will remain a priority. 
“You never want to have any products that are available to the general public that aren’t properly tested,” he added. 
Whether it’s the difficulty of finding a physician, affording a physician or having to drive more than two hours to the nearest dispensary, Unruh said a lack of patient access is inhibiting the current program and could prevent adult use legalization from being effective if the issues are not addressed. 
While there are about 20 million people living in the state of New York, there are just over 56,000 people enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program. Considering the list of debilitating conditions to qualify, including cancer and HIV, Unruh said the number of certified patients could and should be much higher. 
The current medical marijuana program allows 10 licensed companies to operate four dispensaries each, but a bill being considered in the state Senate would allow each of the organizations to open up to 25 dispensaries. 
Unruh said the bill would serve a number of goals: improving patient access while simultaneously scaling regulators into a better position for an adult use industry, among them. 
“If you’re going from 56,000 patients and 20 dispensaries up to whatever the market looks like in an adult use framework, which I have to think is hundreds and hundreds of thousands of consumers, that’s like going from zero to 1,000,” he said. “They need to figure out how to expand the existing medical program to ramp into that, just from a regulatory perspective.” 
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Diane Savino, would also address Vita’s concerns about quality and control by increasing the number of testing facilities in the state from one to three. 
Regardless of what adult use legalization comes to look like in the state, Vita said he’s not at all concerned about his company being pushed out of the market. 
“There is a huge medical need, and more importantly I think there’s a very substantial demand profile for high quality manufactured products that can be used for lifestyle purposes,” he said. 
Kleiman also argued there likely would still be a market for medical marijuana products, particularly for users with compromised immune systems that require a higher contamination standard. 
“Leave the producers in place and let the sellers have two windows,” he said. 
As New Yorkers watch the progress of decriminalizing marijuana unfold, Vita said he hopes that policy makers are using data rather than emotion to make legislative decisions. 
“Ultimately, what we don’t want to happen is for a program to be rolled out that isn’t well thought out and it doesn’t have all of the unintended consequences addressed beforehand,” he said.

The de Blasio administration’s new marijuana policy is being panned by community advocates and criminal justice experts who say it will do nothing to address the racial disparity in policing public smoking offenses. 
The policy shift, outlined by Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill on Tuesday, dictates that officers should issue summonses for public pot smoking rather than arresting an individual beginning Sept. 1. The de Blasio administration estimates this will lead to 10,000 fewer marijuana arrests per year. 
There are, however, several exceptions to the policy that could lead to an arrest, including if a person is on parole or probation; has a warrant out for arrest; doesn’t have identification on them; has a recent history of domestic violence on record; or if their smoking poses a public safety risk. The policy was also announced with a caveat that gives officers “discretion on how to exercise their enforcement powers.” 
Attorney Cristina Buccola, founder of CB Counsel and New York Cannabis Bar Association member, said while she believes the new policy is a step in the right direction, she has concerns on how it will be interpreted by officers. 
“It seems like there’s still going to be discretion on the part of the NYPD on when this can be escalated into an arrest,” Buccola, 41, said. “My biggest concern is that nothing changes. . .We’ve just said these people still don’t qualify for summonses because of X, Y and Z.” 
The new policing policy is the direct result of a 30-day Marijuana Working Group convened by the NYPD in an attempt to resolve inequity in the way marijuana offenses were being enforced, citing a Manhattan District Attorney’s Office report that showed people of color are arrested on low-level marijuana charges at significantly higher rates than white people. In the wake of the report, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said his office would stop prosecuting most marijuana possession and smoking cases beginning Aug. 1. 
Several community groups argue the mayor’s new policy will do little to change the status quo, particularly in light of the exceptions listed for an arrest instead of a summons.

“If the mayor wanted to create a plan to make racial disparities in marijuana enforcement worse, he’s accomplished it with this,” Communities United for Police Reform spokeswoman Monifa Bandele said. 
Moving from arrests to summonses does nothing to address disparities and instead hides them from view because demographic data on summonses is not publicly released the way arrest data is, according to Bandele. 
Nick Encalada-Malinowski, civil rights campaign director for VOCAL-NY, said while the policy may lead to fewer arrests overall, the exceptions listed ensure that the same communities that were previously over policed will continue to be unfairly targeted. 
“If you’re on parole and you’re arrested (for pot smoking), you immediately go to Rikers Island. . .You’re basically compounding collateral consequences on top of each other,” he said, adding that since people of color are arrested for marijuana offenses at a higher rate, the mayor’s plan directly conflicts with seeking to reduce racial disparity. 
In announcing the new policy, de Blasio said he believes it will strike a balance between safety and fairness — a middle ground the mayor says he has sought for years. 
The NYPD made 19,000 arrests for possession in 2017 — down 64 percent compared with 53,000 arrests in 2010, according to the mayor’s office. While 50,000 of the 2010 arrests were related to smoking in public, that specific offense made up less than 17,000 of the arrests in 2017. 
Queens District Attorney Richard Brown called the policy “wise.” 
“By choosing this sensible path, by which only the presence of limited aggravating factors will justify an arrest, the police department will continue to have the ability to control the activity without the majority of those committing the offenses being arrested and put through the system,” he said. 
Several New Yorkers in midtown Tuesday afternoon said they believed the new policy will be helpful. 
“I think it is going to take away imprisonment for a lot of people who don’t deserve to go to prison,” said Steven Alcivar, 28, of Bed-Stuy. “I think they can focus on other things they need to focus on.” 
David Chametzky, 49, who grew up in Brooklyn and lives on Long Island, said he believes people should be allowed to smoke freely but also expressed concern for public safety. 
“The problem is if they are on the roads. If they are walking on the street, I have no problem. Smoke away.” 
The loophole of allowing police to use discretion in whether a person should be arrested, however, appears to be a sticking point for critics. 
“My understanding of the new policy is explicit that police can arrest anyone as long as they can come up with some justification for it,” Encalada-Malinowski said. “They could come up to someone and say, ‘hey, put that out and move on.’ But they can also use this discretion to arrest someone who shouldn’t be arrested.” 
The language used by the mayor’s office is reminiscent of discretion issues found with the now-banned stop-and-frisk policy, Buccola said. 
“Historically, we find these exceptions that always defer to police to exercise their power, but how are we gauging that?” she asked. “When we default to discretion, there’s no bright-line test. 
“We had it in stop and frisk and we’re going to have it here unless we recognize what actually poses a public safety risk.” 
Training police officers to understand when public smoking poses a public safety risk and when it’s a case of implicit bias will be a key factor in how successful the rollout of the new policy is, according to Buccola.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday he will take steps to prepare for the “likely” legalization of recreational marijuana in the city. 
The mayor will order the NYPD, which is currently holding a 30-day working group that examines its marijuana policing methods, to stop arresting New Yorkers who smoke up in public and to instead issue them summonses. 
He also announced an interagency task force that will convene to investigate issues surrounding the potential legalization of pot, such as policing, “facility siting, public health, education, small business engagement, and economic fairness,” according to a City Hall spokesman. 
De Blasio previously has been cautious when it comes to marijuana legalization, citing concerns over “the corporatization” of the substance, but he said the city should be ready with a legal framework when decriminalization arrives. 
“With marijuana legalization likely to occur in our state in the near future, it is critical our city plans for the public safety, health, and financial consequences involved,” de Blasio said in a statement. 
The Daily News first reported the announcement on Sunday afternoon. 
During his weekly appearance on “The “Brian Lehrer Show” Friday, de Blasio discussed some of the issues he had when it came to enforcing laws once pot was legal. 
“The dynamics of how you decide to address that, which type of measure you use — whether it’s arrest, or summons or some other measure, and how you make sure that enforcement is fair and equal — is a discussion in every state,” he said.

A spokesman for the mayor said there is no current timetable for when the interagency task force will assemble. 
A spokesman for the NYPD said the department is exploring the notion of giving summonses rather than making arrests for public pot smoking, in the 30-day review. 
“The 30-day working group on marijuana enforcement is underway, and this issue is certainly part of that review,” said NYPD spokesman Phillip Walzak. “The working group is reviewing possession and public smoking of marijuana to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust, while also promoting public safety and addressing community concerns.” 
Responding to data showing a racial disparity in arrests, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill told the City Council last week that officers do not target minority marijuana users. 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for a study of decriminalization and said that it is inevitable given the policy changes in other states. 
Last week, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said starting in August his office will stop prosecuting most marijuana possession and smoking cases.

Relief is on the way for medical marijuana patients in Queens. 
Curaleaf New York is set to open a new dispensary in Forest Hills on July 10, broadening the availability of medical-grade cannabis in the borough for patients with cancer, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and other qualifying conditions. 
The new dispensary, located at 107-18 70th Rd., will be the sixth such operation to open in New York City and the second to launch in Queens, according to the New York State Medical Marijuana Program website. The first dispensary in the borough, run by Vireo New York, opened in nearby Elmhurst in 2016. 
“Medical marijuana has already helped tens of thousands of New Yorkers and we are excited to welcome patients to our Forest Hills dispensary to access the treatment they need or learn more about medical marijuana and the state’s program,” said Michelle Bodner, president of PalliaTech NY, which operates the dispensary under the Curaleaf New York brand. 
Centrally located between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street, the 3,000-square-foot dispensary will offer cannabis products in several forms, including tablets, oils, tinctures, capsules and under-the-tongue strips. It will be managed by a New York-licensed pharmacist and counselors will be on hand to help patients determine the best course of treatment based on their condition. 
Prospective patients are urged to call 833-470-5323 to set up an appointment ahead of the dispensary’s grand opening. 
In order to purchase products from a medical marijuana dispensary, the Department of Health requires patients with qualifying conditions to obtain certification from a physician who participates in the state’s program. Patients can then register online to receive a medical marijuana card, which needs to be presented at the dispensary. 
As of June 26, there were 60,680 certified medical marijuana patients in the state, though it was unclear how many live in Queens. A request for data specific to the borough was not immediately returned by the state health department.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is promising a ""really smart plan"" will be released next week to address the racial disparities in marijuana policing. 
A 30-day task force convened by Police Commissioner James O'Neill on May 15 to ""review NYPD marijuana enforcement"" has completed its work, the mayor said Friday on his weekly appearance on WNYC. 
""The NYPD will be announcing the results of that task force and the actions that will be taken. I think it's been a very productive process,"" the mayor told host Brian Lehrer. 
The group's conclusions, which the mayor would not preview, will be among a flurry of decisions reached this spring that affect New York City marijuana users. The mayor last month announced plans to order the NYPD to stop arresting people for public consumption and issue them summonses instead, while Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said his office will not prosecute marijuana possession cases, with limited exceptions, starting in August. 
De Blasio, who is personally not a proponent of recreational marijuana legalization, said the goal of the task force is ""straightforward."" 
""We are the safest big city in America; we want to be the fairest big city in America. Those two goals go together... they actually support each other,"" he said on WNYC. 
Data showing that people of color in predominantly minority neighborhoods are arrested on marijuana charges at much higher rates than those in largely white communities has sparked Vance's decision to suspend prosecutions and motivated O'Neill's work with the task force. 
The commissioner said when the task force was announced that the NYPD needs ""an honest assessment"" as to why ""differences in arrest rates"" exist. ""The NYPD will review our practices to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust at the root of neighborhood policing,"" O'Neill said.

The prosecution of low-level marijuana offenses in Brooklyn fell by over 91 percent in the first half of 2018, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced Friday. 
The steep drop in prosecution rates stems from an expansion of an existing pilot policy on misdemeanor pot offenses to include cases of smoking in public. Combined with a 60 percent decrease in marijuana arrests, the district attorney’s office has seen a declination rate of over 70 percent so far this year, according to Gonzalez. 
“Aggressive enforcement and prosecution of personal possession and use of marijuana does not keep us safer, and the glaring racial disparities in who is and is not arrested have contributed to a sense among many in our communities that the system is unfair,” Gonzalez said in an emailed statement Friday. “This in turn contributes to a lack of trust in law enforcement, which makes us all less safe.” 
The number of cases accepted for prosecution in Brooklyn went from 349 in January to 29 in June — a decrease of 91.6 percent, according to the district attorney’s office. Of the cases that were prosecuted in the first six months of the year, 84 percent were dismissed. 
Eight cases that were prosecuted resulted in a misdemeanor conviction and a majority of the remaining cases ended with pleas to noncriminal charges. The individuals involved in the eight cases that resulted in convictions had prior criminal records, the district attorney’s office said. 
The expanded pilot policy reduced the number of court proceedings for low-level marijuana crimes, which freed up resources and strengthened the public’s trust in the criminal justice system, the district attorney said. 
Citing the policy’s success, Gonzalez said his office would continue to decline prosecuting low-level marijuana cases unless a person poses a serious threat to public safety, such as driving with burning marijuana or smoking on public transportation. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill had announced in June that beginning Sept. 1, New Yorkers caught smoking marijuana in public would face criminal summonses instead of arrest. The policy change came out of a 30-day working group convened by O’Neill to address racial disparities in the way marijuana laws are enforced in the city.

Gonzalez said he believes the drop in prosecution rates in Brooklyn will go even lower once the NYPD’s new policy goes into effect.

The electronic latch released with a click and Corey Hewitt opened the door onto a searingly bright room filled wall to wall with rows of lush, green marijuana plants. 
“This is not Cheech and Chong’s garage,” said Hewitt, who is in charge of the growing, manufacturing and sale of medical marijuana to patients for Columbia Care New York. 
This is the bloom room, where plants spend a couple of months producing robust buds that will be harvested and crushed to extract oil that is turned into medicine. 
Scientists with degrees in fields such as biology, botany, biomedical engineering, forestry, chemistry and packaging science oversee each step. Until now, seeing how they do it has been like trying to peer through the brick of  Building 12 at Eastman Business Park that houses cultivation and manufacturing operations. 
D&C reporters Patti Singer and Sean Lahman answer questions about medical marijuana  from our Facebook audience.
    Patti Singer, Sean Lahman, Virginia Butler 
Columbia Care is among 10 companies — and one of the original five — licensed by New York state to make and sell medical marijuana. Each company is allowed one manufacturing facility and four dispensaries. The company is licensed in 12 jurisdictions around the nation. Because THC, the psychotropic compound that gives the feeling of euphoria, is illegal at the federal level, the product can't cross state lines. So the company has multiple manufacturing sites. 
The Columbia Care facility at Eastman Business Park makes all the products for its dispensary at Building 28 (Theater on the Ridge) and for its other dispensaries in Manhattan and Riverhead on Long Island, and the one it is opening in Brooklyn. Columbia Care had allowed media to see the dispensary when it opened, and I'd written numerous stories about the company. Over the past two years, I’d asked several times to see the manufacturing side. 
Columbia Care received permission from the state Department of health, which regulates every aspect of medical marijuana, to provide a tour exclusively to the Democrat and Chronicle. Hewitt said that based on the increased number of people certified to use medical marijuana in New York and also Columbia Care’s own growth, the time was right to show what goes on. 
A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 
The elevator door opened onto a hallway and a smell hit me. 
“It’s the plant material,” said Hewitt, who was my guide along with security chief James Sinclair. “It’s like smelling pine. It’s like being in a Christmas tree farm.” 
It didn’t smell that fresh in the relatively stagnant air of the industrial corridor. A little like old oregano, a little acrid like a skunk wandered by a while ago. 
He said you can’t get high from just being around the plants, so if I thought I was feeling their effect, it would be my imagination. 
Hewitt said some parts of the tour would be off the record, but he wanted me to see the whole process. Before we could see the plants, though, we had to don lab coats, put booties over our shoes and caps over our hair. 
“There are bugs and things outside that could be on our clothing and potentially risk the crops,” Hewitt said. “We’re very careful to make sure we minimize it as much as possible.” 
Nothing is grown from seed, which means plants are cloned from other plants. We started where that process begins — with the mother stock in what's called the mom room. 
Dozens of plants stood under LED lights. Cultivation manager Casey Berg said the moms last four to six months. No worries about menopause. To make the next generation, branches from the moms are cut and put in soil, something similar to what a home gardener might do. 
But Berg watches over hundreds if not thousands (Hewitt declined to give the number) of plants that are the basis for the whole operation. 
Once a cutting is put into soil, it’s put under a dome to control humidity until the plant takes root and is strong enough to be potted. The process can take four weeks. 
A plant spends another four weeks in the vegetation room until it’s moved to the bloom room. 
Every plant gets a barcode and other identifiers so it can be tracked even after it’s made into a product. “God forbid if we ever have a product recall, we’re able to go right back to the mom strain and identify where it came from,” Hewitt said.

Columbia Care grows hundreds of strains across the nation based on individual state regulations and the company’s research on the role of medical cannabis. In New York, Columbia Care primarily grows two strains. One strain has a high content of THC, which can be used to relieve pain. The other has a high content of CBD (cannabidiol), which can be used against inflammation. They are combined into vapes, tablets and tinctures in different ratios to treat different conditions. 
The strains are kept separate throughout the process, even in the bloom room where they stay eight to 10 weeks until harvest. 
Columbia Care has multiple bloom rooms. I wanted sunglasses when we walked into this one. 
Squinting until my eyes adjusted, I saw that most of the plants were of uniform height and deep green. Large fans throughout the room created a breeze to keep the leaves moving, and here the scent was cleaner and more outdoorsy. 
But it wasn’t like strolling through Highland Park, where I could walk up to a plant and feel whether its leaves were soft or tacky. 
Hewitt was clear: Don’t touch. Cannabis is a Schedule I drug according to federal law, and I was not certified to handle the plant. I kept my hands to myself, trying to avoid the leaves like they were poison ivy, but the rich green fronds brushed my lab coat as I walked the narrow aisles between the movable metal beds. 
The bloom room is like a massive greenhouse. Employees were pruning, but these cuttings would not be used for new plants. Instead, they would be destroyed under strict guidelines from the state health department. 
All the plants are female and there is no sexual reproduction, Berg said. They start to bud after two to three weeks. To get the plants to fully flower, Berg mimics the shorter days of fall by reducing the lighting. 
Berg reached for a bloom and pointed out the crystals that hold most of the cannabinoid, a compound that the oil and ultimately the medicine comes from. 
Harvesting the plants is like shucking corn, Hewitt said. Employees wear protective clothing, put on gloves and strip the buds and leaves into a bucket. The leaves have some cannabinoid and will be ground up with the bud. According to state Department of Health regulations, the stalks have to be rendered inert and then thrown out. 
The buds and whatever leaves come off are put on trays in a drying room. The lighting is subdued, and big racks holding the buds look like something you’d see in a bakery. Instead of the aroma of dough, I got whiffs of what pine tar might smell like. 
The scent was stronger in the room where the buds are ground into a fine powder. I wanted to grab a handful, feel if it was as fuzzy as it looked or see if it would sift through my fingers like sand on the beach. But it’s illegal and I'm a law-abiding citizen. Besides, cameras are everywhere and security guards are burly ex-football players.

The next step is to extract the oil from that powder. 
“Think about the perfume industry, rose petals, how you get perfume,"" Hewitt said. “Decaf coffee is similar.” 
James Kingsley, dressed in scrubs and looking like he’d be at home in a hospital, runs the extraction process, which uses carbon dioxide at very high pressure to squeeze out the oil. 
The THC and CBD strains still are separate. “It’s easier for us to make the final product,” Hewitt said. “Imagine if you wanted vanilla-chocolate ice cream and you threw it all together. It’s easier to make vanilla on one side, chocolate on the other.” 
There’s more to do before the oil can be made into a vape, tablet or tincture. 
Hewitt compared this step to cooking ground beef. Even if you drain the fat, you’ll get some sludge after it’s been in the fridge. In the case of cannabis oil, that congealed substance is called wax. Chemist Zulema Melchor runs a process that leaches and filters out the wax. The apparatus where this happens had a rusty brownish stain. She also tests for potency and how long it takes before the oil degrades. 
“At the end of the process, you’ll have pure oil,” Hewitt said, showing a freezer full of containers stockpiled for current and future needs. “Now we can start to build (products).”

Columbia Care started dispensing medical marijuana in January 2016. Hewitt said the company has less than 200 employees statewide, but he did not give the figure for the dispensary and the manufacturing sites in Rochester. 
Berg was among the first. 
The 29-year-old has a bachelor’s degree in plant science from Rutgers. I asked him if he had the job everyone wants. 
“So I hear.” 
If the 450 applicants for a packaging job are any indication, Columbia Care is a popular place to work. But the company is picky. 
“We’re not just taking people off the street and saying hey, come plant marijuana, it’s fun,” Hewitt said. “We’re very serious about who we bring in and making sure we get the best education levels.” 
Columbia Care has several graduates from the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology. Every prospective employee undergoes a background check that includes their social media history and running their fingerprints through law enforcement databases. 
Once hired, employees get extensive job, safety and security training. Despite working in what seems like lockdown, employees are free to talk about what they do. Hewitt said when someone asks what he does and he tells them, “I don’t hear, ‘Are you in the stoner building?’ ” Instead, he said he gets questions about whether medical marijuana would work for their mom with dementia.

Think of chefs combining ingredients into the perfect recipe that turns out exactly the same time and again. The chemists at Columbia Care do pretty much the same thing. 
Hewitt said that for products used to relieve pain, promote sleep and stimulate appetite, more THC is added. To treat seizures, neuropathy or post-traumatic stress disorder, more CBD is used. CBD also can counteract the euphoric effect of THC, according to information provided by Columbia Care. All products also are available in a 1:1 ratio. (A medical provider who certifies a person to receive the medication can recommend the ratio, or the Columbia Care pharmacists can make the decision after meeting with the individual.) 
Samples of each lot are tested by the state to make sure they conform to standards of purity and potency. 
To make tablets, for example, the chemist would determine the proper amount of THC and CBD for the ratio being created, add filler material to create a powder and put the mixture into a hopper that feeds into die cavities on a rotating table. As the table spins,  force is applied to each cavity to form the tablets. 
While much of the process is high-tech with lots of moving parts, some of it remains labor intensive. Tincture bottles are filled by squirting the liquid through a hand-held pipette. Package cartons are glued one at a time. Each product is made in the same sterile area, so the line has to be cleaned between batches. 
But that’s changing.

Twice in 2017, the state health department changed regulations — first adding chronic pain to the list of conditions that could be treated and then letting companies make topicals, dissolvable lozenges and nonsmokable ground-plant material. 
Hewitt said the company spent 2017 refining its processes and bulking up inventory of oil for all its products. Instead of batches of 2,000, it’s now making lots in the tens of thousands. I stood in the secure vault that would stymie Superman and saw the plastic totes full of products that are transported under strict chain of custody to the dispensaries. 
Hewitt declined to provide the number of Columbia Care clients but said growth has been in proportion to increased demand statewide. As of May 8, there were 54,256 people certified by 1,615 practitioners to use medical marijuana, according to the Department of Health website. Hewitt said the average age of Columbia Care customers is 54, and the gender mix is about 50-50. 
Columbia Care used to do everything in four rooms. To keep up with demand, the cultivation and processing operations are expanding into 48,000 of the 253,000 total square feet available in Building 12. 
The increased elbow room includes separate areas for different products, so multiple lines can be made at once. He also said that by the end of the year, filling tinctures will be fully automated. As of the past week, the process to fold and glue the boxes became automated. 
Hewitt said the company’s goal is to be able to act like any other pharmaceutical company if the federal government someday relaxes rules around marijuana. 
I asked Hewitt if Columbia Care were getting ready for New York to legalize recreational marijuana, as some of its neighbors are doing. 
“We’ll see what happens,” he said. “The goal today is medical. ... It’s about sick patients. It’s about the quality of our products and ... making sure they’re consistent and reliable.”

Andrew Cuomo is proposing a study to look at the pros and cons of legalizing recreational marijuana in New York. Cuomo's proposal was part of his state budget address on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018.

ALBANY - New York's health regulators are nearing completion of a much-anticipated study of recreational marijuana that could clear the way for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to support legalizing the drug. 
The state Department of Health has signaled it will soon submit its findings to Cuomo, who has softened his anti-marijuana stance over the years as legalization has drawn more public support. 
The expected release of the study — which is examining the impact recreational marijuana would have on New York — comes after the state Democratic Party threw its weight behind a bill to legalize the drug, passing a resolution at its convention Wednesday supporting the measure. 
Timeline: Andrew Cuomo's changing position on marijuana 
In a statement, Health Department spokeswoman Jill Montag said the agency has been ""working to assess the health, economic and criminal justice impact of a regulated marijuana program in New York state and to explore the impact on New York of marijuana legalization in surrounding states."" 
""The Department will submit its findings to the governor soon,"" Montag said. 
Cuomo — who has long opposed recreational marijuana — first launched the marijuana study in January, citing moves by neighboring states like Massachusetts and Vermont to legalize the drug. 
In April, the Health Department signaled the study would be a longer-term project, promising to ""collect the relevant information"" by the fall before preparing a report.

Cynthia Nixon wants to legalize marijuana in New York 
The timeline, however, has since been aggressively accelerated. 
On May 14, Cuomo surprised reporters when he said the report would be completed ""within days"" — not the fall, as the Health Department previously said. 
His comments came as he faced pressure from liberal-minded Democrats to back legalization, particularly from his primary challenger Cynthia Nixon, the Sex and the City star who is challenging him from the left. 
Nixon called for marijuana legalization on April 11.

Any effort to legalize marijuana, however, would need support from the state Legislature. 
The Democratic Party's resolution specifically backed the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, a bill that would legalize, tax and regulate the drug while vacating previous marijuana convictions that would no longer be a crime. 
Sen. Liz Krueger, D-Manhattan, who sponsors the bill, said she welcomed the party's support. 
The issue is one of racial justice, she said; People of color are convicted under the state's marijuana laws at a much higher rate than white people. 
""I actually think here in New York, the people are way ahead of the politicians in what they believe is the right answer for New York state,"" Krueger said of marijuana legalization. 
""It's been the politicians — and I guess I'm one of them — who have been behind the public opinion and the public knowledge base as to why this is the right thing for the state and the nation."" 
Her bill, however, would need support from the Senate's Republican leadership if it were to be put to a vote this legislative session, which wraps up June 20. 
There are currently 32 Democrats in the 63-seat Senate, enough for a bare majority. But one Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, sits with the GOP, giving Republicans control of the chamber. 
Scott Reif, spokesman for Senate Republicans, didn't tip the conference's hand, but said the GOP is rather focused on reducing taxes, aiding businesses and ""keeping families and communities safe."" 
""Let the governor and others focus on legalizing drugs,"" Reif said. ""Affordability, opportunity, security — those are our priorities for the remainder of the year.” 
Leaders in the Democrat-led Assembly, meanwhile, have said positive things about marijuana legalization in recent days. 
Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, told reporters at the Democratic convention that New Yorkers' views on marijuana have ""evolved."" 
But he said the debate shouldn't be just about whether to legalize the drug, but also about the ""affect the criminalization of marijuana has had on people"" in the past. 
""There’s a lot of issues that we have to address,"" he said. ""It’s not just whether we legalize it."" 
On Friday, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, Monroe County, said he has two concerns about marijuana legalization: the long-term impacts, particularly among those with addictive traits; and how to determine whether someone has been driving under the influence of the drug. 
But Morelle, who is running for Congress, said he believes legalization is a matter of when, not if. 
""I don't know if it's the next six months, the next year, but I think it's coming,"" he said on WXXI's Connections."

Any day, week or month now, the state Department of Health will tell New Yorkers why it’s recommending marijuana be legal for recreational use. 
In mid-June, Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said the pros of marijuana outweigh the cons and said his department would release its report on the subject “soon.” 
A Health Department spokeswoman this week referred to Zucker’s statement when she responded to a request to narrow down the time frame. 
If the Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo agree with the Health Department’s findings, New York would join states such as Colorado, Nevada, California and Massachusetts that have legalized marijuana for recreational use. 
Considering the strict controls on medical marijuana, it’s natural to think recreational use would be tightly regulated. Nicholas Vita is chief executive officer of Columbia Care, whose manufacturing facility at Eastman Business Park makes medicinal cannabis for all its New York dispensaries. Vita talked with the Democrat and Chronicle about how he thinks the state should handle legalization. 
Vita said New York needs to focus on the quality of the products and controlling access. He said the state needs to protect teens and others “that could end up being collateral damage in an unregulated, unsupervised environment. ... It requires balance between enforcement, social justice, public policy, public health — all of those things deserve a voice. The biggest failure, if you look at other markets, is enforcement hasn’t been given an adequate role in the process.”

“No, not yet. ... I hope we have a voice.” He said that despite criticisms of the medical program, the program has operated with an integrity crucial to its success. He said recreational cannabis manufacturers have to show the same diligence. 
“As long as you have responsible operators that are qualified, who are interested in supporting their communities and supporting the program — whatever the program may look like — I think you’ll end up a success. I think the risk is that once you begin to underregulate ...  you could end up with a free-for-all. That’s not good for anybody.”

“I wouldn’t describe it as a burden. I think there are additional responsibilities.” Vita said people often compare cannabis to alcohol, which is strictly regulated from manufacture to sale — including how old you can be to use it. It’s the same with tobacco. He acknowledged that both of those end up in the hands of teens. 
Vita said that because of how cannabis products are made, he couldn’t be specific how the product should be regulated, but it had to be inaccessible to children. He said that in some states, the move to recreational use has been rough and polls show that residents who support recreational use are not pleased with how it’s being implemented. 
“The question is, can we together come up with a smarter approach, a more effective approach to maintain the integrity of what it is we’re trying to do in a broad setting?”

Columbia Care has been expanding its manufacturing facility for medical products, and you'd think that recreational use could boost business overall. As of May, Columbia Care employed fewer than 200 people in New York. The number of workers in Rochester was not available. 
Vita was vague about the company's plans for recreational marijuana. 
He said some politicians don’t want the medical manufacturers involved.  “I think that would be a mistake and a shame.” He said the manufacturers in New York produce high-quality products — experience that can be valuable in the recreational market. “How or whether or not we participate is a function of time and regulation. ... Ultimately, we need to play to our strengths.”

Even though New York has expanded the diagnoses that qualify for medical marijuana, it still is a limited list. Because of that, Vita said many people use cannabis on their own and self-medicate. 
“There are people that simply can’t fall asleep at night or have an eating disorder or have anxiety,” he said. Because they don’t qualify for medical marijuana in New York, they could be considered recreational users. 
Vita called that a shame. “My suspicion and my hope is, as we begin thinking about the expansion of regulations and expansion of access, it’s done so in a way that embraces people who are using cannabis as a form of chronic relief, as a form of palliative relief, as a form of improvement of quality of life.” 
Legal recreational use also would give those individuals an option subject to quality control, unlike street products they may currently be buying. 
“There’s no reason why anybody in the world should have to buy something where there hasn’t been validation,” he said. “That is a shame and it’s inappropriate.”

Why would the government ever legalize another addictive drug?
In my 40 years of working in the field of addictions, I have reviewed — literally — hundreds of articles and studies on marijuana. 
I have never seen one study that even hints that marijuana is a protective factor for positive youth development. I have never seen one study that states that marijuana use supports healthy families. I have never seen one study that concludes that marijuana use builds strong communities. 
In fact, overwhelmingly, the findings are exactly the opposite for all three cases. 
Popular opinion today suggests that marijuana is a benign drug and does not warrant the concern or apprehension of the past generation. However, scores of scientific studies have demonstrated the harmful effects and serious adverse consequences of marijuana use to both youth, young adults, and adults. 
Research on the health and safety effects of marijuana strongly correlates with many mental, emotional, psychological, physical and spiritual problems. In addition, many crimes, accidents, job and school performance problems have been associated with the use of marijuana.
While not everyone that uses marijuana becomes drug dependent, the reality is that marijuana use, as with alcohol and other drugs, certainly can lead to profound, chronic and progressive chemical dependency. The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimates that from 9 to about 16 percent of users will become cannabis dependent.
Its use can be very serious, dangerous, and have a profound impact upon the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Americans and their families. Society disregards the inherent dangers, but before they know it at least 10-to-25 percent of users experience problems — many grave and even catastrophic consequences.
And now with marijuana products having THC as high as 90 percent (an increase in THC from the 1-to-3 percent ratio in the 1960s), it makes the drug even more dangerous and addictive. Thousands of marijuana-dependent individuals have testified that marijuana use had a significant negative impact on their lives, and many admitted that quitting marijuana is much more difficult than quitting alcohol or even cocaine.
Marijuana has destroyed the dreams and the quality of life for countless youth and families. It is not the benign, innocuous, natural “herb” substance that some people make it out to be. And one of the greatest dangers of marijuana is that it is underestimated as a powerful pharmacologic, mind-altering substance. In this regard, marijuana is not fully appreciated for what it really is — a drug of addiction that will have devastating effects on our families.

ALBANY — A much-anticipated study on recreational marijuana will recommend legalizing the drug in New York, the state's top health regulator said Monday. 
Howard Zucker, New York's health commissioner, told reporters in Brooklyn that the Department of Health's ongoing study on marijuana in New York is nearly finished and has concluded the state should move ahead with legalizing and regulating the drug. 
The study will soon be finalized and delivered to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who ordered the study in January after neighboring states Massachusetts and Vermont took action to allow marijuana for recreational purposes. 
""We looked at the pros, we looked at the cons,"" Zucker said. 
""And when we were done, we realized that the pros outweigh the cons and the report recommends that a regulated, legal marijuana program be available to adults in the state of New York.""

Zucker said the study, which was performed by the Department of Health, looked at a variety of issues surrounding marijuana legalization, including where it would be grown, how it would be distributed and how much it should be taxed. 
It also considered what the minimum age to possess and use marijuana should be. 
He did not release any of the specifics of the study or give a timetable for its release, other than to say it would be completed ""soon."" 
A poll released last month by Quinnipiac University showed a majority of New York voters support legalizing ""small amounts"" of marijuana for personal use. 
All told, 63 percent of those polled said they support it, including 71 percent of Democrats. Republicans were more wary: 56 percent were opposed. 
Cuomo, meanwhile, has been slower to embrace legal marijuana than many within his party, calling it a ""gateway drug"" as recently as last year. 
But Cuomo launched the marijuana study in January amid the movement by neighboring states, tasking the Department of Health and other state agencies with weighing the implications. 
Legalizing the drug will likely have to wait until 2019 at the earliest. 
The state Legislature is scheduled to end its 2018 session on Wednesday, and the Republicans who lead the narrowly divided state Senate haven't embraced legalization. All 213 state legislative seats are on the ballot this year. 
Advocates for marijuana legalization were pleased to hear Zucker's comments Monday, but said they will wait to see the full study before embracing his position. 
In particular, advocates are hoping the report addresses the criminal justice issues related to marijuana legalization, including what to do with prior convictions under the state's marijuana laws. 
""We're encouraged that they would like to move forward with legalization in the state but we're very interested in seeing the full details,"" said Melissa Moore, New York deputy director of the Drug Policy Alliance. 
Legal marijuana opponents accused Cuomo's administration of acting on politics, noting Cynthia Nixon — the Sex and the City star challenging Cuomo from the left in a Democratic primary — supports legalizing the drug. 
Cuomo's GOP opponent Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, knocked Zucker's announcement — as did other opponents. 
""I think Andrew Cuomo is a political creature and everything he does should be viewed through the lens of politics,"" said Jason McGuire, executive director of Spencerport-based conservative group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms."

ALBANY - Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration is almost finished with a study on recreational marijuana that many expect could clear the way for the Democrat to back legalizing the drug. 
Cuomo, however, has long been more cautious on marijuana than many within his party, reiterating his opposition to recreational marijuana as recently as last year, when he called it a gateway drug. 
More: New York keeps inching closer to marijuana legalization 
Here's a look at Cuomo's history with marijuana policy and how his positions have changed over the years. 
During his first, ill-fated run for governor, Cuomo says he ""tried marijuana in my youth."" He later reiterated this when he was asked about any past drug use during his second run for governor in 2010. 
A week before his election as governor, Cuomo comes out against medical marijuana. ""The dangers of medical marijuana outweigh the benefits,"" he said. 
Cuomo tells reporters he’s studying the issue of medical marijuana. “We’re talking to both sides of the issue, if you will, and we’re reviewing it, but we don’t have a final position,"" he said. 
“I understand the benefits, but there are also risks and I think the risks outweigh the benefits at this point,"" Cuomo said. 
Cuomo proposes reducing the penalty for public possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana. 
“If you possess marijuana privately, it’s a violation,"" he said. ""If you show it in public, it’s a crime. It’s incongruous.” Senate Republicans ultimately block the proposal. 
“We’re looking at it, but at this point I don’t support medical marijuana,"" he said. 
A Democratic senator proposes a bill to legalize recreational marijuana, but a Cuomo spokesman calls it a “non-starter.”` 
Cuomo reverses his medical marijuana position, pledging to launch a program that would make the drug available on a very limited basis at up to 20 hospitals. “I feel comfortable with this approach,"" he said.

Lawmakers approve a bill creating a broader medical-marijuana program in New York. On Cuomo’s insistence, it included a number of strict restrictions, including a ban on smokeable forms of the drug and limits on the number of dispensaries. He signs the bill. 
Cuomo reiterates opposition to legalizing recreational marijuana. 
“As of this date, I am unconvinced on recreational marijuana,"" he said. ""If you choose to use marijuana recreationally, you know the law.” Calls marijuana a “gateway drug.” 
Cuomo launches a study of whether it’s plausible to legalize marijuana for recreational use in New York, noting neighboring states Massachusetts and Vermont have done so. 
“It is a hotly debated topic, pardon the pun, and it would be nice to have some facts in the middle of the debate,"" he said. 
Department of Health spokeswoman says the agency will “collect the relevant information by the fall, at which point it will be reviewed and a report will be prepared.” 
Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo’s Democratic opponent, calls for legalizing recreational marijuana. 
Cuomo says the marijuana study will be completed “within days” — not the fall, as the Health Department had previously said. 
Delegates at the state Democratic Party's designating convention back the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. The resolution comes the same day Cuomo, who leads the state party, was nominated by party delegates for a third term. 
The state Department of Health issued its long-awaited report concluding the benefits outweigh the potential negative impacts of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The report is delivered to Cuomo, who says he will soon review it.

New York is inching closer to legalizing marijuana.(Photo: Thinkstock) 
ALBANY — New York could take in up to $678 million in tax revenue in a year if it legalizes marijuana for recreational use, according to a long-awaited report issued Friday by the state Department of Health. 
The state Health Department's 74-page report officially backed the legalization of marijuana, concluding that the ""positive effects"" outweigh the ""potential negative effects."" 
That conclusion was anti-climactic: Health Commissioner Howard Zucker had previously said the report would support legalization. 
But the full report, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered in January, analyzed an array of economic, social and criminal-justice issues associated with the drug, estimating the state could see anywhere from $248 million to $678 million added to its coffers in the first year depending on the price of the drug and the rate it's taxed. 
""The positive effects of a regulated marijuana market in NYS outweigh the potential negative impacts,"" the report reads. ""Areas that may be a cause for concern can be mitigated with regulation and proper use of public education that is tailored to address key populations."" 
More: Andrew Cuomo's changing position on marijuana: A timeline 
More: Legalizing marijuana in New York recommended by health commissioner 
More: Medical marijuana maker: Legalizing recreational use of marijuana in NY is a balancing act 
The report laid out dozens of reasons the state should legalize the drug, saying it could cut down on the disproportionate arrests of black and Hispanic users and allow the state to control the licensing and regulating of the industry. 
It used tax rates of 7 percent and 15 percent to come up with its revenue estimates. 
New York currently allows marijuana for medical use, though it's program is one of the most restrictive in the country, prohibiting users from taking the drug in smokeable forms. 
The report is the latest in a quick evolution for Cuomo, who has long been wary of marijuana legalization, calling it a ""gateway drug"" as recently as last year. 
But he has signaled he's more open to legalizing the use of recreational marijuana in recent months, ordering the Health Department to undergo the study as part of his State of the State address last January. 
Speaking to reporters Friday morning in Brooklyn, Cuomo said he had not yet read the report. 
“The report has come back,"" Cuomo said. ""I have not gone through it. I’m going to be briefed on it this afternoon by Dr. Zucker.” 
The state Legislature would have to approve any law legalizing marijuana for recreational use in New York. 
Lawmakers are not scheduled to return to the state Capitol until January. 
All 213 legislators are set to be up for election in November, which will decide whether Democrats or Republicans control the narrowly divided Senate — a balance of power that could have a significant impact on whether a marijuana-legalization bill gets a vote next year. 
The report was applauded by the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that has long called for marijuana legalization. 
In a statement, Chris Alexander, the group's policy coordinator, said any law legalizing the drug should include broad measures to clear the records of those who have been convicted under the state's current marijuana laws. 
“Now that the report has been released and its conclusions presented, we are hopeful that the governor and the Legislature can shift from the ‘if’ to examining the ‘how’ to legalize marijuana,"" Alexander said in a statement. 
After Cuomo launched the report in January, it was initially expected to be completed sometime before the end of the year. 
That changed two months ago, when Cuomo said the report was coming within days. 
Last month, Zucker said the report would conclude the pros of legalization outweighed the cons, saying the full document would be released ""soon."" 
The report was ultimately released Friday, a day after Alain Kaloyeros, the former SUNY Polytechnic Institute president who led some of Cuomo's top economic-development projects, was convicted of fraud in a bid-rigging case. 
Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo's Democratic primary opponent, issued a statement suggesting the report was meant to distract from the conviction. 
Cuomo said that wasn't the case. 
“Skepticism is one thing,"" the governor said. ""Paranoia is something else. This report was supposed to be done two weeks ago.""

What would legalized recreational marijuana mean to New Yorkers? 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that he wants a study to answer that question — and not just for the adults 21 and older who choose to use. Enacting the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act or a variation would change laws regulating many aspects of life in New York. 
Here are some questions that await the results of the governor’s commission: 
Mary Jane Kruger lived in Oregon, where recreational marijuana has been legal for personal possession since 2015 and commercially since 2016. 
The product could be bought only in licensed stores and could not be consumed in public. “I couldn’t walk down the street and smoke a joint,” said Kruger, who is back in Rochester and an organizer with Roc NORML, a new chapter of the marijuana advocacy organization. 
She said products were labeled and store staff advised customers as a sommelier guides someone buying wine. “They gave me some direction for me to make my own responsible decision as an adult. ... They’re not trying to get you as high as they can.”

Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The Colorado Department of Revenue reported marijuana taxes, licenses and fees for medical and recreational products generated total revenue of about $247.3 million for the calendar year 2017.  Retail sales began in February 2014, and the revenue from that year was about $67.5 million. 
From January 2014 through June 30, 2017, the Colorado retail marijuana sales tax rate was 10 percent. The state took 85 percent and local governments got 15 percent. Starting last July 1, the sales tax went up to 15 percent, with the state taking 90 percent of the total collected. 
For some sense of comparison, New York had about $275.4 million in state and local alcoholic beverage tax revenue in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute & Brookings Institution. 
Former Erie County Executive Joel Giambra, vying for the Republican nomination for governor, said legalizing marijuana and using the revenue is a more appropriate way than raising taxes to solve some fiscal problems like the state's crumbling infrastructure. Giambra made his comments Monday, the day before Cuomo's budget announcement. 
Carl Hatch-Feir, president and chief executive officer of Delphi Drug and Alcohol Council, said he’s heard arguments that marijuana is a revenue stream and also that it leads to accidents and other problems. Hatch-Feir said he didn’t have enough information to know whether legalization was an overall win or loss. He said the decision about legalization has to be based on scientific evidence from the federal Food and Drug Administration or a state agency using the same scientific process. 
Trooper Mark O’Donnell, spokesman for New York State Police Troop E, said law enforcement will wait for the law to be enacted before answering specific questions. But he compared marijuana to alcohol. 
“If you can legally possess it and you’re taking it and you’re driving, you can be arrested for driving with ability impaired by drugs,” he said. “Just like alcohol is legal to drink it, but you can’t drink and drive.” 
“The experience in other states, to my knowledge, has not been as big an impact as some have anticipated,” said Paul Keneally, a partner with Underberg & Kessler in Rochester and chairman of its labor and employment law practice group. “Hopefully, in many cases employees who are choosing to use recreational marijuana are doing it in a responsible fashion.” 
Keneally said that because of marijuana’s past, some employers may be reluctant to see it on a par with alcohol. “If an employee is using marijuana on a Saturday and reports to work Monday sober, that’s the same as if the employee was using alcohol on Saturday and reported to work sober.” 
He said the opposite also applies — it’s not acceptable for an employee to show up with signs of marijuana use or alcohol use. 
“The easy answer is probably not,” said Melinda Lull, who holds a doctorate in pharmacology and is an associate professor in the Wegmans School of Pharmacy at St. John Fisher College. “The only way that someone would get that contact high would be if somebody was directly blowing smoke in their face at high levels.” 
But there are issues of secondhand smoke. “Some of the compounds that are produced when tobacco burns are similar to those things that can be produced when marijuana burns. Things like carcinogens that are in tobacco smoke, some of those things can be in marijuana smoke, too.” 
Lull said scientists are finding that marijuana activates the reward centers in the brain and can be addictive. She said legalization doesn’t make marijuana a benign substance and the discussion about marijuana has to include the same regulatory issues as alcohol. 
That's how it works in some places, but it's not known whether New York would allow that. 
Columbia Care manufactures medical marijuana and has a dispensary at Eastman Business Park. Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Vita sent this statement: “Columbia Care is committed to offering patients in Rochester and across the Empire State a natural treatment option through our portfolio of medical marijuana derived products that are safe, consistent and manufactured to stringent quality standards set by the New York Department of Health. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering New Yorkers the first-class, expert medical products and services they deserve.” 
A spokesman for Fiorello Pharmaceuticals, which is scheduled to open a dispensary in the first quarter of this year, declined to comment. 
The federal government classifies the THC in marijuana the same as it does heroin, and it’s illegal to bring marijuana across state lines. 
Vermont’s Senate approved a recreational marijuana bill earlier this month, making it the first state to use the legislative process to legalize the drug. Other states have put it to a public vote. Vermont law would allow adults 21 and older up to 1 ounce of marijuana and two mature plants or four immature plants. The law does not include mechanisms for taxing and regulating production and sale, according to the Associated Press. 
In Massachusetts, adults 21 and older can have up to 1 ounce outside their residence and up to 10 ounces inside their residence. Adults would not be able to buy marijuana until a recreational dispensary opens, which could be as earlier as June. 
The province of Ontario in Canada could legalize recreational marijuana by July for adults 19 and older. 
Pennsylvania and Ohio allow medical marijuana. 
Washington, Oregon, California and Nevada are among states where consumers can buy recreational marijuana.

Troopers said they could smell a ""strong odor of marijuana,"" which led to a search of the vehicle. When they opened a large wooden crate in the bed of the rental pickup truck, state police found 204 pounds of individually-packaged high-grade marijuana, according to a news release. 
State police arrested the driver of that truck, 69-year-old Anthony Donofrio, of New Rochelle, and his passenger, Danny A. Aguayo, 35, of Stamford, Conn. 
Donofrio and Aguayo were charged with first-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.  
State police say they arrested the men and seized the marijuana after a traffic stop on state Route 208 in the town of Montgomery, about an hour and a half drive south of Albany.
Aguayo and Donofrio were arraigned on the drug charge and sent to the Orange County Jail on $50,000 bail or $100,000 bond.

""The positive effects of a regulated marijuana market in New York state outweigh the potential negative impacts,"" says the report which was submitted to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. 
New York legalized medical marijuana two years ago. 
New York is bordered by states -- Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey -- that have legalized recreational marijuana or are considering doing so. The state also shares a border with Canada which will legalize marijuana for pleasure in October. 
The report says if New York does not legalize the drug, residents may start crossing state lines to buy marijuana, which could lead to an increase in marijuana possession arrests in border counties and a big loss of potential tax revenue. 
The report estimates legalizing recreational pot could produce up to $340.6 million in tax revenue in the first year. 
But the report says legalizing marijuana could come with tradeoffs. 
""It is imperative that a regulated marijuana program contain all necessary safeguards and measures to limit access for individuals under 21, minimize impaired driving, provide education and tailored messaging to different populations and connect people to treatment if needed,"" the report says.

216,218,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2018/07/post_59.html,NY urges banks to start doing business with marijuana industry,"New York wants state-chartered banks and credit unions to start providing services to medical marijuana businesses which operate on a cash-only basis because banks are afraid to get involved in the pot industry. 
Medical marijuana businesses are forced to pay their employees and taxes with wads of cash, according to memo released today by the state Department of Financial Services. 
These cash-only businesses, their employees and customers are in danger of becoming targets of criminals, according to the memo. 
Banks are reluctant to do business with medical marijuana providers because marijuana is considered illegal by the federal government which regulates banks. 
The department said it will not take any regulatory action against state chartered banks or credit unions that provide services to marijuana businesses as long as they follow federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network guidelines issued in 2014. 
Early this year U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws. 
But the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network guidelines are still in effect. Those guidelines require banks to make sure medical marijuana businesses are licensed before establishing banking relationships with them. 
""We're cutting the red tape and removing regulatory barriers to support businesses in the legal cannabis industry,"" Lieutenant Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared statement. ""Today's action to encourage banking relationships will go a long way to assist this emerging sector of our economy."" 
Medical marijuana became available in New York in 2016. 
New York's push to get banks doing business with the pot industry comes at a time when the state is considering legalizing recreational marijuana.

217,219,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/index.ssf/2018/06/canada_senate_legalizes_marijuana.html,Senate legalizes marijuana in Canada but implementation delayed,"Canada's Senate gave final passage Tuesday to the federal government's bill to legalize cannabis, though Canadians will have to wait at least a couple of months to legally buy marijuana as their country becomes the second in the world to make pot legal nationwide. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government had hoped to make pot legal by July 1, but the government has said provincial and territorial governments will need eight to 12 weeks following Senate passage and royal assent to prepare for retail sales. Trudeau's government is expected to decide a date that would legalize it in early or mid-September. 
""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana -- and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,"" Trudeau tweeted. 
Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade. 
The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 52-29. 
""We have seen in the Senate tonight a historic vote that ends 90 years of prohibition of cannabis in this country, 90 years of needless criminalization, 90 years of a just-say-no approach to drugs that hasn't worked,"" said independent Sen. Tony Dean, who sponsored the bill in the upper house. 
Canada is the largest developed country to end a nationwide prohibition on marijuana use. In the neighboring U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States' biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan. 
Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould tweeted that it was a ""historic milestone for progressive policy in Canada as we shift our approach to cannabis"" 
Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor tweeted she was thrilled that the Senate approved the bill. ""We're on the cusp of a sensible, responsible and equitable cannabis policy,"" she said. 
The Canadian government largely followed the advice of a marijuana task force headed by former Liberal Health Minister Anne McLellan as well as the advice of former Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, who is the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister. 
The task force recommended adults be allowed to carry up to 30 grams of pot and grow up to four plants. It also said marijuana should not be sold in the same location as alcohol or tobacco. 
The most controversial aspect of Canada's move to legalize marijuana nationwide has been setting the minimum age for use at 18 or 19, depending on the province. That is lower than in U.S. states that have embraced legalization. 
Advocates argued that putting the limit at 21 would encourage a black market and drive youths into the hands of criminals. But some health experts have worried that the lower age will encourage use of a substance that can have long-term consequences on still-maturing brains. 
Conservative senators remained staunchly opposed to legalization. 
""We're going to have all those involved in illegal marijuana peddling right now becoming large corporation,"" Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos said. ""When you normalize the use of marijuana and you're a young person and you had certain reservations because of the simple fact that it was illegal, there's, I believe, a propensity to have somebody be more inclined to use it.""

218,220,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2018/07/state_health_department_says_legalizing_pot_could_cut_down_on_spike_abuse.html,NYS Health Dept. says legal pot could reduce 'spike' abuse; will it cost too much?,"Legalizing marijuana would likely reduce the number of people who choose to smoke synthetic marijuana, known by many here as ""spike,"" according to the New York State Department of Health. 
The reduction in ""spike"" abuse is among many reasons health department researchers said the benefits of legalizing marijuana in New York outweigh the costs, according to a study published last week. 
The study was published just as Syracuse was enduring an uptick in overdoses of synthetic marijuana. 
At least 50 people were sent to emergency rooms after consuming the drug, which often made users pass out or behave erratically. The overdoses tended to be concentrated downtown and near the Rescue Mission, but some were also in other areas of the county. 
The study's authors said a legal marijuana policy should aim not only to reduce the consumption of black-market marijuana but also be aimed at ""ultimately eliminating"" the synthetic marijuana market. 
""A regulated marijuana program should include among its goals reducing the use of synthetic cannabinoids... and ultimately eliminating the synthetic cannabinoid market,"" the authors wrote. 
The authors said some people take synthetic marijuana out of concern for failing urinalysis tests required by employers or probation offices. Synthetic drugs often do not show up on commonly used drug tests. 
""There is disagreement between some experts about the effect legalization will have on synthetic cannabinoid use. However, it is clear that it is often chosen to avoid detection in urine testing,"" the authors wrote. ""One survey found that most users prefer natural cannabis."" 
They also cited a study that showed countries with legal marijuana had lower usage rates of synthetic marijuana. And the authors said attracting people to actual marijuana instead of ""spike"" could be particularly helpful for those with severe mental illnesses. 
However, the proposed cost of legal marijuana cited in the study is many times higher than synthetic marijuana. The local price of ""spike"" is about $10 for five grams, according to court documents and interviews with ""spike"" users during the recent overdose uptick. 
Researchers estimated that, if legalized, marijuana would be sold here for between $294 and $374 an ounce, which does not include taxes of up to 15 percent and local sales taxes. 
All told, an ounce of high-grade legal marijuana could sell up to $447, accounting for a 15 percent sales tax and a 4 percent sales tax. However, legal marijuana producers might not pass the tax on to consumers as they compete with the black market. 
An ounce of marijuana sells on the streets for $270 to $340 in New York state, according to the study, which cited a crowd-sourced database of black-market prices. 
According to court documents and ""spike"" users, an ounce of ""spike"" would cost about $56. 
Users here can buy a rolling paper stuffed with ""spike"" for $1 or $2 and can buy a five-gram bag for $10. 
The study does not address how a legal marijuana policy could deal with the price difference. 
Johanne Morne, director of the AIDS Institute who was involved in the marijuana report, said the report's proposed marijuana prices are just estimates that could change if the policy is implemented. 
And she said having a regulated marijuana market could help public health officials deal with people who use ""spike"" in other ways, like allowing for better education for users and linking them with services for their other needs. 
""When we talk about the elimination of the black market, we want to protect users who may be using synthetic marijuana,"" she said. ""The opportunity that we have is to create a safer space for people ... from a harm-reduction perspective."" 
She also said a market that sets pot prices too high and prevents people from buying marijuana wouldn't help anyone, so officials will do what they can to keep costs low for both marijuana smokers and ""spike"" users. 
""We can't create a scenario where individuals are not able to access the product, so all of that has to be taken into account,"" she said in an interview with Syracuse.com | The Post-Standard. 
The full study estimates legalizing recreational pot could produce up to $340.6 million in tax revenue in the first year. But legalization has some drawbacks that policymakers should try to address through education, cracking down on impaired driving and making sure those under age 21 have limited access to the drug, authors said.

The state Health Department said it has filed emergency regulations that make any condition for which opioids are prescribed a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. 
While chronic pain is considered a qualifying condition for medical marijuana, severe pain is not. The change means people prescribed opioids for severe pain can now replace those drugs with medical marijuana. 
The regulation also allows people being treated for opioid addictions to use medical marijuana as a replacement. 
""Medical marijuana has been shown to be an effective treatment for pain that may also reduce the chance of opioid dependence,"" Dr. Howard Zucker, the state's health commissioner, said in a prepared statement. 
Opioid replacement joins 12 conditions that qualify people in New York for medical marijuana. Those conditions include: cancer, HIV or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain. 
There are more than 62,000 patients in New York certified to use medical marijuana and 1,735 providers registered to prescribe it.

220,222,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/index.ssf/2018/06/marijuana-based_drug_for_seizures_gets_approved_by_the_us.html,Marijuana-based drug for seizures gets approved by the U.S.,"U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood. But it's not quite medical marijuana.
The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant -- but not the one that gets users high. It's not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.
British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.
FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.
The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.
Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn't contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.
Physicians say it's important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.
""I'm really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,"" said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. ""In the artisanal products there's often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.""
Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.
Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.
""I preferred this to some of those other options because it's is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,"" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.
Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer ""drop"" seizures -- in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.
CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.
The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with ""uncertain dosages and formulations.""
""We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,"" Gottlieb said in a statement.
The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.
Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.
Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.
""I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,"" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation's largest CBD companies. ""I really don't think it's going to affect us much.""
Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.
A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.
For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.
The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.
The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.
Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.
Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.
Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.
GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances.

221,223,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2018/07/spike.html,At least 50 people in Syracuse have overdosed on synthetic pot,"AMR ambulance crews have responded to at least 50 overdoses in the city involving the drug ""spike"" since Saturday, according to an official with the ambulance company. 
Nick Corbishley, an AMR supervisor, said the overdoses have occurred downtown and on the Near West Side and South Side. 
Ambulance crews don't know where the people overdosing are getting the drug. 
""All we know is it's easy to get,"" he said. 
Spike, also often referred to as ""Spice"" or synthetic marijuana, is a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with chemicals with similarities to THC, the mind-altering ingredient found in marijuana. The chemical makeup of the drug varies from brand to brand. 
The drug is extremely dangerous and potentially deadly, according to the Upstate New York Poison Center. 
Some of the people overdosing are relaxed, while others are so aggressive they have to be physically restrained or given sedatives, Corbishley said. 
He said the rash of overdoses seems to be slowing down. As of 9 a.m. today AMR had responded to two overdoses. By 9 a.m. Wednesday it had already handled 10 cases. 
Crouse Hospital's emergency room has seen 19 spike overdoses since Tuesday, seven of them since 3 a.m. today, according to Bob Allen, a Crouse vice president. 
Upstate University Hospital's ER has been seeing five to 10 cases a day, said Kathleen Paice Froio, a hospital spokeswoman. 
The Onondaga County Health Department has not responded to requests for information about the overdose outbreak.

222,224,NY,www.syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2017/05/new_york_reveals_names_of_medical_marijuana_doctors.html,New York reveals names of medical marijuana doctors,"New York has published a partial list of doctors and other providers registered to prescribe medical marijuana, information the state had been keeping under wraps. 
The list includes 22 Central New York providers -- doctors, nurse practitioners and physican assistants, most of them in Onondaga County. 
The list only includes providers who have agreed to be publicly identified. The state health department said it is prohibited from identifying medical marijuana providers without their consent. 
Nearly 1,000 providers statewide are registered to certify patients for medical marijuana, but only 32 percent are included on the public list. 
Finding participating doctors has been a hassle for many patients, who've been forced to make cold calls to doctors' practices to find medical marijuana prescribers. The state said the new list will make it easier for eligible patients to access medical marijuana. 
Patients must be certified by a provider before they can buy medical marijuana from a dispensary. 
The state expanded the medical marijuana program in March by adding chronic pain to the list of medical conditions that qualify patients for medical marijuana. 
Since then an additional 3,356 patients have been approved for medical marijuana, bringing the state's total number of certified patients to 18,348. 
The other qualifying conditions include cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy and Huntington's disease. Patients also must have one or more of these complications: wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, seizures, or severe or persistent muscle spasms. 
Medical marijuana is only available in New York in oral capsules or liquid forms that can be vaporized and inhaled or taken orally. Smokable marijuana is not permitted. 
Health insurance does not cover medical marijuana.

223,225,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-cops-halt-marijuana-stings-after-almost-all-arrested-were-black/484876151/,Minneapolis cops halt low-level marijuana stings after racial disparity revealed,"Minneapolis police abruptly ended the practice of targeting small-scale marijuana sellers downtown after revelations that nearly every one arrested was black. 
In a series of rushed announcements Thursday, authorities said that police would no longer conduct sting operations targeting low-level marijuana sales, and charges against 47 people arrested in the first five months of 2018 would be dismissed. 
The extraordinary turnaround came after Hennepin County’s chief public defender contacted Mayor Jacob Frey to complain about what looked like blatant racial profiling. Frey then directed Chief Medaria Arradondo to stop the stings. 
“I believe strongly that marijuana should be a lowest-level enforcement priority and that it should be fully legalized at the state level,” Frey said in a statement Thursday. 
“The fact that racial disparities are so common nationwide in the enforcement of marijuana laws is one of the reasons I support full legalization.” 
Sign up for the daily Evening Update newsletter
Get caught up on the news at 4:30 p.m. each weekday. 
Thursday’s announcement by the chief signals a shift toward a more lenient approach pursued in other major U.S. cities. Drug-related arrests by Minneapolis police have already fallen nearly two thirds from 2007 to 2016, police records show. 
But in recent years, Minneapolis police have stepped up their presence on Hennepin Avenue in response to concerns about safety downtown. Using undercover officers posing as buyers, they arrested 47 people for selling marijuana on Hennepin between 5th and 6th streets. 
The Hennepin County Public Defender’s office determined that 46 of those arrested were black. All were charged as felonies. Some were put in diversion programs, some were convicted and at least one man went to prison. 
“Almost all of those cases involve a sale of 1-2 grams of marijuana for a total of $10-$20,” assistant county public defender Jess Braverman wrote in a May 31 court document. 
Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty said she called Frey last week about the racial disparities, and she said the mayor pledged to have them halted. 
“Approaching black men and women who are low income and homeless and then having the county attorney charge them with felony drug sales makes me very angry and disappointed,” Moriarty said in an interview Thursday. 
Arradondo announced Thursday in a 12:30 p.m. news conference that he had discontinued stings targeting low-level marijuana sales at the request of Frey. “While the intention was good, it had an unintended consequence,” he said. 
He said that during the downtown police effort, officers arrested other people who were in possession of illegal guns and other drugs such as opioids, although that was separate from the marijuana arrests. 
Arradondo defended his officers, saying they were acting professionally and not targeting black people because of their race. A police spokesman said that while the undercover stings were being stopped, police would still make arrests for marijuana sales. 
At 3 p.m., Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman issued a news release that said he had informed Arradondo that he would not charge any more people arrested in the stings and that he was reviewing the remaining cases. 
An hour later, his office notified Moriarty that all the cases were being dismissed. 
“These undercover drug stings by the Minneapolis Police Department occurred without our knowledge,” Freeman said in a statement. “Because they occurred over a period of months and were distributed to about a half-dozen of our attorneys for prosecution, we did not detect any pattern.” 
Though his office was alerted about the problem earlier, Freeman said he only learned about the situation Tuesday and “took immediate steps.” He said he told Arradondo he “would not be charging these types of cases” and began an immediate review of the remaining cases brought to his office’s attention. 
Besides getting the cases dismissed, Moriarty pressed Freeman’s office to free one person who had been imprisoned, whom she did not identify, and asked the county attorney’s office to join her office in a motion to expunge the arrests from her clients’ records. 
Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for Freeman, said the county attorney’s office was focused on dismissing the cases and had not considered the issue of expungement. He said that the case of the person imprisoned as a result of the sting is being reviewed. 
In a court document, Braverman wrote that the arrests “have resulted in felony convictions for numerous black defendants who had been targeted, and all the devastating collateral consequences that go along with such convictions: jail time, prison time, and even deportation proceedings.” 
Details about the stings were described in a case involving the arrest of one suspect, Shauntez Palmer, who was charged with fifth degree sale of 1.6 grams of marijuana. 
An undercover officer stated in her report that she purchased marijuana from another person, Ameir Davis on Hennepin Avenue between N. 5th Street and N. 6th Street, while Palmer acted as a lookout. 
Both men were arrested and brought to jail. 
The department’s First Precinct in conjunction with other precincts and the Metro Transit police sent undercover officers to that block on Jan. 24, Feb. 13, Feb. 28, March 15, April 11 and May 24, resulting in 47 arrests. 
“On the dates of the stings, officers are approaching people of color, individuals and groups, and asking to buy drugs,” Braverman wrote. “Officers have directly asked black men to facilitate drug deals with other black men, and have then requested that the facilitator be charged with sale. They are submitting the cases for felony charges.” 
Moriarty said that the only white person arrested was not approached by police, but had himself approached an undercover officer about selling some marijuana. 
In a letter to Arradondo on May 29, Moriarty wrote, “A review of the cases received by our office strongly suggests a trend of racial profiling under the guise of a ‘livability’ detail.” 
Mel Reeves, a human rights activist who lives in Minneapolis, said he was cheered by the decision to halt the stings. “It’s not news that black people are targeted by law enforcement on marijuana charges,” he said. “It’s good news they are recognizing the disparities and doing something about it.” 
As a council member, Frey championed an ordinance that brought city penalties for small-scale marijuana possession in line with state law, reducing the crime from a misdemeanor to petty misdemeanor. 
Frey said in his statement that while he supports the legalization of marijuana, it “does not negate the need for our officers to make the necessary arrests to get guns off our streets and end the sale of life-threatening narcotic drugs like heroin.”

224,226,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/easy-entry-into-oregon-s-legal-pot-market-means-huge-surplus/484134761/,"Glut of marijuana in Oregon is cautionary tale, experts say","When Oregon lawmakers created the state's legal marijuana program, they had one goal in mind above all else: to convince illicit pot growers to leave the black market. 
That meant low barriers for entering the industry that also targeted long-standing medical marijuana growers, whose product is not taxed. As a result, weed production boomed — with a bitter consequence. 
Now, marijuana prices here are in freefall, and the craft cannabis farmers who put Oregon on the map decades before broad legalization say they are in peril of losing their now-legal businesses as the market adjusts. 
Oregon regulators on Wednesday announced they will stop processing new applications for marijuana licenses in two weeks to address a severe backlog and ask state lawmakers to take up the issue next year. 
Experts say the dizzying evolution of Oregon's marijuana industry may well be a cautionary tale for California, where a similar regulatory structure could mean an oversupply on a much larger scale. 
""For the way the program is set up, the state (California) just wants to get as many people in as possible, and they make no bones about it,"" said Hilary Bricken, a Los Angeles-based attorney specializing in marijuana business law. ""Most of these companies will fail as a result of oversaturation."" 
Oregon has nearly 1 million pounds (453,600 kilograms) of marijuana flower — commonly called bud — in its inventory, a staggering amount for a state with about 4 million people. Producers told The Associated Press wholesale prices fell more than 50 percent in the past year; a study by the state's Office of Economic Analysis found the retail cost of a gram of marijuana fell from $14 in 2015 to $7 in 2017. 
The oversupply can be traced largely to state lawmakers' and regulators' earliest decisions to shape the industry. 
They were acutely aware of Oregon's entrenched history of providing top-drawer pot to the black market nationwide, as well as a concentration of small farmers who had years of cultivation experience in the legal, but largely unregulated, medical pot program. 
Getting those growers into the system was critical if a legitimate industry was to flourish, said Sen. Ginny Burdick, a Portland Democrat who co-chaired a committee created to implement the voter-approved legalization measure. 
Lawmakers decided not to cap licenses; to allow businesses to apply for multiple licenses; and to implement relatively inexpensive licensing fees. 
Oregon's Liquor Control Commission announced Wednesday it will put aside applications for new licenses received after June 15 until a backlog of pending applications is cleared. The decision comes after U.S. Attorney Billy Williams challenged state officials to address the oversupply. 
""In my view, and frankly in the view of those in the industry that I've heard from, it's a failing of the state for not stepping back and taking a look at where this industry is at following legalization,"" Williams told the AP in a phone interview. 
But those in the industry supported the initial decisions that led to the oversupply, Burdick said. 
""We really tried to focus on policies that would rein in the medical industry and snuff out the black market as much as possible,"" Burdick said. 
Lawmakers also quickly backtracked on a rule requiring marijuana businesses have a majority ownership by someone with Oregon residency after entrepreneurs complained it was hard to secure startup money. That change opened the door to deep-pocketed, out-of-state companies that could begin consolidating the industry. 
The state has granted 1,001 producer licenses and had another 950 in process as of last week. State officials worry if they cut off licensing or turn away those already in the application process, they'll get sued or encourage illegal trade. 
Some of the same parameters are taking shape in California, equally known for black-market pot from its Emerald Triangle. 
Rules now in effect there cap only certain, medium-sized growing licenses. In some cases, companies acquired dozens of growing licenses, which can be operated on the same or adjoining parcels. The California Growers Association, an advocacy group, is suing to block those rules, fearing they will open the way for vast farms that will drive out smaller cultivators. 
Beau Whitney, senior economist at national cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data, said he's seeing California prices fall. 
In contrast, Washington knew oversupply could draw federal attention and was more conservative about licensing. As the market matured, its regulators eased growing limits, but the state never experienced an oversupply crisis. 
Colorado has no license caps, but strict rules designed to limit oversupply allow it to curtail a growers' farm size based on past crop yields, existing inventory, sales deals and other factors. 
In Oregon, cannabis retail chains are emerging to take advantage of the shake-up. 
A company called Nectar has 13 stores around the state — with three more on tap — and says on its website it is buying up for-sale dispensaries too. Canada-based Golden Leaf Holdings bought the successful Oregon startup Chalice and has six stores around Portland, with another slated to open. 
William Simpson, Chalice's founder and Golden Leaf Holdings CEO, is expanding into Northern California, Nevada and Canada. Simpson welcomes criticism that his business is to cannabis what Starbucks is to mass-market coffee. 
""If you take Chalice like Starbucks, it's a known quantity, it's a brand that people know and trust,"" he said. 
Amy Margolis, the Oregon Cannabis Association's executive director, says capping licenses would only spur more consolidation in the long term. The state is working on a study that should provide data and insight into what lies ahead. 
""I don't think that everything in this state is motivated by struggle and failure,"" she said. ""I'm very interested to see ... how this market settles itself and (in) being able to do that from a little less of a reactionary place."" 
For now, Oregon's smaller marijuana businesses are trying to stay afloat. 
A newly formed group will launch an ad campaign this fall to tell Oregonians why they should pay more for mom-and-pop cannabis. Oregon Craft Cannabis Alliance founder Adam Smith believes 70 percent of Oregon's small growers and retailers will go out of business if consumers don't respond. 
""We could turn around in three to four years and realize that 10 to 12 major companies own a majority of the Oregon industry and that none of it is really based here anymore,"" he said. ""The Oregon brand is really all about authenticity. It's about people with their hands in the dirt, making something they love as well as they can. How do we save that?""

225,227,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/medical-milestone-us-oks-marijuana-based-drug-for-seizures/486470101/,Correction: Marijuana Medicine story,"In a story June 25 about a drug derived from marijuana, The Associated Press misspelled the first name of the director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. She is Dr. Elaine Wirrell, not Ellaine. A corrected version of the story is below: 
Medical milestone: US OKs marijuana-based drug for seizures 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a strawberry-flavored syrup to treat severe seizures that begin in childhood 
AP Health Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use. 
The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy in patients 2 years and older. But it's not quite medical marijuana. 
The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant — but not the one that gets users high. It's not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy. 
British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis. 
FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs. FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said his agency had supported research on cannabis-derived products ""for many years."" 
""This approval serves as a reminder that sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies,"" Gottlieb told reporters. 
The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV. 
Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. It doesn't contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect. 
Physicians say it's important to have a consistent, government-regulated version. 
""I'm really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,"" said Dr. Elaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. ""In the artisanal products there's often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it."" 
Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems. 
Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University. 
""I preferred this to some of those other options because it's a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,"" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York. 
Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer ""drop"" seizures — in which her entire body goes limp and collapses. 
CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses. 
The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear. 
FDA's Gottlieb warned about the use of CBD products with ""unproven medical claims."" 
""The promotion and use of these unapproved products may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,"" Gottlieb said. 
The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions. 
Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being. 
Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval. 
""I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,"" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group that supports access to CBD. ""I really don't think it's going to affect us much."" 
Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance. 
A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion. 
For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed. 
The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few effective treatments. Patients experience frequent, severe seizures, in some cases more than 100 per day. 
But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses. 
The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana. 
Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD. 
Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health. 
Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval. That decision is expected within 90 days. 
GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances. European approval is expected in early 2019.

226,228,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/on-net-minneapolis-policy-change-on-marijuana-enforcement-harms-public-safety/485183371/,"On net, Minneapolis policy change on marijuana enforcement harms public safety","The Minneapolis Police Department is in a no-win situation with respect to enforcement of marijuana laws, and Mayor Jacob Frey’s decision to ask the department to stop enforcing laws against marijuana sales will have a deleterious effect on public safety in the city. 
Criminalization of marijuana has not worked. Marijuana use is widespread: a Yahoo News/Marist college poll conducted in 2017 concluded that more than half of American adults have used marijuana and that 55 million Americans use marijuana at least once a year. A number of polls show that marijuana legalization is supported by more than half of Americans. It is also clear that the criminalization of marijuana has led to disproportionate levels of arrests of people of color. These arrests further strain the relationship between the police and the community they serve. 
At first blush, Frey’s decision to ask the Police Department to stop enforcing low-level marijuana sales seems like a good one: Indeed, it will likely reduce negative interactions between the police and a community that often feels overpoliced; it will save the cost of processing prosecution and arrests of some people whose arrest and prosecution serves little purpose in increasing public safety overall; and it will potentially free police resources to address more serious crime. While all of those things are good, the net effect on public safety may actually be a negative one. 
Marijuana is a popular product. The de facto decriminalization of marijuana — decreasing the likelihood of being arrested for its use or for the sale of small amounts of marijuana — makes it more popular. Because there is not currently a legal manner to bring this popular product to market, we have created a situation in which a highly lucrative commodity is often produced and always distributed by organizations that are, by necessity, criminal in nature. We have a long, sad history of violence in this country generated by criminal groups fighting for control of black markets. Decriminalization is likely to increase that violence by increasing the market demand and profit while still not providing a means for legal production and distribution. 
It is perhaps too early to tell if legalization of marijuana, where the sale can be regulated and taxed appropriately, will reduce violent crime, but the earliest research seems to suggest it will. One study shows a decrease in violent crime in Mexican border states that have legalized recreational marijuana. Legalization of marijuana will not necessarily eliminate the black-market production, distribution and sale of the commodity, but evidence suggests that it will greatly reduce it — and it certainly creates a more compelling government interest in the enforcement against black-market sales and distribution. 
There are, of course, other considerations to be weighed before legalizing marijuana. There is legitimate concern about whether legalization will have a negative effect on traffic safety by introducing more impaired drivers on the road. Early research indicates that (a) either more research is needed, or (b) there is not a significant difference between the amount of marijuana-impaired driving in states where marijuana is legal and those in which it is not. There is also legitimate concern about whether legalization of marijuana will increase use of marijuana among adolescents; like access to alcohol, cigarettes and prescription medication, education and prevention campaigns would be needed to address youth access to marijuana. What is clear, though, from numerous public health studies is that adult use of marijuana is not more harmful than cigarettes, alcohol or opiates, and is almost certainly less addictive than any of those legal substances. 
If we are truly interested in public safety by reducing violent crime, decriminalization may be the worst policy alternative: It increases the market for marijuana by reducing the disincentives to use it without providing a legal means for production and distribution. The risk of violence among black-marketeers certainly remains and may increase. Legalization through controlled distribution is a far safer policy alternative.

227,229,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/canada-to-announce-marijuana-legalization-date-soon/486030901/,Trudeau: Canada to legalize marijuana on Oct. 17,"Marijuana will be legal nationwide in Canada starting Oct. 17 in a move that should take market share away from organized crime and protect the country's youth, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. 
The Senate gave final passage to the bill to legalize cannabis on Tuesday, legislation that will make Canada only the second country in the world to make pot legal across the country. 
Trudeau said provincial and territorial governments need the time to prepare for retail sales. 
""It is our hope as of October 17 there will be a smooth operation of retail cannabis outlets operated by the provinces with an online mail delivery system operated by the provinces that will ensure that this happens in an orderly fashion,"" Trudeau said. 
The prime minister said at a news conference that the goal is to take a significant part of the market share away from organized crime. 
""Over the following months and indeed years we will completely replace or almost completely replace the organized crime market on that,"" he said. 
Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade. 
""The legislation is transformative,"" said Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, adding it ""marks a wholesale shift in how our country approaches cannabis, leaving behind a failed model of prohibition."" 
She urged Canadians to follow the existing law until the Cannabis Act comes into force. 
""The law still remains the law,"" Wilson-Raybould said. 
Many questions remain unanswered, including how police will test motorists suspected of driving under the influence, what to do about those with prior marijuana convictions and just how the rules governing home cultivation will work. 
The Canadian provinces of Quebec and Manitoba have already decided to ban home-grown pot, even though the federal bill specifies that individuals can grow up to four plants per dwelling. 
""Provinces can set their own laws. If individuals are challenging that law, they can challenge it,"" Wilson-Raybould said. 
Trudeau said the government won't discuss pardons of past convictions until legalization is in effect. 
""There's no point looking at pardons while the old law is in the books,"" Trudeau said. 
Trudeau said they are going to treat it like wine and tobacco, noting that few people will cultivate it at home, but it's necessary to fight organized crime. 
Trudeau promised to legalize it during the 2015 election and had set a goal of July 1 for it. The provinces pleaded for more time. 
Canadian marijuana stocks have rallied in anticipation of legalization and jumped again on Wednesday. 
In the neighboring U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States' biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan. 1. 
The news was greeted with enthusiasm by marijuana advocates in the U.S. 
Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the National Cannabis Industry Alliance in the U.S., said Canada's legalization should also serve as a wake-up call south of the border. 
""The most important takeaway is that it's time for advocates in the industry to double down, so as to not be surpassed by the Canadian cannabis industry,"" he said. 
Don Hartleben, who manages Dank of America, a retail cannabis store just south of the border in Blaine, Washington, said Canada's legalization was not only politically exciting, but a potential business boon for him. 
Many of his customers are Canadian tourists who are terrified of trying to bring pot across the border, he said. If more use marijuana when they're in Canada, more will use when they're on vacation in the states. 
""People ask me all the time, 'Isn't legalization in Canada going to hurt your business?'"" he said. ""I tell them, 'No! The more it's legal, the more people are going to feel safe to buy my product.'""

Both can linger long after a return to the homefront, affecting a veteran’s ability to successfully readjust to life stateside. 
With the deadly risks of frequently used pain relievers called opioids now exposed, it’s understandable that many veterans are turning to an alternative — medical marijuana. Despite legality that varies by state, an October 2017 survey by the American Legion found that nearly one in five veterans were “currently using cannabis to treat a medical condition” in lieu of opioids and were reporting better outcomes. It’s surprising the number isn’t higher given how many aging veterans or those returning from combat suffer from chronic pain — 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, compared with 30 percent of Americans. 
These data from one of the nation’s best-known veterans service organizations offer a compelling look at how an old and sometimes demonized drug could ease the suffering of those who have served. But far more rigorous study — meaning research that involves doctor-led trials and rigorously measured outcomes — is necessary before marijuana fully earns its spot in the medication tool box that providers can tap to help wounded warriors. 
That’s why Congress needs to act without delay in passing a new bipartisan bill championed by Reps. Phil Roe, a Tennessee Republican, and Tim Walz, a Minnesota Democrat who is running for governor. The duo’s “VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act,” announced this week, would clarify the authority that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has to research marijuana’s role in treating veterans. “When a veteran tells me they’re finding relief, I believe them,” Walz said in an interview this week. 
The bill has the support of the American Legion. And having two influential authors should help speed it through Congress. Roe, a physician, chairs the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Walz, a veteran, is the committee’s highest-ranking Democrat. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is expected to champion it in the upper chamber. Tester is the ranking member of the Senate’s Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Still, it’s unfortunate that these lawmakers need to draw upon their connections and goodwill to shepherd this through. VA leadership should have embraced the opportunity to research marijuana’s potential benefits long ago instead of finding excuses not to do so. 
One of these irresponsible foot-dragging episodes came to light late last year in an exchange of letters between Walz and former VA Secretary David Shulkin. Noting growing concerns about opioid risks, Walz and nine other House members called on the agency to wield its world-class research arm to study marijuana’s potential to treat veterans. Shulkin’s terse and tardy reply in December said federal law restricts the agency’s ability to do this — a conclusion a Brookings Institution expert called an “unfortunate combination of false information, incomplete analysis, and incomprehensible logic.” 
Shulkin was fired in March after a travel expense scandal. It is unclear if President Donald Trump’s pick to replace him, Dr. Ronny Jackson, supports VA research on marijuana. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose outdated views on marijuana likely influenced Shulkin’s poor decision, will probably still hold considerable sway over the agency’s future research direction. Having the Roe-Walz legislation passed or in the pipeline counters Session’s antiquated notions. It also sends two strong messages to VA researchers — get going, and Congress has your back. All treatment avenues must be pursued to deliver the care veterans deserve.

229,231,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-marijuana-moment-why-to-legalize-by-someone-who-doesn-t-inhale/474346773/,"Minnesota's marijuana moment: Why to legalize, by someone who doesn't inhale","I don’t smoke marijuana. There are secret purchases required, plus the learning of code, dealer etiquette, dosing expertise, exotic strains, the latest artisanal delivery systems, and it all sounds way too complicated. 
Also, because it’s easy to forget this detail, pot is illegal. 
But even if pot were decriminalized tomorrow — a proposal on the table at the State Capitol — the chances of my racing out to score some “Chronicles of Narnia” and then heading home to roll up a fatty are, well, slim. Unlike Bill Clinton, the one time I did blaze up, over 20 years ago, I inhaled quite deeply enough to find the effect unpleasant. Some of us have all the feelings of alienation and existential weirdness you could ask for, thank you very much. 
None of this is meant as a claim on virtue. My vice when the shop whistle blows comes by way of the less-healthy, socially acceptable pathway: that wrecker of livers, faces and families, the noble fermented beverage. 
Point being, I don’t write any of the following out of the reason we tend to suspect a person calls for legalization — you know, because the writer is into weed. 
It’s just that weed is already here, as if that really needed to be said, and has survived the ultimate multigenerational field test. Pot is ubiquitous in middle-class American life, or at least it was in mine. When I was growing up, my parents told us to stay away from drugs and people who take them, but the advice became tricky with pot. I smelled marijuana early and often, at parties, in the parks and at concerts back in the 1970s, mainstream shows filled with hypocrites now drawing salaries in the Twin Cities corporate economy. 
Why anyone would be upset about a fellow Minnesotan lighting up is beyond me. As one of the everyday smells of life in the Midwest, I’ll take the scent of some guy’s one-hitter in Section 102 over that of lutefisk, manure-spreading or the Pine Bend refinery any day. My first record store, now that I think of it, was a clean, well-lit head shop. It sat a block from a Catholic church in the heart of south Minneapolis and offered up roach clips, rolling papers and long, welcoming cases of bongs, so-called paraphernalia that we blithely sauntered past on our way to the stacks of “Hotel California.” 
Half of all Americans have tried pot, and more than 60 percent of Americans are in favor of making it legal for recreational use, according to the Pew Research Center. Eight states have done so — Colorado, California, Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Nevada — mainly independent-thinking places that share more in common with Minnesota than most states. 
Though the Trump Justice Department recently rescinded an Obama-era policy that brought federal prosecutors in line with state laws concerning marijuana, the reversal is likely to have limited impact, given the way that it pits busy prosecutors against the will of statehouses. Recreational use also seems to have pushed the many unknowable assertions about the benefits of THC for medical use to the side — you don’t need clinical trials if you can buy it over the counter — and it comes at a time in which popular culture has mostly abandoned its dated anxieties about pot. 
No one really finds the act of getting high all that interesting, for one thing. (Are you listening, Seth Rogen and James Franco?) The Cheech & Chong sketches and stoner jokes of eras past have quietly given way to depictions of “the banal normalcy of marijuana in American life today,” as the Washington Post recently described the rise of closely observed cable dramas dealing with pot, shows like “Weeds” on Showtime and “High Maintenance” on HBO. This seems to align with the life trajectory of pot use on view all around us, which is that there is no singular life trajectory of pot use, or at least no singular narrative that ends in addiction and ruin. 
In college, I had a hallmate who was selling. I looked him up the other day to see what fresh hell his life had become, but it turns out he’s a family man who holds a midlevel post at one of the Fortune 500 firms in town. The guy who got me stoned back in the ’90s is now a doctor for one of the big health centers in Minneapolis. 
These are only anecdotes, of course, and selling weed at a small liberal arts college is a far cry from selling in the neighborhoods, which has lately become a hazard. As the Star Tribune reported last week, dealing marijuana on the black market has become deadly in Minnesota, with 29 dealers having been killed over the last 11 years. Is that an argument against legalization or for it? 
Because smoking marijuana appears to be relatively safe. According to the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Science, just 9 percent of adults who try marijuana become dependent, compared with 15 percent of those who try alcohol and 32 percent of those who try tobacco. So while pot may show up in lives that go off track, there have always been enough exceptions that it’s hard to say pot was causal. The decades of telling ourselves smoking pot destroys lives only delays our reckoning with the forces that do destroy lives. Pot is just a part of who we are, a culturally sanctioned form of lawlessness, a looking-the-other-way endorsed in some form by all of us. 
• • • 
And with that out of the way, consider now the strange privilege allowed to lawyers who depicted pot as synonymous with erratic behavior and aggression when it was helpful in acquitting Jeronimo Yanez, the St. Anthony police officer who killed Philando Castile. The facts of the 2016 shooting are largely not in dispute: At the time of the traffic stop, the school lunch worker had THC in his system and the presence of mind to volunteer that he was carrying a firearm (with a permit, but Yanez began shooting before Castile could provide the paperwork). Having been told to hand over his driver’s license and “just don’t reach for it, then” after mention of his firearm, Castile had been given conflicting instructions about what to do with his hands. He had also been pulled over nearly 50 times for minor offenses in his lifetime, presumably enough to have made the act of reaching for his wallet second nature. 
And Castile never did reach for his weapon, at least if the testimony of an EMT is to be given priority. He said the gun was found deep in Castile’s front pocket. Thanks to the ambiguousness of blood THC levels, Castile’s degree of impairment, if any, was unknown. 
And yet the pot got all the attention. A web search on the trial reads like a farrago of pot-shaming and deflection, a bad crime novel from the 1950s. Lawyers endorsed Yanez’s panic over the smell of weed. They lingered over 6 grams of pot in a jar located where any driver would keep it, under the seat and out of view. Lead defense attorney Earl Gray interrogated Castile’s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds on whether it was she or Castile who had bought this small pile of San Francisco Whatnot, then belabored small changes in her story on the chain of possession of this pot. He badgered her over the interaction of her foot with the dull stash, and circled back to malign her for her daily habit. 
“How much of the $20,000,” Gray taunted Reynolds over the proceeds of a bleak GoFundMe windfall, “did you use on marijuana?” Castile “was spaced out,” Gray told the jurors. “He was staring straight ahead. He was stoned.” 
Does it help us to live under law to condemn a motorist to his death for staring straight ahead? Is it possible that Castile was avoiding eye contact because that’s what a cooperative person would do to preserve dignity after a lifetime of harassment on the roadways? Though blacks use marijuana at the same rates as whites, they are six and a half times more likely to be arrested for possession in Minnesota, or twice the national average. 
This disparity is hardly the only reason for decriminalization — but given the role it played in Castile’s death it seems reason enough. “The tragic results of that traffic stop,” as state Rep. Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, wrote last year on the website Medium, “bring into sharp focus the unfortunate legacy of decades of criminalizing possession and use of marijuana in Minnesota.” 
Thissen was, until recently, one of five DFL candidates for governor advocating for legalization of recreational marijuana by adults (he dropped out of the race earlier this month). My legislator, Rep. Tina Liebling, was among the first in the state House to call for the change, terming prohibition a “failed policy” and pitching decriminalization as a pragmatic pathway to responsible regulation of drug potency and prevention of marijuana use among minors. 
First District U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, St. Paul’s state Rep. Erin Murphy and former St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman (who also recently left the race) have taken similar positions, with Walz noting “the system we have had was that where we looked the other way, unless you’re a person of color.” 
These are hardly the voices of the extreme left: Liebling’s district includes the Mayo Clinic, while Walz is an outstate moderate. Most would move to release all convicts in the state who are imprisoned for marijuana crimes and expunge the convictions from their records, according to a recent survey by Sensible Minnesota. All of these candidates are vying to replace Gov. Mark Dayton, whose opposition to legalization remains fixated on an outdated narrative of pot, as opposed to its illicit status, as threat to public safety. “We’ve got enough drugs,” Dayton has said, “an epidemic of drugs that’s floating through our society right now, and law enforcement’s got to deal with all the consequences of it.” 
“It has no future whatsoever,” said former GOP Rep. Tony Cornish, who blocked the decriminalization bill from a hearing in his public-safety committee. Which is ironic, because it was the legislative career of Rep. Cornish that would turn out to have no future, albeit thanks to a separate social upheaval. (Cornish resigned following a sex-harassment claim last fall.) 
Though on opposite sides of most other issues, Dayton and Cornish were working from a script with a blind spot for the dysfunction that criminalization introduces into law enforcement. The scent of “burnt marijuana” Yanez said caused him to fear for his life gives police a pretext to search a motorist’s car. Law enforcement receives hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from earnings seized through marijuana conviction asset forfeiture, revenue that cannot help but to distort priorities and casts their impartiality on the issue into question. 
From a fiscal standpoint, Minnesota taxpayers absorbed the cost of 9,000 arrests in connection with pot in 2016, or 50 percent of all drug arrests that year. It is an enormous demand on public resources and police officer time. 
And for what? Among the findings nested within a 2017 National Academies of Sciences review of the medical literature at large are findings that pot makes users less, rather than more, aggressive; that it does not appear to cause lung cancer; and that the evidence is not strong for the shopworn assertion that pot use leads to harder drugs. (Illegal pot puts buyers in touch with harder drugs.) 
Pot does have its share of problems. Long-term use is known to produce bronchitis and social anxiety, and at high doses is associated with a population facing the elevated risk of schizophrenia. Smoking pot appears to be a bad idea during the critical period of development that is adolescence, though that is something legalization would arguably reduce. Taking the market away from criminals, as Sensible Minnesota executive director Maren Schroeder points out, protects children. “Drug dealers don’t check IDs.” 
• • • 
All of which is to say that the evidence for treating pot as public enemy No. 1 is mixed at best. And yet it’s easy to see why the idea of legalization makes people uncomfortable. 
I have driven down the freeway in Colorado after that state made recreational use legal. I remember how unnerving it felt to gaze over at a kid of maybe 20, barreling down the road in a beater covered in grime, smoking from a pipe in the middle of the day. It was a bright and sunny afternoon, and it just felt, ahhh, no. There’s a time and a place for everything, right? 
Anyone who has visited Amsterdam, for that matter, the world’s test project for the social experiment of decriminalizing marijuana while surrounded by jurisdictions that prohibit it, knows how a charmed locale can take on the feeling of too many visitors with productivity problems and a dysphoric outlook. 
Which might be our preferred way of thinking about repealing the prohibition on recreational use of pot by adults going forward. That the time has come to take away this tool for the endangerment of motorists carrying weed and the consignment of marijuana workers to dangerous conditions on the street — but to remember, as we do so, that our sense of connection with one another will surely face new forms of stress. Of all the problems with pot that have been noted in the literature, those that seem to stand out have less to do with crime than with human potential. 
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, pot is capable of decreasing drive and ambition. Case studies (and personal experience) remind us that pot can leave users feeling more insightful and connected within relationships, while in fact having functioned as a barrier to self-awareness and as a tool for avoiding interpersonal challenges, allowing them to multiply. 
But none of those are legal problems. You could call them ordinary human problems. And they certainly aren’t reason to bear witness to even one more death of a fellow human for the crime of being stoned.

230,232,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/oklahoma-fast-tracking-medical-marijuana-but-with-pushback/487793931/,"Oklahoma fast-tracking medical marijuana, but with pushback","Oklahoma pushed ahead with emergency rules Tuesday aimed at fast-tracking operations of the medical marijuana industry, but not before concerned health officials tacked on requirements that cannabis advocates say will only slow things down. 
The state Board of Health narrowly voted to prohibit the sale of smokable marijuana and require that dispensaries must have a pharmacist on staff. The board's own attorney advised against the additions, and the changes rankled medical marijuana proponents who accused the board of defying the will of the people. 
""The people were clear. They wanted to be able to smoke medical marijuana,"" said former state Sen. Connie Johnson, a longtime advocate for legalized marijuana. ""This flies in the face of what the people wanted."" 
Legal wrangling has gummed up the rollout of medical marijuana in several other states, including in neighboring Arkansas, where a proposal approved by voters in 2016 remains on hold because of a legal challenge. There were years of court fights in Michigan after voters there approved medical marijuana in 2008. 
But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mary Fallin stepped aside after residents of traditionally conservative Oklahoma voted June 26 to legalize medical marijuana , paving the way for a quicker start. Nearly 57 percent of voters said yes to one of the least-restrictive laws in the country that makes it legal to grow, sell and use marijuana for medicinal purposes. The law, which made it to the ballot through signature petition, outlines no qualifying conditions, which would allow physicians to authorize its use for a broad range of ailments and gives a 60-day timeline to implement. 
Implementation could face strong head winds, though, from opponents in the business, medical and law enforcement fields that pushed hard against the proposal. Groups representing doctors and hospitals, both of which opposed State Question 788, recommended the ban on selling smokable marijuana and the pharmacist requirement. 
Health board member Charles Skilling, the CEO of a hospital in Shawnee who proposed the ban, said he did it out of concern for public health. Health advocates have pushed for so long against smoking cigarettes that it was hard for them to endorse smoking of any kind. 
Oklahoma's interim commissioner of health said the agency is fully prepared to move forward with a regulatory framework for the new industry in the state, although he acknowledged legal challenges are likely. 
""I have no reason to think it won't go smoothly and that the will of the people won't be adhered to,"" said Commissioner Tom Bates. 
Chip Paul, who helped write the medical marijuana state question and push for its approval, said the board's last-minute changes were problematic, but he's optimistic the state is closer to helping patients. 
""Even with a pharmacist on site, even with no smokable marijuana, we now have a program where patients who are suffering can at least get some relief, and that's a giant, huge deal,"" Paul said. 
Bud Scott, an attorney who represents several marijuana businesses, called the board's actions ""an insult to our democratic institutions."" 
""This is an attempt to kneecap the program,"" Scott said, ""not a good-faith effort to implement it safely."" 
Scott has called for a special legislative session for lawmakers to set up a regulatory framework, and Fallin initially supported the idea. But the governor reversed course when lawmakers expressed little appetite to return to the Capitol to tinker with the new law just ahead of the November election. 
Meanwhile, marijuana advocates are gathering signatures for a statewide vote on whether to fully legalize cannabis for recreational use in Oklahoma. Organizers say they've gathered about 84,000 signatures so far and need about 40,000 more by Aug. 8 to qualify for the November ballot. 
Oklahoma's was the first marijuana question on a state ballot in 2018, with elections scheduled for later this year in Michigan and Utah.

231,233,MN,www.startribune.com,http://www.startribune.com/marijuana-trafficking-on-the-rise-along-minnesota-north-dakota-interstate/475105773/,"Big pot busts spike along I-94, suggesting drug is coming from 'legal' states","The first hint of trouble came in November, when police pulled over a northern Minnesota woman suspected of speeding on Interstate 94 in West Fargo, N.D. While the car was stopped, a police K-9 named Disco hit on something more — packages containing 286 pounds of marijuana with a street value of more than $1.3 million. 
A month later, a county sheriff’s deputy made a traffic stop of a minivan driven by a St. Paul man just east of Jamestown, N.D., and discovered nearly 200 pounds of pot. 
Then came the stunner. In late January, a routine stop of a truck for a minor driving infraction along I-94 in eastern North Dakota turned out to be anything but. While searching the back of the vehicle, police found 476 pounds of marijuana worth more than $3 million. 
The busts, surprising in their worth, have some authorities wondering whether the I-94 corridor that slices through the heart of both states and Wisconsin is becoming a major pipeline for marijuana and other drugs. 
“That’s not the direction we want to go,” said Wisconsin State Patrol Lt. Chris Jushka. “We’re definitely seeing more drugs in the state.” 
In 2017, Minnesota troopers seized more than 2,600 pounds of marijuana — more than six times what they found the year before. Across the border, North Dakota troopers confiscated 300 pounds in 2017, up 88 percent from 2016. One-third of North Dakota’s drug arrests were made along I-94, authorities say. And in Wisconsin, troopers saw a 20 percent increase in drug arrests, mostly marijuana-related, from 2016 to 2017. 
To be sure, the trafficking shows little indication of slowing in 2018. 
Several days after North Dakota authorities made the $3 million-plus bust, Minnesota state troopers pulled over a motorist along I-94 in Otter Tail County, and a drug-sniffing dog discovered 200 pounds of marijuana valued at more than $600,000. 
Earlier this month, a trooper near Fergus Falls stopped a driver for an obstructed license plate and discovered a passenger sitting on 300 pounds of weed. 
Law enforcement in all three states attribute the spike to the fact that marijuana has steadily gained social acceptance in the U.S. and has become partly legal in 29 states, with eight states making it legal for recreational use. In Minnesota, medical marijuana became legalized in 2014, but recreational use here and in North Dakota and Wisconsin remains illegal. 
Authorities say they think more residents in the three states are buying marijuana where it’s legal, then bringing it back home to distribute. 
“We’ve never had this situation with marijuana laws,” substance abuse expert Carol Falkowski said. “It’s reasonable we’re going to start seeing more of it here.” 
North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Roark said troopers have made 82 marijuana-related arrests so far this year, often involving drivers passing through to other states. 
Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matt Langer wasn’t available for comment last week but told the Star Tribune earlier this month that “we see drugs on every road, but we have seen large quantities in that area and we are paying attention to I-94.” 
Brian Marquart, the state Department of Public Safety’s gang and drug coordinator, said authorities have seen a rise in marijuana trafficking across the state over the past several years — from 21,208 ounces confiscated in 2014 to 69,236 ounces in 2017. 
“We’re seeing a dramatic increase in marijuana and marijuana concentrate coming from states like Colorado, California and Oregon,” Marquart said, adding that addiction to the drug is “compounded tremendously by public opinion and attitude that it’s not a dangerous substance.” 
Slowing the trend 
Along with the increase in the amount of marijuana seized of late, Marquart said authorities are also seeing an increase in violent crime. 
The Star Tribune reported this month that at least seven Minnesotans died last year during marijuana transactions, the most in a decade. 
In Wisconsin, weapons-related arrests increased in 2017 from the year before, as did arrests of drivers under the influence of drugs. 
“They generally go together,” Jushka said of drugs, weapons and violence. 
Troopers not only are finding more marijuana during traffic stops, he said, but also in the mail. 
In an effort to crack down, the Wisconsin State Patrol plans to add another K-9 this week to its force of eight dogs that are trained to sniff out drugs during traffic stops. It also plans to ramp up trooper training. 
Minnesota, meanwhile, is adding two dogs to its K-9 unit. It now has 16 dogs, the most it has had in several years. Its canine teams tracked down 2,642 pounds of marijuana in 2017, up from 389 pounds in 2016, according to the State Patrol. 
But as with many crime trends, officers say they can’t combat the problem alone. 
“It’s aggressive enforcement, but it has to be partnered with a strong prevention message,” Marquart said. “People say that marijuana is a safe substance. ... It is very addictive. We just want people to stop dealing and stop using.”

			Autism, sleep apnea now qualify for medical marijuana in Minnesota		
","Minnesota residents with autism or obstructive sleep apnea can now qualify for the state’s medical marijuana program. 
Those additions are effective Wednesday, marking the latest expansion of the program that launched in 2015. Minnesota lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most restrictive medical marijuana laws in 2014, banning the plant form and restricting its use to patients with just a handful of serious conditions. 
Patients with intractable pain were added to the fold in 2016. The state allowed residents suffering post-traumatic stress disorder to buy the medication starting last summer. 
Advocacy groups had sought to add even more conditions to the program, including nausea, dementia and anxiety disorders.Related Articles

			Here’s where DFL governor candidates stand on guns, legalizing pot, health care and taxes		
","Farmer-Labor Party candidates running for Minnesota governor all support their party’s core beliefs of fair treatment under the law, equitable opportunity and common-sense government regulation. 
But state. Rep. Erin Murphy, Attorney General Lori Swanson and Congressman Tim Walz also have their differences. Some of those are subtle while others are more pronounced. 
RELATED: Where the Republican candidates stand, differ 
Here’s where they stand — and differ — on some of the biggest issues of this campaign season: 
Murphy, Swanson and Walz all say they support tightening gun regulations to keep Minnesotans safe in the wake of ongoing mass shootings in public places like schools, churches and office buildings. 
That means requiring background checks for gun purchases, allowing law enforcement to obtain a court order to seize firearms from people deemed dangerous and studying the impact gun violence has on public health. They also all want better school security and improved access to mental health care. 
Murphy, of St. Paul, also wants to ban what she calls “military-style weapons” such as the AR-15 rifle and similar guns that are commonly used in mass shootings. Murphy touts her dozen years receiving an “F” rating from the National Rifle Association. 
“Minnesotans are demanding urgent action on this issue,” Murphy said. “It’s time to move the NRA out of this debate.” 
Swanson, of Eagan, has downplayed her past NRA support, saying it was more about the organization’s opposition to her opponent in 2010 than her gun policies. 
Walz, who was a strong supporter of gun rights while in Congress, says he’s “evolved” on the issue because of the ongoing death toll from mass shootings. “I think they’ll spend a lot of money against me,” he said of the NRA that once supported his campaigns. “I’m dangerous to their agenda.” 
Attitudes about recreational marijuana have shifted dramatically since 2014 when Minnesota made cannabis legal for some medical treatments. Walz and Murphy say it’s now time to legalize pot for recreational use. 
Attorney General Swanson disagrees. As the state’s top law enforcement official, she’s concerned about impaired drivers on the road and police being unable to test for marijuana intoxication.Related Articles

“Marijuana has gotten increasingly more potent over the years and I have concerns about how that impacts driving,” Swanson said. “Until someone can show me or convince me there are ways to deal with the driving issue, it is a concern to me.” 
All three candidates say they want the state’s drug laws to be enforced fairly and not have people of color disproportionately in the legal system for drug offenses. If pot becomes legal, Murphy says non-violent drug offenders should have their sentences commuted. 
Walz, of Mankato, noted bipartisan legislation he co-sponsored that would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to study marijuana for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain. 
Minnesota’s next governor will have to deal with ongoing uncertainty in health insurance markets. A reinsurance program designed to keep rates down will soon run out of money and a medical provider tax that funds the state’s health care system for the working poor will sunset at the end of 2019. 
All three DFLers say they support current Gov. Mark Dayton’s proposal to offer MinnesotaCare, the state’s health care program for the working poor, to more of the state’s residents. They all also want to use the state’s clout as a large purchaser of medication to lower drug prices for consumers. 
“People can get discounts of anywhere from 30 (percent) to 80 percent ... just by tapping into the state’s purchasing power,” Swanson said. 
Murphy wants to go a step further and move toward a single-payer health care system. 
“It’s time for us to lead the nation and guarantee that people who are sick get the care that they need,” she said. 
All three candidates also support extending the provider tax, which is expected to raise $692 million next year to fund MinnesotaCare, past its planned sunset in 2019. They also want to explore other sources to pay for MinnesotaCare costs. 
Minnesota’s budget was in the red when Dayton took office and he’s gotten kudos from his DFL colleagues for his work to bring it into balance. 
He’s also been criticized by Republicans and conservative groups for raising taxes and increasing overall state spending during his two terms. 
Erasing budget deficits isn’t easy and all three candidates noted their unique experiences working with limited resources. Walz was in Congress during some high-profile budget battles; Swanson ran a state constitutional office during the recession; and Murphy worked on crafting a budget when the state faced a $6 billion deficit. 
All three candidates haven’t ruled out raising taxes, if necessary, to keep the state’s budget balanced or to fund new priorities. At the top of the list is finding a permanent source of money to address the state’s transportation needs. 
“There’s a hunger among Minnesotans to have an honest discussion about what you pay for, what you get and what our expectations are,” Walz said. 
Outside of specific policy positions, the candidates’ biggest differences are their histories and each of them believes those experiences uniquely qualifies them to be a successful governor.Related Articles

Murphy has been a Minnesota House member for a dozen years and says her knowledge of the legislative process will make her a more effective governor. 
Swanson emphasized her negotiating skills as an attorney and noted she’s the only DFL candidate to win a statewide campaign. 
Walz says his connection to Greater Minnesota, his experience working with agriculture and his time in the military will help him appeal to voters statewide. 
Early primary voting already has begun. The primary for Democrats and Republicans will be held Aug. 14. The winners will face each other in the Nov. 6 general election. Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, isn’t seeking re-election.

			Minnesota girl who inspired campaign for medical marijuana dies at 12		
","Amelia Weaver, the Hibbing girl whose fight with a rare form of epilepsy led her parents to the center of the campaign for medical marijuana in Minnesota, has died. She was 12. 
“Warrior Amelia, after a lifelong battle with Scn2a, passed away today,” parents Josh and Angie Weaver posted on their “Fighting for Amelia” Facebook page Thursday. “We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia’s parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl.” 
After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a. 
According to an article from early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly. 
Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session. 
Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014. 
Legalization didn’t take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state’s two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing. 
By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents. 
A photo of Angie and Amelia Weaver was featured on the LeafLine Labs website, with a link to their story and more pictures.Related Articles

But Amelia was still a sick girl with a compromised immune system. She suffered setbacks and hospitalizations, including an anxious drive to the Mayo Clinic on Christmas Day 2015. 
She recovered slowly, but suffered additional setbacks and last Sunday was airlifted to the Mayo Clinic, her parents reported on Facebook. “Sadly, Amelia is in very rough shape,” they told friends and family last week.

			CEO steps down, board replaced at struggling Cottage Grove medical marijuana company		
","The chief executive of one of Minnesota’s two medical marijuana manufacturers has left the company after years of financial losses. 
Andrew Bachman, LeafLine Labs’ co-founder and its chief executive since 2016, is no longer with the company “in any official capacity,” the company said in a Thursday statement to the Associated Press. The company’s entire five-member board has also been replaced. 
The statement didn’t give a reason for Bachman’s exit, and a company official didn’t respond to questions about his departure. Bachman didn’t respond to a voicemail or text message seeking comment. 
But LeafLine has struggled since medical marijuana sales began in 2015 in Minnesota. The Cottage Grove-based company lost $6.9 million in its first two financial years, and documents provided by state regulators to The AP showed LeafLine lost another $5.3 million in 2017. 
Two top executives left LeafLine last year and it temporarily scaled back its operations in November during a supply shortage that Bachman blamed on lab testing delays. 
LeafLine was founded and backed by several family members of the popular Minnesota nursery Bachman’s Floral Garden and Gift Centers, though it’s unclear if any family members are still involved at the company after Bachman’s exit. LeafLine was one of two manufacturers selected to grow and cultivate medical marijuana in 2014, the year Minnesota’s Legislature passed its law. 
Minnesota’s program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form is banned, and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. Each manufacturer is required to perform several rounds of testing on their medication and must run four dispensaries across the state. 
Those restrictions have made business difficult for both of the state’s manufacturers. An audit last year showed the two companies, LeafLine and Minnesota Medical Solutions, had lost a combined $11 million in just two years of legal sales. But while Minnesota Medical Solutions has been trending in the right direction — it turned a small profit in 2017 — LeafLine has lost more money each year it’s been in business. 
After losing $4.7 million in 2016, a financial audit shows the company lost another $5.3 million in 2017. All told, LeafLine has lost more than $12 million in its three years of operations. 
The company also struggled late last year with supply, turning away some patients and temporarily closing a storefront in Eagan due to what Bachman said was a delay in the state-mandated, third-party testing of its medication. 
This isn’t LeafLine’s first brush with turnover. Bachman was the company’s fourth chief executive since the company formed in 2014. He took over after Manny Munson-Regala, previously a top state regulator of the medical marijuana industry, left the company in 2016 after just eight months on the job. 
Last fall, the company’s chief medical officer and chief financial officer resigned, with Bachman citing “personal and professional reasons.”

			Sessions terminates US policy that let legal pot flourish		
","The Trump administration threw the burgeoning movement to legalize marijuana into uncertainty Thursday as it lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the pot trade in states where the drug is legal. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will now leave it up to federal prosecutors to decide what to do when state rules collide with federal drug law. 
Sessions’ action, just three days after a legalization law went into effect in California, threatened the future of the young industry, created confusion in states where the drug is legal and outraged both marijuana advocates and some members of Congress, including Sessions’ fellow Republicans. Many conservatives are wary of what they see as federal intrusion in areas they believe must be left to the states. 
Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who represents Colorado, one of eight states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, said the change contradicts a pledge Sessions made to him before being confirmed as attorney general. Gardner promised to push legislation to protect marijuana sales, saying he was prepared “to take all steps necessary” to fight the change, including holding up the confirmation of Justice Department nominees. Another Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, called the announcement “disruptive” and “regrettable.” 
Colorado’s U.S. attorney, Bob Troyer, said his office won’t change its approach to prosecution, despite Sessions’ guidance. Prosecutors there have always focused on marijuana crimes that “create the greatest safety threats” and will continue to be guided by that, Troyer said. 
The largely hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement set forth by Barack Obama’s Justice Department allowed the pot business to flourish into a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund some state government programs. What happens now is in doubt. 
“In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” considering the seriousness of a crime and its impact on the community, Sessions told prosecutors in a one-page memo. 
While Sessions, a longtime marijuana foe, has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump’s top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, this change reflects his own concerns. He railed against marijuana as an Alabama senator and has assailed it as comparable to heroin. 
Trump, as a candidate, said pot should be left up to the states, but his personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown. 
It is not clear how the change might affect states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes. A congressional amendment blocks the Justice Department from interfering with medical marijuana programs in states where it is allowed. Justice officials said they would follow the law, but would not preclude the possibility of medical-marijuana related prosecutions. 
Officials wouldn’t say whether federal prosecutors would target marijuana shops and legal growers, nor would they speculate on whether pot prosecutions would increase. 
They denied the timing was connected to the opening of California sales, which are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years. And, the officials said, Thursday’s action might not be the only step toward greater marijuana enforcement. The department has the authority to sue states on the grounds that state laws regulating pot are unconstitutional, pre-empted by federal law. 
Asked about the change, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said only that Trump’s top priority is enforcing federal law “and that is regardless of what the topic is, whether it’s marijuana or whether it’s immigration.” 
The Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and keep it out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. That memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes. 
But the Sessions Justice Department believed the Cole memo created a “safe harbor” for marijuana by allowing states to flout federal law, Justice Department officials said. Sessions, in his memo, called the Obama guidance “unnecessary.” 
He and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers who have taken advantage to illegally grow and ship the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more. 
Marijuana advocates argue those concerns are overblown and contend legalizing the drug reduces crime by eliminating the need for a black market. They quickly condemned Sessions’ move as a return to outdated drug-war policies that unduly affected minorities. 
Sessions “wants to maintain a system that has led to tremendous injustice ... and that has wasted federal resources on a huge scale,” said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “If Sessions thinks that makes sense in terms of prosecutorial priorities, he is in a very bizarre ideological state, or a deeply problematic one.” 
But the decision was a win for marijuana opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action. 
“There is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it’s also the beginning of the story and not the end,” said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. “This is a victory. It’s going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years.” 
Yet confusion remains. 
Jane Stinson, part-owner of the retail marijuana shop Enlighten Alaska in Anchorage, called Thursday’s action confusing and worried that it could harm her business. The change, she said, “can have so many ripple effects we just don’t know.” 
The change reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed more lenient Obama-era criminal justice policies. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower-level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects. 
A task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration’s more hands-off approach, something Sessions promised to do.

			Many patients say medical marijuana relieves chronic pain, Minnesota study finds		
","Tyesha Nelson isn’t down on medical marijuana, even though it didn’t help her with her intractable pain. 
The 31-year Duluth, Minn., woman “was placing all my bets on the medical marijuana” to relieve the pain from the rheumatoid arthritis with which she had been diagnosed at age 23, she said Wednesday. 
She had a dose in August 2016, soon after intractable pain was added as an approved condition for treatment with medical cannabis in Minnesota. Not only did it fail to relieve her pain, Nelson said, it “gave me the worst anxiety I ever experienced in my life.” 
After trying it again last July with the same results, Nelson called the pharmacist at cannabis provider LeafLine Labs in Hibbing. He told her she probably was having an allergic reaction and advised her to seek medical help immediately. 
“I didn’t because I didn’t want to give medical marijuana a bad rap,” Nelson said. “I’m only one person. It might work for other people.” 
Indeed, a study released Thursday by the Minnesota Department of Health reports that some Minnesotans are finding medical cannabis helpful in their battle with “pain whose cause cannot be removed,” as the department defines it. 
“Many patients are commenting how happy they are that they’re getting at least equivalent pain relief without being on the other drugs that had caused such terrible side effects,” said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the Health Department’s office of medical cannabis, in a phone interview. 
“This study helps improve our understanding of the potential of medical cannabis for treating pain,” Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said in a statement announcing the results. “We need additional and more rigorous study, but these results are clinically significant and promising for both pain treatment and reducing opioid dependence.” 
According to the study: 
But medical cannabis still isn’t readily available for everyone, Arneson said, nor is it affordable for everyone. 
More than 1,100 medical practitioners in Minnesota will certify patients for medical cannabis, Arneson said. 
“The numbers are actually quite good. ... (But) we’ve gotten many complaints from the northeastern quadrant of our state about having difficulty finding someone to certify them.” 
Nelson said she went to a clinic in the Twin Cities to be certified as a medical cannabis patient because she couldn’t find a local provider. 
Another common complaint is the price, Arneson said. Although medical cannabis is starting to be covered under workers comp programs, in general it’s not covered by insurance. 
“These patients are paying hundreds of dollars per month,” he said. “The thing that I feel bad about is that this program is actually not affordable for the majority of the state’s population.”

			Legalize marijuana in Minnesota? Lawmakers want state’s voters to decide		
","Nine Minnesota lawmakers want to ask the public: Should Minnesota legalize personal use of marijuana? 
The nine — all Democrats in a Republican-controlled House — proposed a constitutional amendment to ask Minnesotans that question. But the chief backers know the question is unlikely to make it to voters’ 2018 ballots. 
“This is a conversation starter. We are all well aware that our colleagues who are chairs ... are not interested in having this conversation right now,” said Rep. Jason Metsa, DFL-Virginia. “But you have to have a starting point.” 
Just three years ago, Minnesota legalized use of cannabis derivatives for certain medical conditions. That puts Minnesota laws in line with the majority of the country — 28 states have legalized medical use of the product. 
But eight states have legalized recreational use of the drug, all by ballot measure. Minnesota does not use statewide ballot questions, other than by constitutional amendment so the House members are going that route. 
“I do think this belongs in the constitution because this is about allowing, giving Minnesotans a right that I believe they should have and they believe they should have,” said Rep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester. 
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law but, under the past administration, states felt able to set their own laws despite the federal prohibition.Related Articles

Along with the constitutional proposal, five House Democrats also introduced a measure to legalize adults’ marijuana use on Thursday, without going through the ballot process. 
“The world is changing, and Minnesotans are rightfully developing different attitudes on marijuana,” Rep. John Applebaum, DFL-Minnetonka, said. He is sponsoring the measure to legalize marijuana for personal use outright. 
Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat who signed the medical cannabis law, said he is not a fan of either proposal. 
“I don’t support it because law enforcement is very, very concerned. They’re the ones who are on the streets and in their cars every day and night,” Dayton said. “This is one more added onto that that we don’t need in our society which is already suffering from an epidemic of opioid and heroin and other abuses.” 
On Thursday, he said he did not know if legalizing adult use of the drug rises to the level of a constitutional amendment and that he would be interested to know if Minnesotans support legalization. 
“I do like the idea of asking the people of Minnesota... if there’s really an overwhelming popular will for that, that would be something to consider,” he said. “Probably public opinion has changed, I don’t know to what extent.” 
Republican Rep. Tony Cornish, a Republican from Vernon Center and chair of the House public safety committee, said he’s heard from people on both sides of the issue and has studied up on it. But with law enforcement weighing against legalization, and parents and drug counselors opining against it, the issue will not move far this year. 
“I think it’s an exercise in futility,” Cornish said. 
State Rep. Pat Garofalo, a Republican from Farmington who pushed Minnesota to legalize medical use of the drug, said he is not impressed with the measures the Democrats proposed. 
“It is an important change that merits thoughtful consideration and deliberation. So far I have yet to see that seriousness in the presentation of this proposal,” he said. 
But supporters say they are looking at the real life consequences of prohibiting marijuana use. 
“We have to be very careful who we incarcerate and why. Because we affect the rest of their life,” said Rep. Alice Hausman, DFL-St. Paul. Related Articles

Applebaum said that even though the drug is illegal, people are still using it. Minnesota could make money off that use, he said. 
“We should capitalize on it, make sure that it’s safe and it can add some much-needed tax revenues for our state,” said Applebaum. 
In Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is sanctioned by the state, more than $1 billion worth of marijuana was sold in 2016, bringing in more than $150 million to state coffers.

			Minnesota’s medical marijuana: a Q&A		
","Move over, prescription painkillers. There’s a new drug in town.
Medical marijuana goes on sale Wednesday in Minnesota and along with it will come a cascade of questions about the drug’s handling, legality and availability.
The following answers have been taken from the state Office of Medical Cannabis, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, companies manufacturing medical marijuana and interviews with patients, police and officials.
Is it legal? 
Yes and no. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug — the most dangerous type. Heroin is in the same group. But federal officials have agreed not to prosecute medical marijuana use that is consistent with state laws.
So states are free to legalize it? 
Yes, for now. But the federal government retains the right to challenge the marijuana laws of any state.
So marijuana is as bad as heroin? 
According to the federal government, yes. Cocaine and methamphetamines are considered less dangerous, as a Schedule 2 drugs.

							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-Cube_Article""); } );
						}
					

That’s hard to believe. How do they know what drugs are dangerous? 
That is not clear. About 15,000 Americans die from overdoses of prescription painkillers every year. The most common are Vicodin, OxyContin, Opana and methadone — all Schedule 2 drugs. Tobacco kills about 400,000. Marijuana overdoses did not kill a single person last year. 
So is marijuana harmless? 
No. The federal government says it can be addictive, and it has been linked with driving fatalities in states where it’s been legalized.
Who gets medical marijuana? 
Only patients who are legal Minnesota residents and have been diagnosed with one of the qualifying conditions are eligible. Minnesota’s list of qualifying conditions has been set by law and includes cancer that causes pain or nausea, glaucoma, Tourette syndrome, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, AIDS, HIV, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis or any painful condition expected to kill the patient within a year.
An advisory panel is considering a recommendation to add intractable pain to the list of qualifying conditions.
Do the patients smoke it? 
No. Only pills are allowed, as well as oils and some vaporized inhalants.
Who makes it? 
Two Minnesota companies. The LeafLine Labs facility is in Cottage Grove, and the Minnesota Medical Solutions facility is in Otsego. Each will sell marijuana through four dispensaries statewide.
Where? 
Dispensaries will open Wednesday in Eagan and Minneapolis. Others are tentatively scheduled to open later this summer in St. Paul, Maple Grove, St. Cloud, Moorhead, Hibbing and Rochester.
What will the marijuana cost? 
A typical patient will pay $200 annually to register with the state and then pay $300 to $500 for a month’s supply.
Is it covered by insurance? 
No. However, patients on Social Security Disability, Medical Assistance or Medicaid are eligible for a reduced fee of $50.
Does it cure anything? 
No. It’s primarily used to relieve pain, reduce nausea and stimulate the appetite.
Is it effective as a medicine? 
The evidence is sketchy. 
It is “moderately” effective in reducing “neuropathic pain” and cancer-related pain, according to a report issued Tuesday by the Journal of the American Medical Association. It also reduces muscle spasms in muscular dystrophy patients.
But the report said that for many other ailments — including some on Minnesota’s list of qualifying conditions — it is not effective. These include glaucoma, AIDS-related pain, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and depression.
In addition, the report said marijuana-taking patients had a “much greater risk” of kidney, liver and psychiatric disorders.
The report criticized states for allowing medical marijuana to bypass the rigorous approval process that all other medicines are subjected to.
Are Minnesota police worried?  
Apparently not. They have worked for almost a year with the manufacturers and describe the security at the sites as excellent.
The medical marijuana won’t cause problems with arrests, they say, because most of it will be in pill form. All smoked marijuana remains illegal.
How does a person become a registered patient? 
— Start by contacting your health care practitioner who has responsibility for your care connected to your qualifying condition. Check to be sure he or she is able to certify you for the program.
— When your practitioner has certified your qualifying condition, you will receive an email from the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis with a link to register online and an information sheet you should review before completing registration.
— Register online.
— Visit a cannabis patient center.
— Fill out a patient self-evaluation form, which is needed each time you need more medical cannabis.

			Study: Minnesota medical marijuana patients report benefits		
","Most patients who used medical marijuana during the first year of Minnesota’s tightly regulated program reported benefits, the state Health Department said Tuesday. 
The study was based on patient surveys and other data. The program began July 1, 2015, and the data runs through June 31, 2016. 
“Based on this evidence from the first year, Minnesota’s approach is providing many people with substantial benefits, minimal side effects and no serious adverse events,” Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger said in a statement. 
Patients were asked how much benefit they believe they received from using medical cannabis on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 meaning no benefit and 7 meaning a great deal of benefit. Across all patients, 64 percent indicated a benefit rating of 6 or 7. Nine percent indicated little or no benefit. Most patients also reported clinically meaningful reductions in symptoms for conditions including seizures, Tourette syndrome, Crohn’s disease and muscle spasms. 
Patients also reported that affordability remains a problem as the drug is not covered by health insurance. 
Minnesota’s program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form of the drug is banned — no smoking or vaporizing the material is allowed — and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. The state added chromic pain to the list of allowable conditions last summer, which allowed thousands more patients to buy the medication. Due to high costs and an aggressive rollout schedule, the state’s two licensed manufacturers lost a combined $11 million in just two years of sales, according to financial documents obtained by the Associated Press. 
The department’s complete study is due out this summer.

            Traffic stop recovers 75 pounds of marijuana
        
","A 56-year-old woman who was arrested with 75 pounds of marijuana in her vehicle told officers someone had given it to her as ""medicine for her sick husband,"" court documents say. 
The story from Mai Houa Xiong, of La Crosse, Wis., didn't convince authorities. She made her first appearance Monday in Olmsted County District Court, where she's been charged with one count of second-degree drug sales, a felony. 
Her next court date is Dec. 6. 
The case began about 1:45 p.m. Saturday, when a Minnesota Highway Patrol officer saw a vehicle run a stop sign near the intersection of U.S. Highway 52 and Interstate 90. 
Xiong was behind the wheel, the complaint says, and her reasons for travel, her flight and the rental of the vehicle led the trooper to suspect she ""was engaged in illegal narcotics trafficking."" 
Xiong gave the officer permission to search the vehicle but refused to allow the police dog to sniff the car. 
The dog alerted to the presence of narcotics on the back seat and the back cargo areas, court documents say. A search of that area revealed three bags containing a total of 75 individual one-pound packages of marijuana, the complaint says. 
She was arrested at the scene and taken to the Olmsted County Adult Detention Center, where she allegedly confessed to knowing the marijuana was in the vehicle but said she'd been given it as medicine for her husband.

            Medical marijuana company's sales slow amid testing delays
        
","In this June 17, 2015 photo, Dr. Andrew Bachman holds the pill form of medical marijuana during a tour of LeafLine Labs, a medical marijuana production facility, in Cottage Grove, Minn. The medical marijuana will be dispensed in pill, oil and vapor forms. 
ST. PAUL â€” One of Minnesota's two medical marijuana manufacturers is turning away some patients, blaming a delay in third-party testing of its medications. 
The problems at LeafLine Labs are causing issues for patients such as Kellie Germann, who uses medical marijuana to treat her post-traumatic stress disorder, and others who may have to wait a week or more to refill their prescriptions. Germann said she called LeafLine Tuesday to schedule a pickup later that day but was told it would take at least six days. 
""As hard as it is for me to go without it, you know, I think about the patients who are far worse than me,"" Germann said. ""It means being functional, active, being able to be part of social groups, sleeping, eating."" 
It's unclear how many patients may be facing delays in getting their medication, but word of the pause in filling prescriptions has spread among several patients in a Facebook group for patients those registered in the program. 
LeafLine executive Andrew Bachman said the company has plenty of inventory but blamed the problems on ""unforeseen delays at the lab, including the recent holiday, we are still waiting for our certificate of analysis to release more product to our patients."" State law requires the two companies that sell medical marijuana to have their products tested by a third-party lab. 
""We sincerely apologize to our patients who are inconvenienced by any delays, but will never compromise on patient safety and program compliance,"" Bachman said. ""We are actively working to reschedule appointments."" 
The company is also closing down its Eagan dispensary, one of four it operates throughout Minnesota, until at least Friday. 
Minnesota allows patients with just a handful of severe conditions like cancer, glaucoma and seizure disorders to buy medical marijuana in pill or oil form. Both manufacturers have suffered heavy financial losses since the program began in July 2015. 
LeafLine's competitor, Minnesota Medical Solutions, is prepared to serve more patients in the meantime, CEO Kyle Kingsley said. 
""We're going to work with any patients and physicians to make sure that there's no gap in that medication regimen,"" Kingsley said."

            Legalize it? Liebling says let voters decide
        
","A measure to legalize recreational marijuana in Minnesota would be put on the ballot in 2018 under a bill introduced on Saturday by a Rochester lawmaker. 
Tina Liebling 
DFL Rep. Tina Liebling is sponsoring the measure, which proposes a constitutional amendment to allow people age 21 and older to buy and grow marijuana for personal use. 
""The time for this has come. Eight states are already doing this, so it's no longer a fringe thing that no one can imagine happening,"" she said. 
Liebling introduced the bill with only a couple of days left in the regular 2017 legislative session. She said she has spent months putting together a detailed proposal outlining how legalization could be done in the state. She introduced the bill to encourage discussion about the issue ahead of next session. 
""It's time to get the conversation going,"" she said. 
Liebling is also one of several Democrats running for governor in 2018. Her support for legalizing cannabis is one of the issues detailed on her campaign website. 
If voters approved the constitutional amendment, a new state department — the Bureau of Cannabis Oversight — would be established to oversee recreational cannabis use. A system would be set up where individuals could get a license to sell cannabis and cannabis products. It would also allow residents to grow up to six mature marijuana plants and six immature plants. It would not make any changes to the state's existing medical marijuana program. Her bill has 12 co-sponsors — all Democrats. 
Rep. Greg Davids, R-Preston, said he doesn't think Liebling's idea will get far in the Republican-led House. He said there might be a couple of Republicans who would be willing to support it, but the vast majority would oppose it. He is among those who would fight it. 
""I have always been adamantly opposed to such a bill. I would fight it very, very hard. I think in the states that have done this, it's been a disaster,"" Davids said. 
Liebling acknowledged it is unlikely her bill will win the support needed to pass next year, but she wants lawmakers to start thinking about the issue. She said Minnesotans spend an estimated $700 million a year on marijuana sold on the black market. She added that recent research has shown that in states where marijuana is legal they have seen a drop in opioid deaths. Nonetheless, she said cannabis is not harmless, and her bill is aimed at trying to provide protections so that young people do not have access to it.

            Political Notebook: Lewis & Walz find common ground on marijuana
        
","Tim Walz DFL Gubernatorial Forum held at the Heinz Center on the Rochester Community and Technical College campus in Rochester. Oct.17, 2017 
While there is plenty DFL Rep. Tim Walz and GOP Rep. Jason Lewis disagree on, the two are united in their concern about a Trump administration shift in marijuana policy. 
Both Walz and Lewis issued statements last week opposing Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to rescind an Obama-era policy that kept federal prosecutors from cracking down on the sale of pot in states where it has been legalized. Minnesota is one of 29 states that has legalized medical marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Seven states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing recreational use of marijuana. 
Lewis, who represents Minnesota's 2nd District, said in a statement he supports states' rights to set their own marijuana laws. 
""As I've said before, especially in regard to medical marijuana, the federal government has no business sending in the FBI and Department of Justice to prosecute people in full compliance with their own state's law,"" Lewis said. ""Congress has previously passed legislation as it pertains to marijuana, prohibiting the enforcement of federal laws that infringe on the sovereignty of the states. That's federalism, and I have always supported those efforts — but unfortunately, they've recently been blocked."" 
The GOP congressman said he will work with Republicans and Democrats to make sure Minnesota's marijuana laws are respected. 
Walz is also concerned about the policy change. In a statement, the 1st District Democrat noted the Department of Veterans Affairs had recently decided to allow doctors to discuss medical cannabis with veteran patients. 
""It is disappointing to see that while the VA moves in the right direction, however slowly, AG Sessions is determined to take our country backwards. What's more, the AG's decision risks further facilitating the extremely dangerous and misguided practice of overprescribing opioids, a practice that overwhelming hurts veterans,"" said Walz, who is also running for governor. 
Sessions defended the policy change, saying in a statement that it simply enforces federal laws, which prohibit the use of marijuana. 
""It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission,"" Sessions said. ""Therefore, today's memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country."" 
No-frills bonding tour 
Members of the Senate Capital Investment Committee plan to tour the state, looking at potential construction projects after all. 
Typically, the committee members board a bus in the fall to get an up-close look at projects vying to be part of a construction borrowing bill, also known as a bonding bill. But the committee's chairman, Rochester GOP Sen. Dave Senjem, scrapped the tour last year amid budget concerns. At that point, the Legislature and Gov. Mark Dayton were still battling in court over the governor's veto of the Legislature's funding. 
The Legislature has been able to tap into some other funds to keep operations going until the Feb. 20 start of session. The governor has said he is willing to sign a funding bill without any conditions for the Legislature. So Senjem said he decided it was worth going ahead with the tour. However, this tour will be abbreviated, with fewer stops and overnights, to cut down on costs. 
""I'm trying to be a little bit more austere and cost conscious,"" Senjem said. 
The tour kicks off today in southwest Minnesota. Committee members are expected to visit Southeast Minnesota on Feb. 12 and 13. The agenda for the tour has not yet been finalized. However, Senjem said he expects the committee will hear about requests for funding for Rochester Community and Technical College, Oronoco wastewater improvements and U.S. Highway 14 expansion — just to name a few. He said he expects the Senate will be putting together an $800 million bonding bill. 
""The priorities of this bill are going to be roads and bridges and wastewater infrastructure and higher education,"" he said. 
Chamber sponsors legislative preview 
Local lawmakers will share their insights about the upcoming legislative session during a luncheon sponsored by the Rochester Area Chamber of Commerce. 
The legislative preview will be from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Jan. 19 at the DoubleTree by Hilton, 150 S. Broadway, in Rochester. The cost is $25 for members and $35 for nonmembers and will include a meal. To register, go to rochestermnchamber.com.

            Traffic stop leads to discover of 19 pounds of marijuana
        
","Two men from Georgia are in jail in Rochester after a traffic stop the day after Christmas recovered about 19 pounds of marijuana. 
Teandré Dawayne Johnson, 27, of Atlanta, and Trenton D. McMullen, also 27 and of Palmetto, Ga., made their first appearance Wednesday in Olmsted County District Court. 
The case began about 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, when a Minnesota State Patrol officer performed a traffic stop on a vehicle on Interstate 90. 
Johnson was driving; McMullen was in the passenger seat. 
""Based on his interaction with Johnson,"" the trooper suspected Johnson was trafficking controlled substances from California, the complaint says, but didn't explain the interaction. 
The trooper's drug-sniffing dog alerted on the car. When the officer opened the trunk, he discovered a single duffel bag containing multiple vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana, court documents say. 
An unlabeled pill bottle containing 23 amphetamine salt pills was in the center console. 
Johnson first told the trooper he was traveling from California to Rochester, N.Y., then back to Georgia. He later allegedly admitted he picked up the marijuana in California. 
McMullen denied knowing anything about the marijuana, but reportedly said he was taking the pills found in the console, adding that they were prescribed to his sister. 
The duffel bag contained 19 sealed bags, each weighing about a pound and holding what field-tested positive as marijuana, the complaint says. 
The men were both charged with one count each of third-degree controlled substance crime-sale; fifth-degree controlled substance crime-sale; fifth-degree controlled substance crime-possession; and failure to affix a tax stamp-marijuana. All are felonies. 
Johnson remains in custody in lieu of $15,000; McMullen's conditional bond is set at $5,000. They're due back in court Jan. 10.

248,250,MN,www.postbulletin.com,https://www.postbulletin.com/news/business/despite-low-demand-medical-marijuana-companies-in-illinois-are-growing/article_6558e28a-dce5-5bc5-92ec-b160eee0286b.html,"

            
            Despite low demand, medical marijuana companies in Illinois are growing
        
","In a well-lit room in a nondescript building in Joliet, Ill., racks of marijuana plants are stacked, row after row. 
The plants are young but pungent, and sway to the breeze of fans and the overhead humidifiers that regulate the room. Breaking through the hum is the noise of construction. Cresco Labs is expanding its Joliet cultivation facility, more than doubling the amount of cannabis it can grow and process. 
The Chicago-based company is preparing for growth of the state’s pot industry, and it is not alone. 
Despite years of lower-than-expected demand in Illinois’ medical cannabis pilot program, growers around the state are expanding. They’re expecting more Illinois residents to gain access to the drug, be it through the continued approval of patient applications, a bill sitting on Gov. Bruce Rauner’s desk that would give people who qualify for prescription opioids access to medical cannabis, or the election of a more weed-friendly governor. 
Some are hedging, keeping their plans on paper until the future takes better shape. Others are all in, buying more acreage, constructing new buildings and adding workers. 
“It’s a time where you don’t want to be behind,” said Ross Morreale, co-founder of Ataraxia, an Illinois-based medical cannabis company that is outfitting more of its 53,000-square-foot cultivation facility in downstate Albion to grow more plants. “We want to be as much ahead of it as we can, because you don’t know when it’s going to happen.” 
In Illinois, residents must have their doctors certify that they have at least one of 41 qualifying medical conditions, including AIDS and cancer, to be eligible for medical cannabis. Pain is not one of them. 
The opioid bill sitting on Rauner’s desk would allow medical marijuana to be used in place of prescription painkillers. If the bill becomes law, through Rauner’s signature or with an override if he vetoes it, a boost in demand is certain. The state’s prescription monitoring program tracked 1.5 million opioid prescriptions in the first quarter of 2017, according to Illinois Department of Public Health data. That equates to more than one opioid prescription for every 8.5 Illinois residents. 
The bill also would eliminate requirements for patients who use marijuana to get fingerprints and criminal background checks. Those specifications have long drawn the ire of patients, growers and dispensaries, who say the rules have caused program applicants to wait months for bureaucratic approval, or be denied access to the drug based on decades-old criminal convictions. 
“Getting rid of that for all types of patients is huge,” said Charlie Bachtell, CEO and co-founder of Cresco, which operates three cultivation facilities in the state. 
He pointed to Pennsylvania as an example of the growth Illinois could experience if the bill becomes law. Pennsylvania, which has roughly the same population as Illinois, legalized medical marijuana in April 2016, and product became available in February. In that state, fingerprints and background checks are not required for patients, and severe, chronic pain is a qualifying condition. Pennsylvania has approved 52,000 patients. 
In Illinois, where marijuana dispensaries started opening almost three years ago, more than 42,000 people are enrolled in the medical cannabis program. 
Rauner has until Aug. 28 to act on the opioid bill. The governor’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Tomev, said in an email that “the legislature has sent about 600 bills to the Governor’s desk. We’re reviewing them and will comment at the appropriate time.” 
Uncertainties remain on how changes to the program would be implemented if the bill becomes law. Some companies are waiting for clarity. 
Cresco, for example, has additional acreage available, but any expansion is still in the planning phase. The current construction at Cresco’s facilities — in addition to Joliet, it’s expanding within its Lincoln facility, too — is to keep up with demand from the program’s current participants, and the ones who could be added in the coming months. The state added nearly 2,400 patients to the program last month. 
“You want to be prepared,” Bachtell said. “You’ve got to be thinking nine to 12 months out to make sure you’ve got capacity and product available.” 
Cresco Labs medical marijuana cultivation facility expansion 
Boosting the space for plants also requires investment in processing. In Joliet, Cresco bought more equipment for industrial packaging and is building a kitchen four times larger than the space its kitchen and packaging team work in now. 
The need for that additional space is evident. On a recent afternoon, two employees wrapped fruit chew edibles piled high on industrial drying racks. The colorful candy operation occupied most of a small room, while racks of weed-infused chocolate bars cooled in a room nearly. 
The number of Illinois workers in the industry is on the rise, too, both to support operations here and expansions into other states. 
Cresco employs about 145 people in Illinois, up from fewer than 60 in January. It took over an additional floor at its headquarters building. Another Chicago-based cannabis company, Green Thumb Industries, or GTI, has increased its number of workers in the state by nearly 50 percent since January, and now employs more than 160 people. 
The scaling of GTI’s business in Illinois is fueled by $67 million it raised through its listing on a Canadian stock exchange in June. The company raised an additional $61.6 million in a financing deal that closed earlier this month. 
GTI operates growing facilities in Rock Island and Oglesby, Ill. At the Rock Island facility, it is adding square footage to grow more plants, increasing its processing capabilities and investing in technology and automation. 
“We’re putting material dollars into Rock Island today ahead of what’s coming in the program,” said Ben Kovler, founder and chairman of GTI. 
With the governor’s election in November, operators see the potential to attract the general consumer, not just the patient — depending on the outcome. Rauner has said legalizing pot for recreational use would be a mistake. Democratic contender J.B. Pritzker, however, has said he would work to legalize recreational marijuana in Illinois. 
PharmaCann, which operates cultivation centers in Dwight and Hillcrest, has plans to expand here — as it has in other states — but is waiting to see what happens with the opioid bill, said Jeremy Unruh, its director of public and regulatory policy. 
Regardless of that outcome, on the federal level marijuana remains illegal, a reality that has kept some of the more ambitious expansion plans in check. 
Financing remains an issue as well. The main bank serving Illinois medical marijuana companies, Bank of Springfield, pulled out of the industry last spring, leaving operators with few options other than dealing in cash. The decision was tied to the reversal of an Obama-era policy that discouraged prosecution of those operating under state marijuana laws. 
Still, some cannabis companies — and investors — are betting on the industry. GTI’s debut on the Canadian Securities Exchange in Canada and a $1 billion valuation showed investors how a nationally operational marijuana company could be valued. 
“What has changed is that the capital markets are finally embracing the industry,” said Mark de Souza, CEO of Revolution Enterprises, which owns cultivation centers in the downstate Illinois towns of Delavan and Barry. 
Revolution’s two huge facilities together were operating at only 28 percent capacity in January. Now, Revolution is preparing the Delavan facility to operate at full capacity, and expansion at Barry will follow. The company bought an additional 70 acres near Delavan, and has plans to vastly increase its growing capabilities. Construction on 20,000 square feet of additional processing space is already in the works.

            Should Minnesota legalize marijuana for recreational use?
        
","Rochester Rep. Tina Liebling wants voters to decide whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use in Minnesota. 
The DFL lawmaker said she plans to introduce a bill for a proposed constitutional amendment allowing people to grow and buy marijuana for personal use. Liebling said she favors this approach, giving citizens the chance to make the decision. 
""It's the kind of thing that people really want to weigh in on, and they should be able to do that. I'm not really a fan of putting every old thing in the constitution, but I think this is a big enough change. It's a matter of people having the right to do something they don't have the right to do now,"" she said. 
Liebling is expected to join other Democrats during a Capitol press conference this morning to discuss bills being introduced to legalize recreational marijuana. Rep. Jon Applebaum, DFL-Minnetonka, announced he also plans to introduce a marijuana legalization bill. 
These measures likely face an uphill climb in the Republican-led Legislature. Rep. Greg Davids, R-Preston, said there is very little support among his caucus to legalize marijuana for recreational use. He said he is strongly opposed to the idea. 
""No way. It's a federally recognized illegal drug, and I think this whole marijuana thing — we're going down the wrong track,"" Davids said. 
In 2014, Minnesota approved one of the strictest medical marijuana programs in the nation. That law prohibits qualified patients from smoking the plant, instead only allowing it to be used in pill, liquid or oil form. 
DFL Gov. Mark Dayton has also said he opposes allowing marijuana for recreational use. However, a proposed constitutional amendment does not need the governor's OK to be placed on the ballot. 
Liebling said her proposal goes beyond simply putting the question before the voters. She said she is also putting together a policy proposal so voters know exactly what legalization would look like in the state. For instance, she said she would require sellers of marijuana to be licensed so buyers know what they are getting and that it is not contaminated. She would also set a minimum age of 18 to smoke marijuana. She said some might see that as being too young, but she argues that young people are the ones buying marijuana on the black market. 
In addition, Liebling is proposing that sales of marijuana be taxed. Money raised from the tax would go towards chemical dependency and mental health education and treatment. She said she realizes that using marijuana is not without risk of harm but said it is less of a danger than alcohol. 
""Alcohol is a much more harmful drug than cannabis, and we allow people to use it. We don't allow children to use it, but we allow adults to use it, and it has some very bad effects on society. But we've learned through our history that prohibiting it is worse,"" she said. 
And while Liebling acknowledges her proposal likely faces a tough fight at the Capitol, she said it is a proposal that Republicans should be able to get behind. 
""(Republicans) say they are for individual freedom and individual responsibility and all of that"" she said. ""And I think part of this is about individual freedom. If adults want to use a substance that is intoxicating and they make a choice to use it, why should government say no?""

            Autism, sleep apnea now qualify for medical marijuana
        
","Minnesota residents with autism or obstructive sleep apnea can now qualify for the state’s medical marijuana program. 
Those additions are effective Wednesday, marking the latest expansion of the program that launched in 2015. Minnesota lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most restrictive medical marijuana laws in 2014, banning the plant form and restricting its use to patients with just a handful of serious conditions. 
Patients with intractable pain were added to the fold in 2016. The state allowed residents suffering post-traumatic stress disorder to buy the medication starting last summer. 
Advocacy groups had sought to add even more conditions to the program, including nausea, dementia and anxiety disorders.

Medical marijuana topicals, such as the balm, patch, bar and lotion pictured, can be sold legally in Minnesota starting Aug. 1. 
Dr. David Agerter 
Beginning today, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, will be allowed to purchase medical marijuana in Minnesota. 
Dr. Kyle Kingsley, CEO of Minnesota Medical Solutions, expects a boost in the number of patients in the state's medical cannabis program thanks to the addition of PTSD as a qualifying condition. 
""I think it's going to be a pretty modest increase in patient numbers. But the many thousands of folks in Minnesota that suffer from PTSD now have access, and that's a really important step — even if only a few are taking the first steps forward here early in the process,"" he said. 
Minnesota Medical Solutions is one of two licensed manufacturers of medical marijuana in the state. The company has an office in Rochester. Kingsley said he has reason to believe that cannabis can help patients with PTSD. 
""A good number of patients who are suffering intractable pain or some other condition who also have PTSD have been benefiting from cannabis as far as their PTSD symptoms go. So we are definitely encouraged this is going to be helpful for some people suffering with PTSD,"" Kingsley said. 
Lack of evidence? 
But there is skepticism among some in the medical community about using medical cannabis to treat PTSD. Minnesota Medical Association President Dave Agerter said the organization has concerns about treating PTSD patients with medical marijuana because there is a lack of well-controlled studies proving it helps treat the symptoms of PTSD. 
""We certainly as an organization want to support and look at improved care for patients with PTSD. However, we do recognize patients with this disorder frequently have co-occurring substance abuse disorders,"" Agerter said. 
The state's policy is also at odds with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, the VA prohibits its physicians from participating in state cannabis programs. 
It has been just over two years since medical marijuana became legal in the state. Minnesota has one of the strictest medical cannabis programs in the nation. Patients must have one of 11 qualifying conditions, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or intractable pain, to be eligible for the program. And until today, marijuana could only be sold in pill, liquid or oil form. The state's two manufacturers can now begin selling topical cannabis products, such as patches, balms and lotions. 
From the beginning, the number of patients signing up for the cannabis program have lagged behind initial projections. As of Friday, 8,109 patients were enrolled in the program. Then there are the financial challenges. In March, the Associated Press reported that the state's two cannabis providers had lost a combined $11 million since 2015. 
Cause for hope 
But Kingsley said he sees reason for optimism. For starters, he said, the addition of intractable pain as a qualifying condition a year ago has led to a dramatic surge in the number of patients. 
""The majority of patients are definitely the intractable pain patients. I would say four out of five people we see are intractable pain patients,"" he said. 
The jump in patients means Kingsley is planning to increase the number of hours the Rochester office is open, from its current 2 1/2 days per week. Minnesota Medical Solutions has also been able to cut the cost of its medications and offer discounts. He is also optimistic that the company will meet its goal of breaking even this year. 
Even with the price reductions, cost remains a major challenge for patients, according to Maren Schroeder, president of Sensible Minnesota. The volunteer-run organization helps guide patients through the process of getting certified to purchase medical marijuana in Minnesota. 
""The biggest hurdle right now is cost. The medicine is still much more expensive than in other legal states,"" Schroeder said. 
Some see benefits 
Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager with the Office of Medical Cannabis, agreed that cost tops the list of patients' concerns — especially because cannabis is not covered by insurance. But he said a recent study found that a majority of patients enrolled in the program reported benefits during the first year. And the number of medical professionals participating in the program has steadily climbed, topping 900. 
""The truth is a lot of the patients who are participating feel like they are getting a great deal of benefit from it. And in some cases, they tell us they talk to their doctors and their doctors remark on it. So I think slowly that's starting to get the word out,"" Arneson said. 
Heather Tidd said she has seen firsthand how cannabis can help with PTSD. Two years ago, she began giving her then 11-year-old son T. J. medical marijuana to help treat his Tourette's syndrome. T.J. also suffers from PTSD, and she was hopeful cannabis would help him. 
Tidd said the results have been dramatic. Her son has gone from having daily outbursts of rage that included breaking walls and threatening to harm people to a total of 15 incidents in two years. 
""It's made a huge, huge difference,"" she said. ""It gives him just a half second to process what he is going to do before he does it. ""

            First day of marijuana sales
        
","Kim Falk shows the container of medicine she received from the medical marijuana dispensary, Minnesota Medical Solutions, on opening day Thursday. Falk received medication for her son, Danny, who suffers epileptic seizures. Minnesota Medical Solutions chief medical officer Laura Bultman and CEO Kyle Kingsley stood with her while she spoke to local media. 
Kim Falk plays with her twins Olivia and Danny, 6, in the backyard of their northwest Rochester, Minn. home Thursday evening July 23, 2015. Danny has a rare form of epilepsy and his mother is now able to buy his medications at Minnesota Medical Solutions medical marijuana dispensary in Rochester, Minn. 
Less than a year ago, Kim Falk's 6-year-old son, Danny, suffered from frequent, debilitating seizures — up to 24 in one day. And the combination of six medications he took left him unable to sit up on his own or even interact with his family. 
""He was like a zombie,"" she said. 
Now, he has reduced the number of medications and hasn't had a seizure for six months, said Falk, thanks to his medical cannabis prescription. 
On Thursday morning, Falk was one of about a dozen people who picked up prescriptions from Minnesota Medical Solutions' Rochester location for the first time on the dispensary's first official day open. 
""He is up and walking; he's babbling,"" Falk told reporters as she held a paper bag filled with the vial of cannabis oil her son was prescribed.""He is getting into trouble and loving life again."" 
Falk said the process is very secure — she had to show ID, and then she was able to consult with the pharmacist and doctors before she picked up a month's supply of her son's prescription, which cost her a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. 
The state's second location, and the first location in Greater Minnesota, will provide patients with three forms of smokeless marijuana, which became legal about three weeks ago. 
Falk and her family, originally from Wisconsin, moved to Colorado for six months so Danny could be treated with medical cannabis. Recently, they just moved to Rochester to be near the dispensary and family in Wisconsin. And although she was skeptical at first, she said it has changed her son's life. 
""It's very much misunderstood, and honestly, two years ago, I would not have advocated for any kind of medical marijuana,"" Falk said. ""But then I educated myself about what it can do for people and how life changing it has been for my son and our family altogether."" 
'Maybe there's something to this cannabis thing' 
Falk's son was prescribed an oil form of medical cannabis, which is administered three times a day by syringe through a tube connected to his stomach. Danny has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a form of intractable epilepsy that can impair development because of the frequency of seizures, said Dr. Kyle Kingsley, CEO of Minnesota Medical Solutions. 
Danny's condition is one of nine qualifying conditions that makes him eligible for a prescription in the state. Others include HIV/AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. 
The State Legislature voted to legalize medical cannabis more than a year ago, but Minnesota's law is stricter than other states, and not everyone qualifies, said Kingsley. That's part of what drew him to the opportunity. 
""If it was anything like Colorado or California, I wouldn't be here,"" he said. ""This is really medical cannabis, with specific standards and dosing — it's not just plant material to smoke."" 
Medical cannabis comes in a spectrum of differently formulated medications, Kingsley said, which are prescribed depending patient's conditions. They range in THC, the chemical that produces a mental effect, or ""high,"" and CBD, a compound that produces a medicinal effect, without psychoactivity. Danny's medicine falls on the CBD dominant end of the spectrum and has a very low level of THC. 
Kingsley co-founded Minnesota Medical Solutions with Dr. Laura Bultman. The two met during their residency, where they worked together in an emergency room. The pair decided to research medical marijuana after observing patients, and they were surprised with what they found. 
""We decided maybe there's something to this cannabis thing,"" Kingsley said, but he was less impressed with the industry implementation in other states. 
""I checked out the industry, and I was completely mortified because it didn't have anything to do with medicine,"" he said. ""There were people doing good things, but it was very different than what I would be comfortable with as a (doctor)."" 
Kinsley retired from emergency medicine about two months ago and now works full time as the founder/CEO of Minnesota Medical Solutions, which has four employees, said Joe Loveland, spokesperson for company. 
As of Friday, 298 health-care practitioners had registered in order to certify patients from the program, according to the Minnesota Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis. So far, 183 patients statewide have completed the registration process and are able to buy medical marijuana. 
Falk said it was initially difficult being involved with something so controversial, but after witnessing her son's transformation, it doesn't bother her if people disagree with her choice. 
""I just hope to educate more people to let them know marijuana is not just a drug, it is a mediation that can help many different people,"" she said. ""So that's OK if people don't agree, but I hope to open some more minds."" 
Kingsley said the relief he has seen in patients has validated the work he and Bultman are doing, but he understands physicians who are still skeptical. 
""I was exactly like them 18 months ago... I thought it was justifying recreational use,"" he said. ""It's been very validating for the team to see people getting relief. It's amazing; there's no denying [the results]. Kids can't fake seizures."""

She was 12. 
""Warrior Amelia after a lifelong battle with Scn2a passed away today,"" parents Josh and Angie Weaver posted Thursday on their ""Fighting for Amelia"" Facebook page. "" We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia's parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl."" 
After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a. 
When the News Tribune visited the Weaver home in early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly. 
Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session. 
Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014. 
Legalization didn't take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state's two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing. 
By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents. 
A photo of Angie and Amelia Weaver was featured on the LeafLine Labs website, with a link to their story and more pictures. 
But Amelia was still a sick girl with a compromised immune system. She suffered setbacks and hospitalizations, including an anxious drive to the Mayo Clinic on Christmas Day 2015. 
She recovered slowly, but suffered additional setbacks and last Sunday again was airlifted to the Mayo Clinic, her parents reported on Facebook. ""Sadly, Amelia is in very rough shape,"" they told friends and family last week. 
Amelia Weaver was the second medical marijuana user whom the News Tribune profiled to die this year. Jess Blake, a Duluth resident who taught in Esko, died on Feb. 22 of glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of brain cancer. As with Amelia, Blake and her family and friends reported a significant improvement in symptoms after she began taking medical marijuana. 
The Weavers said on Facebook that details for a celebration of Amelia's life will be announced within the next few days."

255,257,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/healthcare/4410944-study-marijuana-helping-some-pain,Study: Marijuana helping some with pain ,"Tyesha Nelson isn't down on medical marijuana, even though it didn't help her with her intractable pain. 
The 31-year Duluth woman ""was placing all my bets on the medical marijuana"" to relieve the pain from the rheumatoid arthritis with which she had been diagnosed at age 23, she said on Wednesday. 
She had a dose in August 2016, soon after intractable pain was added as an approved condition for treatment with medical cannabis in Minnesota. Not only did it fail to relieve her pain, Nelson said, it ""gave me the worst anxiety I ever experienced in my life."" 
After trying it again last July with the same results, Nelson called the pharmacist at cannabis provider LeafLine Labs in Hibbing. He told her she probably was having an allergic reaction and advised her to seek medical help immediately. 
""I didn't because I didn't want to give medical marijuana a bad rap,"" Nelson said. ""I'm only one person. It might work for other people."" 
Indeed, a study released today by the Minnesota Department of Health reports that some Minnesotans are finding medical cannabis helpful in their battle with ""pain whose cause cannot removed,"" as the health department defines it. 
""Many patients are commenting how happy they are that they're getting at least equivalent pain relief without being on the other drugs that had caused such terrible side effects,"" said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the health department's office of medical cannabis, in a phone interview. 
According to the study: 
• Among 2,174 patients who purchased medical cannabis for intractable pain and completed the required self-evaluation from Aug. 1-Dec. 31, 2016, 61 percent reported a high level of benefit (at least a six on a seven-point scale). 
• Little or no benefit (a score of 1-3), was reported by 10 percent of patients. 
• 42 percent of patients who reported a moderate to high level of pain on a 10-point scale when they began taking medical cannabis achieved a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more in the first month. 
• For 22 percent, a reduction in pain scores of 30 percent or more was maintained over at least four months. 
• Of 353 patients who self-reported taking opioid medications when they started using medical cannabis, 63 percent reduced or eliminated opioid use by the end of six months. 
• Fifty-five patients taking cannabis for intractable pain reported severe adverse side effects, meaning side effects that interrupted usual daily activities. 
But medical cannabis still isn't readily available for everyone, Arneson said, nor is it affordable for everyone. 
More than 1,100 medical practitioners in Minnesota will certify patients for medical cannabis, Arneson said. ""The numbers are actually quite good. ... (But) we've gotten many complaints from the Northeastern quadrant of our state about having difficulty finding someone to certify them."" 
Nelson said she went to a clinic in the Twin Cities to be certified as a medical cannabis patient because she couldn't find a local provider. 
Another common complaint is the price, Arneson said. Although medical cannabis is starting to be covered under workers' comp programs, in general it's not covered by insurance. 
""These patients are paying hundreds of dollars per month,"" he said. ""The thing that I feel bad about is that this program is actually not affordable for the majority of the state's population."""

257,259,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/healthcare/4429850-medical-marijuana-frustrations-reported-minnesota,Medical marijuana frustrations reported ,"Almost three years after marijuana was legalized for some medical purposes in Minnesota, some providers, patients and patients' loved ones say the program is frustrating, and the medicine, for many, is unaffordable. 
""I just think it's so sad why we can't set up a program that someone would find easier than (it is),"" said Pat Mullen of Duluth. ""They've got to find a way to inform people."" 
When Mullen's fiancee, the late Linnea Stephan, was fighting brain cancer, they sought a prescription for medical marijuana to counter the nausea caused by chemotherapy, he said. But they couldn't find any oncologist at either Essentia Health or St. Luke's willing to certify her for that condition. 
Unable to find a certifying provider in Duluth, the couple turned to a Twin Cities clinic. 
""It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in Duluth, but that's part of the problem is how would I find out?"" Mullen asked. ""How would I know who it would even be?"" 
There's no provider directory on the website of the Minnesota Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis. The department ""cannot say"" what providers are in the registry, said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the cannabis office. 
That came as a surprise to the Health Department's boss when she was asked about it during a visit to Duluth last week. ""That's a new one on me, that we don't do that,"" said Jan Malcolm, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed as health commissioner in late January. 
Duluth hospitals 
Oncologists are the only practitioners at St. Luke's who are on the registry, said Dr. Gary Peterson, the hospital's chief medical officer. That's not to say that an oncologist would necessarily agree to certify a particular patient. 
""I would think that each individual cancer patient ... would be evaluated individually as to the appropriateness of medical marijuana,"" he said. ""We wouldn't expect that to be the first-line treatment."" 
But the decision about whether to certify patients is left up to the practitioners, Peterson said. 
Essentia Health takes a more centralized approach. Dr. Jeffrey Lyon, an internist who is on the  medical cannabis committee at Essentia, said practitioners are asked to try ""evidence-supported treatments"" before considering medical marijuana as an option. If the clinician then wants to recommend medical marijuana, he or she first must refer the case to the committee, which then rules on whether the patient can be certified. 
An expedited process is allowed for terminally ill patients with ""intractable nausea,"" he said. 
Lyon has led the committee since the beginning of the year, and there hasn't been a single request during that time, he said. 
Arneson said he senses frustration from prospective patients in the Duluth area. 
""We get complaints about not being able to find (a practitioner) to certify a patient from all over the state, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""But we have received a number from the northeastern part of the state with specific complaints about organizations."" 
St. Luke's practitioners who aren't on the registry might refer patients to TimeWise in Duluth, Peterson said. TimeWise, a clinic in Lake Elmo, Minn., set up an office in Duluth two years ago. Its sole practitioner, Dr. Adam Locketz, staffs the Duluth office at least once a month, he said. 
He has certified close to 2,000 patients for medical marijuana, Locketz said, but he couldn't say how many of those were out of his Duluth office. 
Referrals from Duluth practitioners are ""slowly, slowly starting to happen,"" he said. 
The cost 
Income may be a factor in holding down the number of participants from some parts of the state. 
""Most people can't afford this program,"" Arneson said. ""That's just the reality of it. So it depends a little bit on the distribution of income, I would say."" 
The average monthly cost for marijuana patients in Minnesota is $150, Locketz said. 
But there are other costs before the patient even gets to the marijuana distribution center, especially in the first year. Locketz said he charges $250 for the first visit to certify a patient, with declining rates after that. The state charges another $200 to place the patient on the registry, and then $50 every succeeding year. A patient must be recertified each year. 
The costs and the hurdles have created a problem for the state's medical marijuana program, Lyon said. 
""The state has created this system, and they're not seeing the number of people buying their product that they had hoped for,"" he said. 
Nonetheless, state data show growth in the patient registry every month since the program started accepting patients in June 2015. The curve became steeper starting in August 2016, when intractable pain became a condition for which marijuana could be prescribed. 
As of March 31, 9,435 patients were enrolled and in active status in the registry, the Office of Medical Cannabis reported. That was up from 5,119 a year earlier. 
Nearly two out of three Minnesota patients who received medical marijuana are certified for intractable pain. 
Those patients may be able to break their dependence on opioids, Locketz said. 
""Daily I'm seeing patients back who, over a period of years, have been able to use this to come off of fentanyl patches or oxycodone,"" he said. 
But while data are coming from states with legalized medical marijuana showing a trend toward lower opioid use, Lyon said there's still a lack of quality clinical research in the field. 
""Maybe medical marijuana will be a significant tool in decreasing opioid abuse,"" he said. ""We just don't know."" 
Qualifying conditions 
Conditions for which Minnesota residents may be eligible to receive medical marijuana: 
• Cancer associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting

258,260,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/health/4425066-cbd-cannabis-wont-get-you-high-so-why-are-so-many-people-using-it,CBD is cannabis that won't get you high. So why are so many people using it?,"In a lowlit room at Joy's Spa in Washington, Dawn Franklin is smoothing a creamy white mask onto Jessica Osorio's face. The mask, she says, is infused with chamomile and sage and aloe vera, plus one ingredient that she still has to explain to her clients: CBD. 
An aesthetician, Franklin started working with an Oregon chemist last year to make CBD products for the skin, believing that a little of it swiped onto the face could help repair the ravages of age. 
But Franklin also takes CBD in gummy form, popping some in the morning and some at night. Like a magic pill, she says, it wipes away the sleeplessness and the stress and the nagging pain in her back that has left her with a slight limp, though she's only in her 30s. 
""It's crazy,"" she acknowledges. But she insists that CBD can do it all. ""It's just crazy, the different things that it has helped."" 
For Generation Anxious, affixed to its phones and stricken by news alerts, overworked and under-rested, the mysterious substance known as CBD is quickly becoming the new ""it"" drug. 
Devotees whisper about CBD as a soothing remedy for racing thoughts and aching extremities. CBD for those restless nights. Also, somehow, CBD for those listless mornings. 
Suddenly, you can find sugar-coated CBD gummies to gnaw on, and balms to rub onto pulse points. There's CBD for your dog (gluten-free and pumpkin-flavored!) and CBD for your aching feet. You can buy bottled CBD water in trendy, seasonally-driven fast-casual restaurants, and bags of CBD-laced coffee in shops on busy thoroughfares in Washington, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas and dozens of other cities. 
Back at Joy's, Osorio, the mask still plastered on her face, pipes up about her own experience with CBD, how it seemed to quiet the back spasms she has suffered since an accident years ago. 
Plus, is it just her imagination, or do her wrinkles seem to have faded? 
Have we mentioned CBD's relationship to the green gold mine that is the American marijuana industry? (Surprise.) 
Also known by its full name, cannabidiol (pronounced canna-bid-EYE-ol), CBD is just one of hundreds of compounds hiding within the cannabis plant. It's a distant cousin of THC, the stuff in pot that's notorious for getting you stoned and for inciting the wrath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. 
But while the term ""cannabidiol"" smacks of weed, ""CBD"" somehow sounds . . . tame. Like something you can name-drop around Mom, like turmeric and melatonin and charcoal and biotin or any of the other wonder-elixirs that have replaced Prozac in America's medicine cabinets. 
The dizzying rise of CBD is a story of timing as much as of branding. As more states deregulate marijuana, the Reefer Madness stigma that surrounded it for decades seems to have gone up in smoke. 
But here's why CBD appeals to some who would never smoke a joint after dinner: Take a few milligrams of CBD as, say, an oil slipped onto the tongue or a piece of candy, and it tastes unmistakably like cannabis, which is to say, slightly minty and herbacious, and just a little funky. But cannabidiol's effect is startlingly anti-climactic. It's weed without the high. 
And this may be why CBD is legal in many states, including several that don't allow legal recreational or medical marijuana. 
An organic chemist named Roger Adams isolated cannabidiol amid a wave of research into the medicinal promise of marijuana in the 1930s and '40s. He filed for a patent, and in the decades that followed, marijuana growers experimented with raising plants with high levels of CBD and almost no THC, hoping that a puff might trigger its own trippy bang. 
It didn't take long for them to realize that they were wrong. So, so wrong. 
""CBD became known as the hippie's disappointment,"" says Stuart W. Titus, the chief executive of Medical Marijuana Inc., a producer of several CBD oils and products that entered the market in 2012. 
Now, the hippie's disappointment is back, rebranded as the stressed-out modern office drudge's salvation. 
Gwyneth Paltrow's obsessively followed lifestyle site Goop, never one to miss a chance to gush about a wellness trend, recently published a guide to CBD cocktails. One of the many cushy lounges offering swag at Coachella next month is promising CBD oils, along with yoga and vegan food, for all its guests. A writer for the website the Cut wrote that a little CBD made her feel ""delightful."" 
""Some people do want the high, of course,"" Titus says. ""But others are looking for the health and wellness benefits."" 
Which, according to the charter members of the Cult of Cannabidiol, are many. Infinite, in fact. 
""I like to call it the super-nutrient, the super plant,"" says Spike Mendelsohn, the Washington-based former ""Top Chef"" contestant behind fast-casual restaurants including Good Stuff Eatery. More recently, he's a partner in the CBD-infused ""wellness drink"" Plnt Water, which comes in such flavors as turmeric and ginger, and matcha and mint and, for now, is available in a healthy-leaning fast-casual restaurant chain. 
""It's really mother's milk,"" he says. ""It's natural."" 
Naturally, not everyone is buying the hype. 
Last year, the FDA dinged a number of companies hawking CBD based on unsubstantiated claims - mainly that it could cure or reverse cancer. 
The agency hasn't evaluated all the claims around CBD, but some in the research field already have their doubts. 
""I think you're dealing with disease states where people are grasping for answers,"" says Timothy E. Welty, a professor of pharmacy at Drake University in Des Moines. ""So they're turning to this and saying, 'This is the answer.' "" 
Welty has been involved with CBD use in patients with epilepsy, and at least two reputable studies have shown it can relieve seizures. But as for the rest of it - the anxiety and sleep claims, all anecdotal - he's doubtful. ""They're not scientifically founded, in my mind,"" he says. 
So: Is CBD just this year's activated charcoal or functional mushroom? Harmless enough to pop without worry? 
""I would be very cautious,"" Welty says. With no oversight of the candies and waters and food products containing CBD, he says, ""you're not sure what you're really getting."" 
For true believers, though, it's worth venturing into the unknown if it means tossing out the aspirin and the painkillers and the anti-depressants. 
""For a long time now, there have been people approaching a lot of chefs about working with cannabis and edibles,"" Mendelsohn says. Weed seems like fun. ""But is it worth risking all the other work that I have? I'm in business with my family. I do a lot of work with kids. I do a lot of work with policy."" 
Drugs? Unwise. The wellness space? Whole different ballgame, he says. Plus, there's no question there's a market for CBD. ""People,"" he says, ""are already buying it."" 
Franklin is convinced of its powers. ""I've had friends take CBD for the first time, and call me and say, 'Where have you been all my life?' "" she says.

259,261,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4471281-north-dakota-supporters-legalizing-marijuana-push-vote,"In North Dakota, supporters of legalizing marijuana push for vote","Supporters of marijuana legalization in North Dakota have submitted more than 18,000 signatures to the secretary of state in support of a measure that would fully legalize the drug, well above the 13,452 signatures required to put the question on the November ballot. 
Like a recent successful medical marijuana measure in Oklahoma, the effort has largely flown under the radar, with no financial backing from national drug policy groups like the Drug Policy Alliance and the Marijuana Policy Project. And like in Oklahoma, North Dakota is a deep red state that hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. 
Those factors could make for a tough sell to voters in November. But if the measure qualifies for the ballot, supporters are hoping a pitch based on criminal justice reform will carry them to victory in a state where marijuana users have some of the nation's highest odds of getting arrested - and face some of the nation's toughest criminal penalties if they do. 
The bill, as written by supporters, would legalize the possession, sale and use of marijuana for North Dakotans age 21 and older. It would also expunge previous marijuana convictions from North Dakotans' criminal records. The measure leaves a lot of open questions: It places no limits on possession, for instance, and doesn't set up any sort of regulatory structure for the sales it would allow. 
Supporters say that's by design. ""We leave our bill wide open so the legislature can do their job - regulations, taxes, zoning, whatever,"" said Cole Haymond, an adviser to the Legalize ND campaign. ""This bill is by far the most progressive, yet most conservative marijuana legalization bill that will be on any ballot across the country."" 
Haymond shared internal polling conducted by the campaign showing that as of February, 46 percent of North Dakota voters supported the measure, 39 percent opposed it, and 15 percent were undecided. 
North Dakota has one of the lowest rates of marijuana use in the nation. Fewer than 10 percent of state residents used the drug in 2016, according to the federal National Survey on Drug Use and Health, putting it at 47th place among the 50 states plus the District of Columbia for marijuana use. 
But the relatively few North Dakotans who do use the drug have some of the nation's greatest chances of getting arrested for it. In 2016, for instance, 61,000 North Dakotans used marijuana at least once, while 2,513 of them were arrested for simple marijuana possession, according to FBI crime data compiled by NORML, a pro-legalization group. 
That works out to a rate of 41 arrests per 1,000 users, the second-highest in the United States. By contrast, neighboring Minnesota arrests marijuana users at a rate of seven per 1,000. In Vermont and Massachusetts, marijuana arrest rates were less than one per 1,000 even before those states legalized use of the drug. 
Data from the North Dakota attorney general's office shows that marijuana arrests have been making up an ever larger share of total arrests in recent years. From 1990 to 2013, marijuana arrests increased from 1.7 percent of all arrests to 6.9 percent, meaning roughly one in every 15 arrests in North Dakota was for a marijuana offense. Data from more recent years isn't directly comparable to those numbers due to changes in reporting methods. 
North Dakotans also face particularly stiff penalties if they are caught using marijuana. Possession of less than an ounce is considered a misdemeanor punishable by 30 days of jail time and a $1,500 fine. Possession of anything over an ounce is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. 
The North Dakota secretary of state still needs to certify the signatures for the measure to qualify for the ballot. Either way, national marijuana policy groups say they're keeping an eye on what happens in North Dakota in the coming months. 
""Grass-roots efforts like the one in North Dakota are inspiring important public dialogue about the benefits of adopting an alternative policy that treats marijuana more like alcohol,"" said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""It remains to be seen whether it will qualify for the ballot, but there is no doubt it has advanced the conversation and the movement toward ending marijuana prohibition, both in North Dakota and nationwide.""

260,262,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/science-and-nature/4406069-duluth-researcher-looking-effects-cannabis-giving-tobacco-smoking, Duluth researcher looking at effects of cannabis on giving up tobacco smoking ,"When Peter Carvalho quit smoking last year, it meant giving up both tobacco cigarettes and marijuana. 
The latter was easy, the 27-year-old Hibbing man said. 
The former, not so much. 
""It's still difficult,"" said Carvalho, who gave up his habit in May and continues to wear a nicotine patch to help control his cravings. ""Someone can be smoking weed right next to me, and I'm fine. ... If somebody's smoking a cigarette in front of me, I'll have to get up and walk away."" 
Now, a Duluth researcher is launching a study to seek to discover, in part, what effect marijuana use has on individuals trying to quit tobacco cigarette smoking. 
The study will take place in Duluth and the Twin Cities, both prime places, said the researcher, Mustafa al'Absi of the University of Minnesota Medical School's Duluth campus. He was involved in a national study a few years ago, al'Absi said, that included data on marijuana and tobacco use in 10 cities. In four of those cities, the practice of smoking both tobacco and marijuana was more prevalent: San Francisco, Baltimore, Minneapolis and Duluth. 
""And that's one reason why we thought this would be a good study for the community,"" said al'Absi, a behavioral medicine specialist who directs the newly formed Duluth Global Health Research Institute. ""Especially at this time when more and more marijuana is becoming available. More and more states are legalizing it. We want to be ahead in knowing how our smokers could still try to quit."" 
This brings up a dicey subject. For his study, al'Absi needs people who smoke both tobacco and marijuana. But smoking marijuana recreationally still is illegal in Minnesota. Can participants identify themselves as marijuana users without recriminations? 
""Well, everything they tell us is confidential,"" al'Absi said. ""We have a federal certificate of confidentiality, which gives us the right to withhold all information."" 
Al'Absi and others have extensively studied smoking cessation, he said. But little data are available on how marijuana use might play into attempts to quit. 
The purpose of studying that is not just to gain information, al'Absi said. The point is to use that information to help people quit smoking — something that's extremely beneficial but extremely difficult. 
""If you're using marijuana or other substances, I want to know if that will make a difference in how I treat you,"" he said. ""The research that we're doing here will help answer that question."" 
Al'Absi knows how difficult it is. Like many, the 55-year-old started smoking as a teenager. He quit around the time, 20 years ago, that he and his family moved to Duluth. 
He didn't succeed immediately. 
""I tried multiple times,"" al'Absi said. 
Carvalho also experienced relapses. But he has refrained for the past five months, he said last week. 
Like al'Absi, Carvalho started smoking as a teenager, and when he decided to quit, he was a pack-a-day smoker. He's using the lightest form of a nicotine patch now, but went beyond recommended lengths of time for each phase of the treatment because his smoking habit had been so entrenched. 
For most people, the patch doesn't work all that well, al'Absi said — it has a 10 percent success rate. But it works better for men than for women. 
His previous studies show why, al'Absi said. Women tend to experience more psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, when they try to quit. For men, the craving is more chemical, so the nicotine boost from the patch is more likely to help them. 
But the bottom line for al'Absi is the effect of stress. 
""Stress is a big trigger for addiction,"" he said. ""It goes without saying that people under a high level of stress seek comfort, seek a way to alleviate their negative feelings. And if you're a smoker already, then lighting up is one way to do that."" 
One size doesn't fit all when it comes to quitting, al'Absi said. 
His research feeds into what's known as personalized or precision medicine, in which the treatment plan differs with the individual. 
""So that what triggers ... your craving for cigarettes may be different from what triggers my craving,"" he said. ""You have a different life situation. We have different reasons why we smoke."" 
Al'Absi's study is funded by the National Institutes of Health. About $2 million a year in research funding comes to the medical school's Duluth campus from that source, said Dr. Paula Termuhlen, the dean for the campus. 
Such studies give the campus a significant reputation, she said. 
""A project where people locally participate, like this, then translates into recognition that in many respects is international,"" Termuhlen said. ""So that when there are problems to be solved they come to Duluth to say, 'Hey, you've got the people there to do it.'"" 
To get involved 
Mustafa al'Absi and his team at the Behavioral Medicine Laboratories of the University of Minnesota Medical School's Duluth campus are looking for participants in their stress response smoking cessation study. 
Smokers who are interested in quitting, at least 18 years old, generally healthy and who use marijuana regularly are wanted. Compensation will be provided.

262,264,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/world/4457858-canada-moves-one-step-closer-legalizing-recreational-marijuana,Canada moves one step closer to legalizing recreational marijuana,"The Canadian Senate passed legislation Thursday night, June 7, that would legalize marijuana for recreational use, putting the country one step closer to making Canada the second country to fully legalize the drug. 
The Senate approved the measure, 56 to 30, in a late-night vote. It now goes back to the House of Commons with dozens of amendments. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced the legislation last year. 
""We are very much focused on the control and legalization of marijuana, because the current system is not working,"" Trudeau said last month. 
Medical marijuana is legal in Canada, and the country is a top exporter of the drug for medical purposes. Canada would become the second country to legalize the production, sale and consumption of marijuana; Uruguay did so last year. 
The House of Commons must now vote to accept or reject the amendments before sending the legislation back to the Senate. While the majority of the changes are minor and technical, some are large, including a provision that allows provinces to prohibit people from growing marijuana in their homes. Two provinces, Manitoba and Quebec, plan to prohibit homegrown marijuana. The amendment would make it more difficult for opponents to mount legal challenges. 
Sen. Tony Dean, an Independent from Ontario, said Thursday's vote was historic and that the legislation is designed to combat social ills such as high rates of youth consumption and the criminalization of those who possess the drug, particularly young indigenous people. 
""We have a government that had the will to try to bring a sophisticated, complex approach to a complex policy challenge,"" Dean said in an interview. ""The government is being clear that this has investments in public health, community health and harm reduction."" 
The bill has seen opposition from conservative politicians and indigenous leaders who have said the bill could adversely affect Canada's youth. 
Sen. Leo Housakos, a conservative from Quebec, said he is concerned that support for the bill amounts to ""an attempt to normalize marijuana,"" something he thinks will have deleterious effects. 
""Unfortunately, this bill makes marijuana more accessible to teenagers, particularly, than ever before, and it's very concerning,"" Housakos told reporters after the vote. 
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has estimated that Canada could see $6.5 billion in legal retail sales by 2020 if the legislation becomes law, equivalent to about $5 billion in U.S. currency. Statistics Canada said that people 15 and older spent $5.7 million in Canadian currency on marijuana in 2017, even though the drug was illegal recreationally. 
Investment from the United States, where recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia, has been pouring into Canada ahead of expected legalization. Canada also is taking advantage of the international market by supplying cannabis worldwide, said Jay Czarkowski, founding partner of Canna Advisors, a Colorado-based consulting group. 
""Canada is exporting all over the world right now. That should be us,"" he said of the United States.

263,265,MN,www.duluthnewstribune.com,http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/4439014-uc-san-diego-use-controversial-marijuana-compound-treat-severe-autism,UC San Diego to use controversial marijuana compound to treat severe autism,"UC San Diego will try to alleviate severe autism in children by giving them a non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana, a project funded by the biggest private donation ever made in the U.S. for such research. 
The $4.7 million study involves the controversial compound cannabidiol, or CBD, which is widely marketed nationwide as something of a miracle drug, capable of treating everything from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Regulators believe CBD does show therapeutic promise. But they also say the miracle drug claims are wrong or based on anecdotes rather than scientific evidence. Last fall, the FDA warned four companies to stop saying things like, ""CBD makes cancer cells commit 'suicide.'"" 
UC San Diego dealt with the issue by asking the Ray and Tye Noorda Foundation of Lindon, Utah, for $4.7 million to study whether CBD can ease the most severe symptoms of autism, including seizures, self-injuring behavior, and crippling anxiety. 
The foundation agreed, and it is urging the federal government to remove marijuana from its list of Schedule 1 drugs so that cannabis can be widely studied. 
Schedule 1 drugs are defined as substances and chemicals that have no accepted use in medicine and a high potential for abuse. As a result, the government provides little money to study marijuana. 
The listing contradicts the findings of many federal, industry and university scientists who say cannabis appears to be helpful for treating a variety of diseases and disorders, including epilepsy, chronic pain and the vomiting associated with chemotherapy. 
Parents are pressing scientists to expand their research to autism spectrum disorder, a developmental brain disorder that afflicts 3.5 million people in the U.S. Some parents have given CBD to their autistic children, notably in states like California where medical and recreational marijuana are legal. 
""I've spoken to parents who swear that this is effective — but it needs to undergo scientific research,"" said Scott Badesch, president of the Autism Society of America, which is based in Bethesda, Md. 
UC San Diego's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research will conduct a clinical trial involving 30 autistic children with severe symptoms. The children, who will be recruited from throughout the region, will be given a liquid form of CBD that will be provided by a federally approved laboratory in Arizona. 
During the study, which begins next year, the children will also undergo behavioral testing, MRI scans and electroencephalograms. The patients will range in age from 8 to 12. 
""It's important to do this study to show whether there is objective improvement, or whether is detrimental or whether it doesn't do anything at all,"" said Dr. Doris Trauner, the UC San Diego pediatrics and neuroscience expert who will lead this aspect of the study. 
The university says the overall project, led by Dr. Igor Grant, ""will determine if CBD is safe and tolerable and whether it alleviates adverse symptoms of ASD; determine whether and how CBD alters brain activity, neurotransmitters and/or brain network connectivity; and determine whether biomarkers or neuroinflammation are altered by CBD."" 
The $4.7 million that the Noorda Foundation is giving for the study represents the latest effort by the group to promote public health and welfare. Noorda has donated money for everything from higher education to youth services to hospitals. 
Noorda is partnering on its support to UC San Diego with the Wholistic Research and Education Foundation, a La Jolla, Calif.-based group that promotes research and education about medical marijuana, particularly CBD. 
The foundation is run by Andy Noorda and Pelin Thorogood, who said in a joint email to the Union-Tribune that, ""CBD has its controversies as there are companies that make unproven health claims, and their products may not even contain the ingredients or concentrations they advertise. 
""The federal designation of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug is one of the primary enablers of this problem. Unlike other substances whose use may increase risk or lead to abuse, such as alcohol or tobacco, currently there are no set standards for manufacturers. Nor are there clear guidelines for the public as they make choices regarding if, when, and how to use cannabis safely for therapeutic purposes. 
""Our goal is to change this paradigm with research-driven, scientific data, while also supporting the establishment of standardized testing and regulation to ensure that available products are indeed what they claim to be."""

One man. One mission. One homemade dwelling that's seen more of the nation than most people have. 
Lawrence Scible, 59, better known as Ras Ible, is aiming to take his mission to the doorstep of the White House. 
After being released from parole about 14 months ago, Ible flew from West Virginia to Spokane, Washington, and gave up everything he owned to embark on his journey. 
Ible says he was convicted on a charge related to marijuana possession, and now his mission is to promote nationwide legalization of medical marijuana. He says he suffers from PTSD, bipolar disorder and a digestive disorder and that cannabis helps all of it. He started his travels in April 2015, pulling a home that he likens to a rickshaw. 
Two thousand miles later, the Navy veteran stopped Tuesday in Sauk Rapids, where he spent the night in a Holiday gas station parking lot to take cover from possible storms.

But stormy skies are the least of the hardships Ible has had to overcome. After he got out of prison, he struggled to find a job, food, a home. 
""So I started protesting. I went on city streets with signs, went in front of the federal courthouse ... and basically said, 'Please, I need this medicine. I'm doing this to help end prohibition,"" Ible said of his war to support medical marijuana.

The man behind the mission 
While incarcerated in West Virginia, Ible says he studied the law and worked out religiously. 
""The last three years I wore paths around the perimeter of the fence. They would laugh at me and I was like, ‘I’m going to walk the United States. You never know.’ And here I am. It’s amazing.” 
Ible noted that ""22 veterans commit suicide every day,"" and believes cannabis could help. 
""Cannabis is not the problem,"" he said. ""It's the meth, it's the narcotics, it's the alcohol."" 
Suit and tie. Ible's mother Rose Scible was pretty strict when it came to when it came to church and Sunday school at Weems Creek Baptist Church in Annapolis, Maryland. 
""I was raised a Baptist,"" Ible said. ""Southern Baptist, just as hard as they come. But my mom taught me to be an equal person. She worked in a hospital. She cared for whites, blacks, Asians, it didn't matter. 
""We're all one, and that's how I was raised by her."" 
Rose was a combat veteran, a registered nurse, a commander of the American Legion in the 1960s, according to Ible. 
When Rose was 40 years old, she died from cancer. 
Ible was 10. 
""Our world kind of turns upside-down when momma's gone,"" Ible said. ""She was a beautiful woman and I'm doing this in hers and Jesus' honor."" 
When Ible built his farm, he and his wife split and she stayed in the city. And when he was incarcerated, he said he lost his 5-year-old daughter, whom he hopes to reconnect with after reaching the White House. 
""I'm going to go look for her, find her and tell her 'I'm sorry,' "" Ible said fighting tears. ""I built it to be a family farm, so I could raise her ... it's hard."" 
The journey so far 
Ible says he’s pretty sure he’s the first person to pull a rickshaw through Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and, now, Minnesota. 
His route, he estimates, is around 3,000 miles. Ible says he averages about 20 miles a day, and when conditions are right, that number can go up. 
Along the way, Ible has dealt with law enforcement stopping him for concerns of his safety along major interstates and highways, and reminding and informing him of regulations on obstructing traffic. Patrol officers blocked his entrance to California on a major highway, and Washington patrols redirected him to a secondary road. 
Speeding vehicles are Ible's main concern when it comes to safety. 
""I've had cars collide right next to me; trying to take pictures and looking at this thing when they should be driving,"" Ible said. ""I'm getting hit by shrapnel and all sorts of stuff when those accidents happen."" 
Acts of kindness aren’t foreign to Ible, as his Facebook reach continues to grow.Strangers across the country donate food, money and shelter. 
While driving home Tuesday, Tammy Willenbring, 49, of St. Cloud, saw Ible along Highway 10. She was curious. 
""He's a vet, and I have several vets and military members in my family,"" Willenbring said. ""Some friends that I've had died in the military. I have family that's been injured in the military. 
""It's important to me. It hits home."" 
Willenbring, a special education paraprofessional in Royalton, offered food, a place to stay and donations to Ible, in an effort to support the journey. 
Ible has found time to make charitable donations to others as well. 
In Salem, Oregon, Ible built and gave a home like his to a homeless, 60-year-old, one-eyed man, he said. 
“I used my (Supplemental Security Income) money and built him one on the side of the highway and then in a Lowe’s parking lot when they kicked me off,” Ible said. “It was a beautiful thing to see the tears in his eyes and the love and the joy of this man finally owning his own home."" 
Homemade, Earth-powered 
Ible's portable home is 4 feet wide, 10 feet long and 7 feet tall. It's 500 pounds of canvas and wood, and it balances in a way that keeps it moving without much assistance. 
Ible, a wrestler in high school, stands 5-foot-6 and weighs a ""solid"" 125 pounds. When he's pulling his home, he takes advantage of gravity and wind power to help lighten his load. 
""I grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, so I’m kind of familiar with sailboats,” Ible said. “You try to always follow the river, whenever you can, or the train trestles ... because our ancestors always tried to take the flattest route.” 
Sometimes flat is not possible. 
“It was quite a travel coming across the Continental Divide with this thing, because the shoulder was only like a foot wide and this thing is 4-foot wide,” Ible said. “It was difficult trying to get traffic to share the road. 
""Now I’ve got all kinds of special lights on this thing, and a few times I’ve had to shake my fists.” 
Stocked with food, a cooler, an electric cooktop, maps, cards, tools, a citizens band radio, clothes, bedding and bathroom and hygiene essentials, Ible ""doesn't need to stop for much."" 
He was able to build the home because a preacher helped him develop his carpentry skills, ""just like Jesus."" 
Its walls are covered with painted designs, quotes from historical figures such as Henry Ford and current activists such as the group Anonymous. There are trinkets, souvenirs, signatures and, of course, his message. 
He saves items found along the road. A BMW car decal. Tools for emergencies. 
""I left all my other ones behind ... because I wasn't expecting to come on a journey like this,"" Ible said. ""I've found wrenches, screwdrivers ... you'd be surprised what you can find on the side of the road."" 
While the VA considers him a homeless veteran, Ible sees things differently. 
""I have this shelter. I’m not underneath a bridge or anything,” Ible said. 
""It keeps me sheltered from the rain. I can lay fully out, lay down, sit down and it’s totally human- and Earth-powered.""

Next stop? 
Ible plans to continue down U.S. Highway 10 and cut through Minneapolis. 
He plans to go through Madison, Wisconsin, and then Chicago, Illinois. 
Ible hopes to go to the Great Lakes where he went to boot camp, but says he doubts they'll let him on the base while he's towing the home. 
From there he says it's a straight shot on U.S. Highway 30 toward Washington, D.C. 
That route crosses Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland off of his list. 
While he's shot videos during his trip, Ible plans on making a documentary of his mission. 
“I’ll have as many miles as Lewis and Clark by the time I’m done,” Ible said. “And I’ve actually walked most of their trails.” 
Ible says once he gets to D.C. he'll decide how long he needs to stay there, because: 
""I don't totally want live with the president.""

A 33-year-old St. Cloud man could face felony drug charges after officials confiscated 14 pounds of marijuana, 4 pounds of edible marijuana, 84.5 grams of cocaine and $11,000 from a residence in the 300 block of Third Avenue South on Thursday, according to St. Cloud Police Department. 
Sonephet Khamluanglat was arrested Thursday morning after officers assigned to the Community Outpost Services and Campus Area Police Services units executed a search warrant. The warrant was the result of ongoing investigations into suspicious activity and suspected drug activity at a residence in the block. 
Khamluanglat was present at the residence when the search warrant was executed. He was later booked in Stearns County Jail. 
Khamluanglat has previous felony convictions for drug-related crimes.

After all, federal laws, according to Article IV of the US Constitution, are the supreme laws of the land and preempt state laws. 
But wait. States, not the US Congress, are showing greater responsiveness to the will of the people — a core American political value. And James Madison's promise that states must be able to fend off unwanted federal initiatives has not been forgotten. 
The successful passage of state marijuana statutes owe much to the 19th century-era isms that, to this day, define what it means to be an American. Most Americans accept that populism — the will of the people, individualism and deep suspicion of despotic, central governments are legitimate American political traditions. 
With the expansion of suffrage and the use of ballot initiatives and referendum among states in the 19th century, citizens gained wider participation in the political process and populism — the belief that the will of the people should guide public officials — took hold. Opinion polls favoring legalization of marijuana have sparked a revival of populism in many states. 
The Pew Research Center reports that 61 percent of Americans support marijuana legalization. 
While European societies honored a class system calling for persons in lower social status to show deference to their social betters, 19th-century immigrants in America adopted more egalitarian values and a desire for personal liberty. In America each citizen was, and still is, free to conduct his life in accordance with his or her own conscience and to control his or her own destiny. 
This tradition of independent thinking among our citizens no doubt accounts for the popularity of state marijuana statutes that grant personal freedoms and choice. 
Rejecting powerful central governments in Europe, early American liberalism sought freedom from a strong federal state. This distrust of big government is still a force in American politics and, among other factors, fuels the widespread resistance to federal laws prohibiting the use of marijuana. 
Resistance against federal marijuana laws is widespread. Minnesota is among the thirty states, representing 67 percent of the US population, that have authorized the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Nine states, representing 21 percent of the US population, and the District of Columbia, have also OK'd marijuana as a recreational drug. 
To sell the new U.S. Constitution, James Madison argued more than 200 years ago that state governments should have the power to manage their own affairs. He wrote in the Federalist Papers, ""The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite... The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people..."" 
Madison would certainly agree that both the use of medical marijuana under a doctor's supervision, and the possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use by adults, are ""objects"" concerning""the lives, liberties, and properties of the people"" and are reserved for the states to decide. 
Madison added, ""If an act of a particular State [legalizing marijuana, for example], though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that State,... The opposition of the federal government, or the imposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the State..."" 
On June 7 of this year, Madison's words echoed throughout the U.S. Congress when a bill titled, ""Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act,"" (aka the STATES Act),was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and U.S. Reps. David Joyce (R-Ohio) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) ""to ensure that each state has the right to determine for itself the best approach to marijuana within its borders."" 
Senator Gardner added, ""This Act fixes this problem once and for all by taking a states' rights approach to the legal marijuana question."" 
The bill is endorsed by more than a dozen organizations, including the Massachusetts Bankers Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
If it becomes law, this bill will not only revive the Founding Fathers' original view of how states should manage their own affairs, but will also remind us that traditional American values — individualism, populism and personal liberty — still matter.

Marine Corps veteran Ed Erdos tried medical marijuana to ease his pain, and found that it also eased his mind. 
He enrolled with the Health Department’s Office of Medical Cannabis last year in search of relief from the pain and muscle spasms caused by injuries he suffered in a helicopter crash. But along with pain relief came relief from the anxiety, intrusive thoughts and fear that haunted him for years as a result of service-related post-traumatic stress disorder. 
“It works,” said Erdos, who spent five years “bunkered,” barely able to leave his home. Now, when he visits the bright, airy lobby of the LeafLine Labs patient care center in St. Paul (there is also a location in St. Cloud), he wears a big smile under the brim of his Marine Corps hat. He no longer takes any of his old anxiety meds. He has the confidence to get out and visit his buddies at the American Legion and VFW. 
The cannabis prescription the pharmacist hands him each week, he said, “has improved my quality of life to the point where I can function on a daily basis.” 
Millions of Americans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Minnesota is the latest state to offer medical marijuana as a possible treatment option. 
The Minnesota Health Department’s Office of Medical Cannabis opened enrollment to people diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder on July 1, and the state’s eight clinics will open their doors to those new patients in August. 
Ten PTSD patients applied, and one had been enrolled in the program by the end of the first week, the Health Department reported. But some patients already enrolled in the program, like Erdos, noticed their pain medication had side benefits. 
The cannabis oil, he found, offered swift relief to the pain that shot down his damaged spine and knotted his muscles so badly he sometimes dropped to the floor in agony. But Erdos found an unexpected side benefit to the medication the state legalized two years ago -- it seemed to ease the service-related PTSD that had trapped him in his home for nearly five years. 
“The best part of PTSD treatment with medical cannabis is, it allows you to slow down. You don’t experience the anxiety attacks,” Erdos said “It allows you to think. It allows you to face some of those triggers that many PTSD victims are afraid to face.” 
Erdos hoped that sharing his story would ease the stigma around medical marijuana for other veterans. But the federal government — and federal agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs — still considers marijuana a dangerous, illicit substance with no medical value. 
“While some veterans use marijuana to relieve symptoms of PTSD, we believe more research is needed to fully determine the safety or effectiveness of medical cannabis for PTSD,” Larry Shellito, Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs, said in a statement that echoed the official policy of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
“MDVA is committed to treating veterans with PTSD,” Shellito added. “At this time we will continue to dialogue with our federal VA partners on this issue. However, there are no plans to move forward with this until more clinical research is available.” 
The VA’s National Center for PTSD has warned that there is not enough clinical research to determine whether cannabis is a safe or effective treatment for people suffering in the aftermath of trauma. The Minnesota Medical Association has been leery of the medical marijuana program since it launched two years ago, although more than 900 doctors and other practitioners have enrolled with the Health Department to certify their patients to participate. 
The federal ban makes it difficult for U.S. researchers to study cannabis’ effectiveness as a medical treatment. But Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger opted last winter to add it to the shortlist of qualifying conditions for the state’s program, noting that there are currently few other effective treatments available to help PTSD sufferers. 
Twenty-two of the 27 states that have legalized medical cannabis include post-traumatic stress as a qualifying condition. 
Minnesota runs one of the most tightly regulated medical cannabis programs in the nation. State law limits who can buy, sell and grow the drug, and in what form it can be dispensed. PTSD is the 11th condition added to the program, along with cancer, seizure disorders and intractable pain. 
The Health Department is searching for public input about future conditions that should be included in the program. Past suggestions have included schizophrenia, autism and Alzheimer’s but so far this year, the office has not received any suggestions from the public. The office is accepting public petitions through July 31. 
Despite the fact that there are just eight cannabis clinics in Minnesota, enrollment has climbed steadily, topping lawmakers’ modest estimates that 5,000 people might enroll in the program’s first year. 
As of Friday, there were 6,226 active patients in the program. 
That number includes Erdos. After years of struggling to even leave his home, he and his wife loaded their dogs into an RV and headed to the Mississippi Bluffs to go camping for the Fourth of July."

ST. PAUL — The chief executive of one of Minnesota's two medical marijuana manufacturers has left the company after years of financial losses. 
Andrew Bachman, LeafLine Labs' co-founder and its chief executive since 2016, is no longer with the company ""in any official capacity,"" the company said Thursday in a statement to The Associated Press. 
LeafLine opened a care center in June of 2016 in St. Cloud. It was the first care center LeafLine opened outside the Twin Cities. 
Thursday's statement didn't give a reason for Bachman's departure, and a company official didn't immediately respond to questions. Bachman didn't immediately respond to a voicemail or text message seeking comment. 
LeafLine Labs on Wednesday opened the doors to its Cottage Grove facility to show off the place where medical marijuana is grown and processed into the liquid and pill form that will be available to qualified patients. 
But LeafLine has struggled since medical marijuana sales began in 2015 in Minnesota. The Cottage Grove-based company lost $6.9 million in its first two financial years. Two top executives left LeafLine last year and it temporarily scaled back its operations in November during a supply shortage that Bachman blamed on lab testing delays. 
LeafLine was founded and backed by several family members of the popular Minnesota nursery Bachman's Floral Garden and Gift Centers, though it's unclear if any family members are still involved at the company after Bachman's exit. 
LeafLine was one of two manufacturers selected to grow and cultivate medical marijuana in 2014, the year Minnesota's Legislature passed its law. 
The care center in St. Cloud opened in a strip mall on 33rd Avenue. Its pharmacists consult with patients to create specific formulas and calibrate ideal dosages for them. Patients who come to the St. Cloud store can register to pick up a supply for up to 30 days or get questions answered about their dosage, their equipment or registering. 
Minnesota's program is among the most restrictive of 30 states that allow medical marijuana. Using the plant form is banned, and the state limits the availability of marijuana pills and oils to patients with 10 severe conditions. Each manufacturer is required to perform several rounds of testing on their medication and must run four dispensaries across the state. 
A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 
Those restrictions have made business difficult for both of the state's manufacturers. An audit last year showed the two companies, LeafLine and Minnesota Medical Solutions, had lost a combined $11 million in just two years of legal sales. 
But LeafLine's losses have been worse, capped by a $4.7 million loss in 2016 alone. The company also struggled late last year with supply, turning away some patients and temporarily closing a storefront in Eagan due to what Bachman said was a delay in the state-mandated, third-party testing of its medication. 
This isn't LeafLine's first brush with turnover. Bachman was the company's fourth chief executive since the company formed in 2014. He took over after Manny Munson-Regala, previously a top state regulator of the medical marijuana industry, left the company in 2016 after just eight months on the job. 
Last fall, the company's chief medical officer and chief financial officer resigned, with Bachman citing ""personal and professional reasons."""

A medical marijuana distribution facility that has been approved to operate in St. Cloud is on track to open later this summer. 
LeafLine Labs is one of two medical marijuana providers chosen by the state to manufacture and distribute marijuana in Minnesota. Some of the state's distribution centers will open July 1, with other locations opening later this year and next year. 
LeafLine is planning to open a distribution facility in St. Cloud.  It's application for state approval indicated its storefront would be at 125-33rd Ave. S. 
""Our operation is, if anything, tracking slightly ahead of our original schedule,"" said Dr. Andrew Bachman, co-founder and chief medical officer at LeafLine. ""Our initial care center location in Eagan and a second facility later this summer was always our intent."" 
He wouldn't say this week if the St. Cloud location referenced in the company's application is still where LeafLine plans to open or exactly when it would open. An announcement about the location will come closer to the opening date, he said. 
For now, Bachman is spending plenty of time answering questions about how his company's medical marijuana operation will work. 
The company is growing marijuana at a 42,000 square-foot facility in Cottage Grove, where plants will be harvested and the necessary components extracted to make liquid and pill forms of medical cannabis. 
There will be no growing or manufacturing at the St. Cloud facility and there will be no leaves, buds or other plant forms of marijuana there either. It will operate more like a combination of a spa and a narrowly focused pharmacy, Bachman said. 
Rather than an experience based solely on a transaction, LeafLine hopes to create an interaction between patient and provider that informs care, he said. 
Patients statewide this week could begin getting their medical conditions certified to receive medical marijuana. That certification comes from the patient's healthcare practitioner. 
Story continues below. 
In CentraCare Health, the decision whether to certify patients is up to the individual physician, said Jeanine Nistler, director of communications. 
A survey released this week by the Minnesota Medical Association showed that the vast majority of physicians who responded to the survey don't plan to participate in the state's medical cannabis registry. 
The survey was sent Tuesday to more than 14,000 physicians, and 493 had responded by Thursday. Of the respondents, 9 percent said they plan to participate, 68 percent do not, 16 percent haven't decided and 7 percent said that they don't have patients who would have a qualifying condition, according to the MMA. 
The state approved medical marijuana for people suffering from the following conditions: cancer associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting; glaucoma; HIV/AIDS; Tourette syndrome; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; seizures; severe and persistent muscle spasms; Crohn's disease; and terminal illness where the patient has a life expectancy of less than one year. 
That means that many of the patients using the distribution center will be ""quite ill, will have failed with other therapies"" and might be near the end of their life, Bachman said. 
""We want this to be safe, comfortable and spa-like to give patients comfort and a therapeutic experience,"" he said. 
City officials didn't take a position on LeafLine's application to open in St. Cloud. Mayor Dave Kleis has previously said that there were no zoning concerns with opening the facility in the city. 
The nature of the business and what they are selling raises some security concerns with St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson. He would like to know where the store is going and what the company is doing to make the store as secure as possible. 
""Just because they're only going to have the extracted liquid form and pills doesn't mean that there won't be members of the public that either won't believe that or believe that it is just as valuable,"" Anderson said. ""What form it's in won't really matter that much to me in terms of needing to have the same level of security that I think is necessary for a business such as that."" 
He mentioned a recent house fire that killed an elderly woman in St. Cloud and was allegedly started when two men were making butane hash oil from marijuana as a reason to be concerned about marijuana in any form. 
Bachman said security at the manufacturing facility in Cottage Grove and the distribution facilities they open will be more than what's called for in state statutes. The Legislature is requiring closed-circuit television surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a week with cameras that are able to ""capture clear and certain identification of any person entering or exiting"" a manufacturing or distribution facility. 
The company must retain the video for at least 90 days, according to state statute. They also must have an alarm system that covers the entire facility and works during a power outage. 
""We have incredible state-of-the-art monitoring and security that would make a Las Vegas casino proud,"" Bachman said. 
He anticipates involving services such as massage, yoga, acupuncture and other health and wellness treatments. He wants to create a care experience for patients that eliminates long wait times and crowded lines, he said. 
""We want this to be peaceful, compassionate and dignified,"" Bachman said.

Central Minnesota patients who are approved to purchase medical cannabis for a qualifying health condition will no longer have to travel to the Twin Cities to buy it. 
LeafLine Labs opened a care center Monday at 141-33rd Ave. S in a setting that resembles a salon more than a pharmacy. It's the first care center LeafLine has opened outside the Twin Cities, and it hopes to build upon what has happened at its original care center in Eagan. 
""This location is about replicating exactly the success that we have in Eagan, and it's here so patients don't have to travel farther,"" said Dr. Gary Starr, chief medical officer and co-founder of LeafLine. ""And we anticipate that it will be one of the busier locations because it's centrally located in the state. We're trying to do the same great things in a place that is closer to home."" 
LeafLine plans to open care centers July 1 in St. Paul and Hibbing. 
Medical cannabis store opens in St. Cloud 
The care center in a strip mall on 33rd Avenue has pharmacists who have been training for months at the company's Twin Cities facilities. Those pharmacists consult with patients to create specific formulas and calibrate ideal dosages for them. Patients who come to the St. Cloud store can register to pick up a supply for up to 30 days or get questions answered about their dosage, their equipment or registering. 
They can pay with cash or debit cards, but not credit cards, Starr said. Pharmacists behind secure glass windows provide information about what patients receive, when and how much.

The news that LeafLine was opening in St. Cloud brought hope to Mollie Garden. She, and her daughter Madeline, were featured in a St. Cloud Times story in July. 
Madeline suffers seizures that cause her eyes to flutter and her head to jerk back. Mollie has traveled to Colorado and Minneapolis to buy medical cannabis in the hope of lessening or stopping the seizures. She has yet to find a medical cannabis product that helps, although she hasn't tried any of the LeafLine products. 
She plans to visit the St. Cloud LeafLine location and work with its staff to try to find a solution for Madeline.

""The fact that they might have some other options gives me hope,"" she said. 
The trip to downtown Minneapolis to visit the store of the state's other approved medical cannabis provider, Minnesota Medical Solutions, cost time, money for gas and to park and required her to find care for her four kids. LeafLine is about a 10-minute trip one way from her home in south St. Cloud. 
""I just want to get in and build a relationship with the people there,"" she said. ""I've been waiting a long time,"" she said. 
The results of an ongoing study released Monday by the Minnesota Department of Health show that most medical cannabis patients who completed the survey reported benefits from the medication.

About 90 percent of the 241 patients who completed the survey reported mild to significant benefits from medical cannabis. The health department sent the survey to the 435 patients who made their first medical cannabis purchases during the first three months of the program, July 1, 2015, to Sept. 30, 2015. 
About 20 percent of patients reported side effects, none of which was life-threatening. 
“These survey data are based on a small sample of patients and should not be confused with a clinical trial,” said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger, in a news release. “However, these results do highlight Minnesota’s data-focused approach to medical cannabis and the fact that patients are benefiting from the program.” 
This summer, a new category of health condition will be allowed treatment with medical cannabis: intractable pain. The state medical cannabis registry has fewer numbers than anticipated, and adding patients with intractable pain is expected to dramatically increase those numbers.

""In almost of the states (that passed medical cannabis laws) prior to us, 75-90 percent of patients in their state are being treated for some version of chronic pain or intractable pain,"" Starr said. ""So the majority of their patient pool has chronic pain as an underlying condition."" 
ST. CLOUD TIMES 
Doctors uncertain as medical cannabis dispensaries open 
The dangers of over-reliance on opiates for chronic pain has come to the forefront recently, particularly with the death of Prince. 
Opiates for pain became over-prescribed, and people became dependent and needed more to fight back the pain. 
Medical cannabis isn't nearly as addictive as opiates and isn't associated with the same risk of respiratory side effects and death as long-term opiate use, Starr said. 
""Prescription opiate use is a problem that is obviously getting a lot of coverage right now,"" Starr said. ""This is a potential aid or a potential solution. It's certainly one of the things in the toolbox that should be considered.""

The state-approved medical marijuana provider for the St. Cloud area plans to open its dispensary in St. Cloud the first week of June. 
LeafLine Labs has a certificate of occupancy to move this month in to a storefront in a strip mall near 33rd Avenue and Second Street South that used to be home to Hollywood Video, said Dr. Andrew Bachman, LeafLine's chief medical officer. 
Barring any unforeseen circumstances, LeafLine plans to have a grand opening ceremony in June, he said. 
""I know there are a lot of people in St. Cloud that need (medical marijuana),"" Bachman said. ""And we feel we're going to be in a great position to help them."" 
LeafLine has a growing and production facility in Cottage Grove and a store in Eagan where people can purchase medical marijuana if they've been approved to do so.

Statewide, 1,324 patients have been approved to pick up medical cannabis, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. That's well below estimates that indicated that number would be closer to 5,000 by now. 
Bachman believes that opening additional stores could cause more people in outstate Minnesota to inquire about medical marijuana and apply to be added to the state registry of approved patients. 
""Once a month people are driving four, four-and-a-half hours to get to us because ... other medications didn't work,"" he said. 
He plans to engage the public in educational sessions in the St. Cloud area about his products and to dispel misinformation about medical marijuana.

Every 30 seconds, there's a storm in 17-year-old Madeline Garden's brain, as her eyes flutter and her head jerks back. That's how her family describes the seizure disorder she's lived with for most of her life. 
""It's just a split second, but if you're watching her, you'd notice something,"" said her mother Mollie Garden. 
Since Madeline was 3 years old, they've been trying to find ways to lessen or stop the seizures — medication, diet changes and brain surgery. 
""We had done everything we can think of to try,"" Mollie said. 
That includes establishing residency in Colorado, so Madeline could try forms of medical cannabis. Mollie became  an advocate for legalizing marijuana for medical uses in Minnesota, for conditions such as epilepsy or Lou Gehrig's disease.

On Wednesday, cannabis dispensaries open in Eagan and Minneapolis based on a 2014 bill legalizing medical marijuana in pill or liquid form. Six more are tentatively opening later this summer, including LeafLine St. Cloud Care Center at 125-33rd Ave. S. 
In the months leading up to the July 1 dispensary launch, the Minnesota medical community still had a lot of questions about what the program would mean. With medical cannabis, a doctor does not write a prescription but certifies that a patient has the condition covered by the law. Pharmacists with the program  then determine the type of treatment and dosage. 
CentraCare and HealthPartners clinics allow their providers to qualify patients if they want. 
But that's not an option for providers working at St. Cloud Hospital, said Dr. Mark Matthias, St. Cloud Hospital's vice president of medical affairs. Because marijuana is still illegal by federal law, the federal agencies that certify hospitals don't recognize the state law allowing medical cannabis. 
HealthPartners is still developing a system to assess patients for the program, said Patrick Strait, senior communications consultant 
Dr. Arthur Wineman, department head of family medicine at HealthPartners and regional medical director, said many providers are free to join the registry but many are waiting to see how things go. 
""There's very low evidence that it can help some patients, but on the other hand, the risks associated with use are fairly low,"" he said. 
HealthPartners hopes to work with the state to coordinate research on medical cannabis. 
Wineman said this change is unlike many others in medicine, in that it's political and has a lot of emotion surrounding it. He's also surprised by how many patients don't consider marijuana an illegal drug. He suspects doctors may be more comfortable as they see patients who have benefited. 
""It seems to me ... more like same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""There was a strong opinion one way that changed fairly rapidly."" 
Adding to the confusion is a tight timetable, as the state finalized details as late as May. 
Small studies have shown medical cannabis to be effective, but research has been limited because of marijuana's legal status, said Dr. George Morris, medical director for CentraCare Clinic. 
Across the state, 203 medical professionals were registered as of Tuesday to qualify patients for the program. As of Tuesday, 65 patients were registered to pick up medical cannabis Wednesday. 
Many medical professionals are ""not willing to be the first person to be trying this,"" Morris said. They want to make sure the experimental treatments are safe and effective. 
Morris and Matthias expect CentraCare could  re-evaluate its policies in three to six months. And during that time, they'll collect data on safety and efficacy. 
The Minnesota Hospital Association has been working closely with hospitals and health care systems on what Morris describes as the most controversial health care issue he has witnessed. 
People have also been looking to a small number of health systems in Minnesota that are researching with medical cannabis, like the Mayo Clinic, despite the inconsistencies between state and federal law. 
If the Garden family chooses, they could seek out a doctor to register  Madeline as a patient with a qualifying condition. 
Madeline, who loves Spider-Man, the Minion movies and her dog Cooper, functions rather highly, Molly explains. She's able to walk, bike and run, and plays baseball and hockey. But the constant interruptions in her brain have left their mark. Developmentally, her brain functions like a second- or third-grader. 
It's not a leap to figure out why: Imagine if your train of thought was interrupted every 30 seconds, Mollie said. 
So Madeline is impulsive and has a lack of focus. She can be loud. She has a hard time with the concepts of money and time. But she also loves her place on the Miracle League baseball teams, and makes her family laugh. 
""She's frustrating, but entertaining,"" Mollie said. And because of Madeline, Mollie says her three youngest kids are learning patience, and a sense of humor. 
Over the years, the family has tried different kinds of medication, diet changes and brain surgery. 
""When ... medical cannabis came up, we did our research and decided to try,"" she said. 
So the family established residency in Colorado, where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use. 
""We're not some ... people giving our kids weed and smoking up,"" she said. ""We're not trying to hurt her in any way. But we are willing to try these things."" 
Now, the family has oil derived from the marijuana plant on hand. Mollie injects capsules with the oil, which Madeline takes morning and night. 
And still, they're not sure if it's helping. With marijuana, and with seizures, it takes a lot of trial and error. 
""There's so many variables to take into consideration,"" she said. They're hoping they just haven't found the right dose. There's also another extract from the plant they could try. They also know that every person's seizure disorder is a little different, and treatment is individualized. 
The Garden family is still hoping to see some relief for Madeline. If they have to move to Colorado again to try another form of medical cannabis not allowed in Minnesota, they will. But they'd rather not, with Madeline's three younger siblings in area schools and their jobs here. 
""There are a lot of unknowns. I hope nobody abuses the system,"" Mollie said. ""We've been fighting this battle for so long. We're open to anything.""

Who qualifies? 
To receive medical cannabis, a doctor must certify that a patient has one of nine specific medical conditions: 
•Cancer associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia  (severe wasting). 
•Glaucoma. 
•HIV/AIDS. 
•Tourette syndrome. 
•Lou Gehrig's disease. 
•Seizures, including those characteristic of epilepsy. 
•Severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis. 
•Crohn's disease. 
•Terminal illness, with a life expectancy of less than one year, if the illness or treatment produces severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, cachexia  (severe wasting). 
Patients then register with the state Department of Health and pay a $200 annual fee. After each visit to a dispensary, they must submit an online self-evaluation form before they can get more medicine.

Colleges around the country, including the University of Minnesota, have seen a drop in drinking paired with more marijuana use. 
While alcohol use has declined at the University in the past decade, marijuana use continues to rise despite a lack of smoking in those under 18. However, national and area experts still don’t know for certain what causes this trend. 
High-risk drinking at the University has decreased nearly 10 percent since 2001. The total number of students consuming alcohol fell about 6 percent in the same period. 
There aren’t many anti-drug or alcohol outreach efforts at the University, said Dave Golden, Boynton Health public health and communications director, adding the pushes are often ineffective with students. 
“We don’t reach out and say ‘hey we have these services’ because that doesn’t work. People need to be able to find these services when they need them ... really most of what we see is referrals where they’ve gotten into some level of trouble,” Golden said. 
Beyond AlcoholEdu — the online program on alcohol use required for new students — there are few to no prevention efforts on campus, but some groups like Student Legal Services are looking to start new programs. 
There is no punishment for students who don’t complete the AlcoholEdu program, Golden said. 
He said, to his knowledge, that there are no campus programs specifically targeting drugs other than alcohol. But if a student is caught violating a drug policy, they are placed in a program designed to help them rather than punish them. 
Any student who gets a checkup at Boynton is given a series of questions which can cause them to be sent to a drug counselor, Golden said. 
Alcohol prevention efforts at the University are directed by the Alcohol Abuse and Prevention Committee. 
The University tries to help students in trouble with alcohol or marijuana use after the fact. SLS refers students to alternative punishment methods — like community service — that don’t leave a mark on their permanent record, said Mark Karon, the University SLS director and APAP committee member. 
Citations for underage drinking have also dropped over the past few years, Karon said, but this is likely due to 2013’s medical amnesty law, which grants immunity to those who call 911 for alcohol overdoses, rather than a drop in drinking. 
He said SLS and the University of Minnesota Police Department have educated University community advisors in residence halls on medical amnesty during their training. 
Meanwhile, marijuana use has risen since 2007 both nationally and at the University. 
While fewer people under 18 smoke marijuana, total use has grown, with more than an estimated 22.2 million people using the drug in the last 30 days. 
Researchers are unsure if marijuana affects alcohol trends, said Kimberly Johnson, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration director. 
Some studies show marijuana replaces alcohol use, but others show they are used together, Johnson said. 
She said she thinks young people are using marijuana less because of national prevention programs, which delay the age people start using the drug. 
“Delaying is good,” Johnson said. “Every year you can delay use ... is preventing future substance abuse.” 
ThanhVan Vu, a Boynton drug counselor, said she’s seen cases where a social drinking environment triggers a student to try marijuana for the first time, which could lead to future use. 
“I would suspect that we’re going to see more and more cases of marijuana ... and I think my colleagues would agree with that,” she said. 
Most students sent to counseling have violations, Vu said. But those sent for marijuana use often don’t see it as a problem and often consider it a solution to personal distress.

Next month, Minnesotans with post-traumatic stress disorder will be able to register for cannabis-based therapy. 
Minnesota is now the 25th state to recognize PTSD as a cannabis-treatable condition after the Office of Medical Cannabis opened registration July 1, and patients will start receiving the medication Aug. 1. Experts say conflicts in the medical community may still prevent widespread treatment. 
“I think people who are open-minded will look at this as another tool in the toolbox for patients,” said OMC Director Michelle Larson. 
To register for treatment, Larson said patients must be certified by a physician. 
Patients will then be directed to a patient care center, where they can get prescriptions from one of the state’s manufacturers, Leafline Labs or Minnesota Medical Solutions, a Vireo Health company. The prescriptions are refillable on a monthly basis. 
Though the process itself is straightforward, Larson said, many barriers still exist to those with PTSD seeking care. 
The first hurdle is simply education, said Sarah Overby, medical science liaison for Minnesota Medical Solutions. 
Despite the limited care available to PTSD patients, few are aware medical cannabis is a treatment option, and few physicians actually suggest it, she said. 
Even if a patient is aware of the therapy, getting certified by a physician is complicated. 
Gary Starr, chief medical officer at Leafline Labs, said doctors hesitate to certify patients for medical cannabis due to a lack of understanding of the drug, internalized biases against it and worries that their reputation will suffer from repeated certifications. 
This division in the medical community has and will continue to make certification for PTSD communities especially difficult, Starr said. 
Most notably, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, a main medical provider for a community widely affected by PTSD, has historically prohibited doctors from certifying patients for medical cannabis, he said. 
If this trend continues, veterans seeking care may be forced to get certification from someone other than their primary physician, which complicates the process, Starr said. 
To address this disconnect in the medical community, Larson and Overby said their teams are doing outreach to give medical professionals the cannabis education they didn’t get in medical school — due to the drug’s legal classification, it has not been included in standard curriculum. 
Starr said physicians should also understand cannabis’ positive side effects. 
PTSD patients often turn to self-medication due to the lack of official resources available to them, he said. 
“The reality is that a lot of people with PTSD are using street marijuana right now, and if they do, they don’t know what’s in it,” said Thomas Arneson, research manager at OMC. 
Overby said official therapy could also help self-medicating PTSD patients ditch dangerous self-medications like opioids and alcohol. 
Despite these challenges, Larson said she’s hopeful the new expansion will continue to improve the lives of Minnesotans. 
“This is my first time in public health where I’m seeing people’s lives actually changing,” she said.

The Minnesota Daily's 2016 Election Guide left out necessary information, leaving the false impression that University-area voters can only choose a Republican or a DFL candidate for Congress. 
You completely failed to mention the Legal Marijuana Now Party candidates, namely Susan Pendergast Sindt in the 4th congressional district and Dennis Schuller in the 5th congressional district.  Their names are on the ballot and votes for them will be counted. 
Minnesota has the strongest third party history of any state, going back to the Greenback, the Prohibition, and the People's parties in the 1800s. 
Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party nominee Theodore Roosevelt carried Minnesota in 1912.  Ninety years ago, Minneapolis had a Socialist mayor.  In the 1930s, numerous Farmer-Labor Party candidates were elected to Congress, Senate, and governor's office.  (The Farmer-Labor merger with the Democrats in 1944 formed what is still known as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party). 
In 1992, Reform Party candidate Ross Perot polled well over 20 percent of the Minnesota vote for president, and in 1998 the Reform Party's Jesse Ventura was elected governor. 
Minnesota defines major parties as those receiving 5 percent or more of the statewide vote, and the Green Party and Independence Party both had major party status in recent years along with the Republicans and DFL. 
Third parties don't typically succeed in electing candidates, but they serve to introduce new or controversial political issues and may help dissolve political stagnation or dislodge political gridlock. 
You owe it to your readers, as well as to candidates Schuller and Sindt, to correct the oversight in your Election Guide.

Potential users of medical marijuana in Minnesota are likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or cancer, according to a Minnesota Department of Health press release. 
The results are based on an online survey of 1,361 people who may participate in the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program, MDH said. 
The survey showed 70 percent of people would likely participate in the medical marijuana program, compared to 7 percent who do not plan on registering, according to the press release. 
Over half of the survey respondents said they receive government aid like Social Security disability or Medicaid, MDH said. 
Medical marijuana will become available to patients beginning July 1 from eight dispensaries statewide, the release said. 
Up to 5,000 patients could be eligible to receive medical marijuana, according to MPR News. 
The release says the sample is not representative of all medical marijuana users in Minnesota.

Larry Kahlow poses for a portrait in Eagle Magic and Joke Store on Friday, March 24, 2017. The shop opened in 1899 and is the longest continually running magic shop in the country. 
Situated in Burnsville, the “oldest magic shop in America” has all the supplies necessary to craft the perfect April Fools’ Day. 
The rows of shelves and showcases in Eagle Magic and Joke Store are full of everything from Chinese linking rings and snake cans, to mysterious tubes and decks of cards. 
While the hundreds of items may seem daunting at first, the store’s owner, Larry Kahlow, has helped anyone and everyone from behind the counter since 1971. 
""I've had many hundreds of thousands of conversations with people regarding this stuff,” Kahlow said. “It's fun to see people that I started out [in tricks] 46 years ago still being interested in this. I start someone out every day."" 
Having worked at the shop for nearly five decades, Kahlow doesn’t just sell tricks — he teaches how they work. He provides mentorship to those who want to learn, which is something you can’t always get at other joke shops or online. 
""I'm helping you with the how-to and the real thing,” he said. “I'm a magician.” 
But don’t go into the store expecting to learn all of magic’s greatest secrets. Kahlow will likely start beginners off with tricks like Hot Rods or Cups and Balls, which are both under $15.  He won’t sell tricks to people who aren’t ready for them. 
Larry Kahlow shows a boy different gag gifts to give out at his birthday party in Eagle Magic and Joke Store on Friday, March 24, 2017. 
While Kahlow said anyone can do magic, being successful at it is just like learning to play the piano — you have to start with the basics and respect the art’s process. 
“You can get three or four things and pull them off,” the 66-year-old said. “It doesn't matter when you get started being interested in magic tricks, but the sooner the better."" 
At 10 years old, Kahlow would frequent Eagle Magic when it was located in downtown Minneapolis. The beginner magic kits, snake cans, joy buzzers and whoopee cushions had him hooked. Five years later, he was putting on his own magic shows and making money for himself. 
""By the time I was 15 I knew what I was going to do, and I did it,” Kahlow said. He started working at the store soon after and has only learned more since. 
Kahlow has been with Eagle Magic through many location and inventory changes. One thing, however, has stayed the same: the shop’s success. 
Eagle Magic’s reputation has allowed Kahlow to hang out in the shop with Muhammad Ali, get to know former Gophers football coach and frequent customer, Lou Holtz, and sell over 200 stink bombs to ZZ Top’s lead vocalist, Billy Gibbons. 
Despite a lack of advertising and a relatively small sign outside the store, he said magic is a self-sufficient enterprise. Those who are interested find their way down there. 
""People don't listen to advertising for tires unless they need tires,"" he said. ""When someone needed to do something, Eagle Magic Store was known for having the Groucho glasses or having a big, foam cowboy hat or large toothbrush.” 
For 118 years, Eagle Magic and Joke Store has been one of the best place to go for magicians in the Twin Cities. If they need something of the magical variety, they go to Kahlow. 
Where else would they go if they need one, 18-inch, red, silk handkerchief? 
“They come here to get it,” Kahlow said. 
""I don't have a boat. I don't have a cabin. I don't have leather pants. I don't smoke marijuana. I just want this stuff,"" says Larry Kahlow, speaking fondly of the wide array of magic tricks available in his store, Eagle Magic.

With the suspension of Delta Upsilon last month over sexual assault allegations and alcohol and substance misuse, renewed attention has been leveraged on the greek life community’s response to sexual assault.
While University of Minnesota fraternity leaders condemn acts of sexual violence, they say they’re not adequately prepared to tackle the issue on campus.
“It’s a much bigger issue than what [the Interfraternity Council] is equipped to handle,” said IFC president Simon Beck, adding that he thinks sexual assaults in fraternities represent one “bad apple” rather than a culture. 
Holding signs that read “I believe the survivor” and “Silence secrets does not equal brotherhood,” a group of about 80 protesters marched along fraternity row on University Avenue Southeast Saturday to speak out against campus sexual assault.
“This isn’t just about women, it’s about toxic masculinity and how pervasive that is within the fraternity system,” said Sarah Super — an advocate for sexual assault survivors — who founded the campaign, Break the Silence Day, and organized the Saturday protest. 
Haleigh Ortmeier-Clarke met her rapist on Tinder.
For a week, the two chatted about school and their mutual greek life connection. They planned a date on a Friday night in mid-October — and she told him she wasn’t interested in sex.
But when Ortmeier-Clarke’s perpetrator arrived at her apartment in Stadium Village, he smelled of alcohol and stumbled over his words. 
Kayla Pederson promised herself she wouldn’t drink too much at Delta Upsilon’s spring formal in late March 2015.
At a cabin tucked away in northwest Minnesota, the University of Minnesota graduate — then a junior — stayed mostly sober Friday night. She fell asleep on a couch and woke up the next day feeling at ease.
So when the sun set Saturday, Pederson downed a little more. 
The University of Minnesota’s Delta Upsilon fraternity chapter was suspended Friday after a member alerted international representatives about multiple sexual assaults committed by members in the last two years.
Delta Upsilon’s international offices notified the University’s chapter by email Friday of the temporary suspension for “serious violations of the Fraternity’s ideals and principles.” The email didn’t specify the nature of the violations.
The chapter was ordered to cease all operations until an investigation is completed, according to the email.
Fraternity officials suspended the chapter four days after it was told by a member of the University’s chapter that the Minnesota Daily had learned of issues — which included multiple sexual assaults — within the house, said Dawson Kimyon, physics senior and the member of Delta Upsilon who reached out to the fraternity’s headquarters.
At least three sexual assault reports involving Delta Upsilon members were investigated by the University in the last two years, according to sexual misconduct data obtained through public records requests.
Two Delta Upsilon members were sanctioned by the University last spring for committing the three sexual assaults at chapter events in the spring of 2015.
One member was expelled from the University after he was found responsible by the school for committing at least two sexual assaults that year. 
Six of the 10 Gophers football players accused of sexual misconduct have been sanctioned by a University panel.
Ray Buford, Kiante Hardin, Dior Johnson and Tamarion Johnson have been expelled from the University. 
A woman reported a sexual assault to the Minneapolis Police Department four months ago, and a storm ensued, roiling the University of Minnesota’s Athletics Department over winter break.
Prior to the suspension of 10 University of Minnesota football players connected to the alleged assault, restraining orders were served and lifted, and angry reactions from Gophers players spawned a turnover in team leadership.
Now, the team will kick off their 2017 season under P.J. 
In the last six days, 10 players on the Gophers football team received an athletics suspension, the entire 126-player team boycotted football activities and, in a less-than-48-hour turn of events, the team ceased its protest.
The 10 players were suspended from all football activities Tuesday after a University of Minnesota investigation linked them to an alleged Sept. 
In his first public appearance since the football team announced the end of their boycott Saturday, Gophers football head coach Tracy Claeys dwelled on the reason behind the boycott, saying various times it was to achieve ""due process"" for their 10 teammates suspended over an alleged Sept. 
The Gophers football team has ended its boycott on all football activities, maintaining their spot in the Dec.

Former wrestling head coach J Robinson oversees a practice on September 18, 2012. 
Evidence suggests a University of Minnesota Athletics Department administrator and several staff members knew of at least one wrestler using and selling drugs as early as December 2015 — about three months before a University internal investigation said the department and wrestling coaches became aware of a drug problem on the team. 
Senior Associate Athletics Director Marc Ryan sent an email on Dec. 7, 2015 to former wrestling head coach J Robinson, current interim head coach Brandon Eggum, assistant coach Luke Becker and trainer Rich Schlotfeldt alerting them to an unspecified incident possibly requiring further investigation by a University athletics drug and alcohol committee, the University of Minnesota Police Department’s investigation file shows. The files were obtained by the Minnesota Daily through a data request. 
That same day, an email sent by Ryan suggested he “had known that the unlawful use, sale, or possession of drugs was a problem for at least one student,” according to an examination of electronic records completed on behalf of UMPD. The email referenced in the electronic records report was completely redacted by the University. 
And communications from that day reference ""'orange pills' possessed by one student,"" though the sender of those messages isn’t included in the heavily-redacted report. 
But Ryan told police he was ""first informed that there was suspected drug activity on the wrestling team"" in mid-March according to documents detailing the investigation into the sale and use of Xanax by University wrestlers. 
The University first learned of the problem in early April through an anonymous report, triggering a police investigation of the drug ring, according to the findings of a school investigation released the same day Robinson was fired. 
The University’s official report admits to staff-wide knowledge of the drug problem in March, but it doesn’t mention that evidence suggested Ryan and other staff knew months earlier. 
Coaching and athletic department staff purposely limited electronic communication, according to the examination of electronic records completed for UMPD. 
“Several messages indicate that coaching and athletic department staff wished to keep their electronic communication limited,” the electronic records report noted. 
Robinson’s University email account showed no activity throughout most of March. 
“The only way that there would be no activity in an email account is if the user deleted all of the emails,” University Information Services told police investigators. 
A University Athletics spokesman declined to comment for this story. 
Culture of troubling behavior 
Robinson was fired Sept. 7 after the University determined that he refused to cooperate with attempts to investigate his team’s drug problem to shield members from consequences for selling and distributing Xanax, a prescription anti-anxiety medication. 
Robinson had coached at the University for nearly 30 years, guiding the team to three national championships. 
The University disclosed letters of apology written by four of 14 accused wrestlers. The letters detail accounts of theft, gambling and fighting by team members. A team-wide drug test showed three members tested positive — one for marijuana and two for amphetamines. 
But the drug test — scheduled two days after the end of the wrestling season — did not test for Xanax. Wrestlers were informed after the test was administered that it would not check for the drug at the center of the criminal investigation. 
Though Robinson offered amnesty to wrestlers who self-reported to him, University attorney Brent Benrud said in a letter to Athletics Director Mark Coyle that it was unlikely the wrestlers met the self-reporting requirements of the Safe Harbor program, a voluntary disclosure process that protects students who admit to drug use from being tested. 
The Drug Testing Review Board determines whether athletes meet the Safe Harbor requirements, though the policy does not cover students involved in the sale of drugs. 
The anonymous University wrestler who tipped off the investigation said a teammate showed him video evidence of wrestlers receiving ""500-1000s"" of pills by mail from a former wrestler who transferred to Old Dominion University in Virginia. 
In February 2016, Old Dominion staff found him passed out in a study area with a firearm in his backpack. He is no longer a student at the school. 
A University Office of the General Counsel document showed that several team members turned in drugs to Robinson, including Xanax, marijuana, Adderall and oxycodone — to which Robinson said, “Holy shit, I did not think you had this much.” 
Wrestlers either declined or could not be reached for comment. 
Leaders of the drug ring accused of selling or taking drugs were first- or second-year wrestlers. All of the first- and second-year wrestlers lived in the 17th Avenue Residence Hall. 
Police led an investigation into hundreds of package receipts for mail sent to the residence hall. 
Four team members were named as the distributors of the drug. 
Every one of the 14 wrestlers named by the anonymous reporter as users or sellers of the drug are listed on the school’s 2016-17 wrestling roster.

","A Twin Cities man allegedly was caught with marijuana and over $70,000 during a traffic stop on Highway 169. 
A Nicollet County sheriff's deputy stopped Jeremiah Devon Saeger, 23, of Blaine, for not having a license plate Tuesday afternoon in St. Peter. The vehicle was searched because it smelled of marijuana and Saeger admitted he had a marijuana pipe, according to the criminal complaint. 
Authorities said they found a quart-size baggie with 116 grams of marijuana, multiple baggies with marijuana residue, a scale and other paraphernalia. 
In a small safe there reportedly was over $71,000. The cash included three counterfeit $100 bills. 
Saeger allegedly admitted he smokes marijuana daily but said he is not a dealer. 
He told authorities the money was given to him by a friend to pay for college. He said he didn't know this friend's name, the complaint said. 
Saeger was charged Thursday in Nicollet County Court with felony counts of drug sales and drug possession.

            Tip leads to large marijuana growing operation near Gibbon
        
","An anonymous tip led to the discovery of a large marijuana growing operation in rural Sibley County. 
Authorities reportedly found 157 marijuana plants, nearly 8 pounds of cultivated marijuana, and marijuana wax and edibles on a farmstead at 62428 220th St. north of Gibbon on Tuesday. 
Marc Alan Gauquie, 40, lives at the property and was charged Thursday in Sibley County District Court with felony drug sales. 
The Sibley County Sheriff's Office received an anonymous letter in the mail in June alleging Gauquie was growing marijuana. 
A sheriff's investigator subpoenaed records from the power company that services the property and found it was using significantly more electricity than neighboring farms, according to a search warrant application. 
A member of the State Patrol conducted aerial surveillance of the property Monday and observed what appeared to be marijuana growing in a wooded area of the property, the warrant alleges. 
When authorities, with a warrant, searched the property Tuesday, they allegedly found marijuana inside and outside the residence. 
Marijuana allegedly was found in the area identified by the trooper. There also was marijuana and marijuana growing equipment in every room of the residence, according to the criminal complaint. 
Authorities said they found a total of 7.8 pounds of raw marijuana, 157 marijuana plants, 13 grams of marijuana wax and 58 candy bars containing marijuana. 
Gauquie was jailed and was released on bail. 
It's not the first time Gauquie allegedly has been caught growing marijuana. He pleaded guilty to felony drug sales after more than 300 pot plants were seized from him in 2009 in Kandiyohi County.

","A Mankato drug dealer caught with 3 pounds of marijuana was sentenced to two months in jail and two months of house arrest. 
Lawrence Andrew Stutsman, 26, was convicted of felony drug sales Wednesday in Blue Earth County District Court. Additional drug charges were dismissed in a plea deal. 
Stutsman sold over a pound of marijuana to a police informant for $2,500 in October, according to the criminal complaint. Then a Minnesota State University student, Stutsman told the informant he was using the money to help pay for school. 
Authorities then searched Stutsman's apartment and found another 2 pounds of marijuana, 23 grams of ecstasy and a handgun. 
Stutsman was sentenced Wednesday to 60 days in jail followed by 60 days of home confinement and then five years of probation. The charge will be reduced to a misdemeanor if he completes the terms of the sentence.

            With medical cannabis, only high for hopefuls is cost
        
","Jason Bennett was hoping Minnesota's medical cannabis program could help his daughter, Ashlyn. She has Rett syndrome, a condition that causes seizures, but the family realized the program is unaffordable for them and many others. Photo by Pat Christman 
MaryAnn Nelson of Mankato kissed her daughter Rachael's hand during a House of Representatives committee meeting to review a bill for medical marijuana. Rachael suffers from Rett syndrome, a rare brain disorder that causes seizures. The Nelsons and other local families are now unable to afford the costly treatment, as insurance doesn't cover it. File photo from The Associated Press 
MANKATO — After all her work pushing for legalized medical cannabis in Minnesota, MaryAnn Nelson doesn’t even have her daughter enrolled in the program. 
A year ago the Mankato mother and her daughter, Rachael, became something like the faces of the local push for medical cannabis. They and other families of children with Rett syndrome, a condition causing daily seizures, hoped legalization would lead to much needed relief. 
The reason the Nelsons aren’t signed up isn’t because medical cannabis doesn’t work. It’s because they can’t afford it. And they’re not alone. 
Several area families of children with Rett syndrome haven’t been able to sign up due to exorbitant costs that insurance won’t cover. 
Nelson said her daughter’s treatment would cost $500 a month. As a single mother, that price is too steep. 
“My other children know that seizures are a part of life and I prefer that they didn’t know they were part of life,” she said. “There’s a medicine out there and I just wish we could afford it.” 
Like others in the area, Nelson said she experienced sticker shock once the medical cannabis program started. 
Jason Bennett, of Mankato, said his daughter, Ashlyn, tried the CBD, or cannabidoil meds, for a couple months last year. The cost doubled after one month once the dosage was increased, and the uncertainty of cost from month to month forced them to drop out. 
“I can’t even get to the point of seeing if it works because it’s cost prohibitive,” Bennett said. 
On top of the cost, the accessibility was a major issue for the Bennetts. They had to drive to LeafLine Labs in Eagan to fill out their prescriptions. 
Bennett said it’s frustrating to be able to fill out a prescription down the street for a range of other medications, but then have to drive more than an hour for another legal medication. To him, it further feeds into the stigma still attached to marijuana as a medicine. 
“It makes you feel like you’re doing something wrong, and at the end of the day I’m trying to make my daughter better,” he said. 
Concerns like these aren’t limited to the Mankato area. A recent survey from the Minnesota Department of Health found 73 percent of respondents reported the cost of medical cannabis to be unaffordable. 
Meanwhile, 90 percent of those surveyed reported “mild to significant” benefits paired with few side effects. 
Michelle Larson, director of the Minnesota Department of Health's office of medical cannabis, said she wasn’t surprised by the effectiveness of treatment or the costs. 
Medical cannabis, like many other prescription medications, is expensive when it has to be paid for out of pocket, she said. 
“We know that costs are prohibitive and we are concerned about it,” she said. 
Nelson said her insurance doesn't cover medical cannabis because of its status as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law. Despite medical cannabis being legal in half the states, federal law considers it to serve no medical purpose. 
Minnesota, like most states with medical marijuana, does not regulate the prices set by the companies who manufacture, market and distribute the medicine — LeafLine Labs and Minnesota Medical Solutions are the two manufacturers approved in the state. 
At least one state, New York, does regulate prices for its medical cannabis program. There, registered organizations submit costs to the state program. 
The commissioner then determines whether the prices are reasonable once the cost of production and profit is taken into account. Prices reported in New York, however, weren’t much cheaper than the prices cited by Nelson and Bennett. 
Dan Brinkhaus, a New Prague parent who founded the Minnesota Rett Syndrome Research Association, said it's discouraging to hear about costs when the effects of medical cannabis are so encouraging. 
“We’ve heard big success stories around medical marijuana,” he said. “(The cost) really is frustrating.” 
Just like Bennett and Nelson, Brinkhaus isn’t able to afford the treatment for his child. The parents still maintain hope that their loved ones will be able to experience the benefits, even if they know it might not be anytime soon. 
Nelson’s daughter did qualify for a trial in which she’d receive a year’s worth of treatment. The timeline keeps getting pushed back though, Nelson said. 
Bennett, meanwhile, said he’s looking to the legislature to take the necessary steps to help make sure the program is affordable. He and other local families are regularly in touch with Rep. Clark Johnson regarding their concerns. 
Although it’s not clear what can be done at this point to address accessibility and cost, Johnson said it’s certainly a big enough concern to explore further. 
“It’s something that’s important to a number of my constituents, and it needs that kind of energy through the rest of the state to have a serious discussion,” he said. 
After saying the program has had an encouraging start, he wondered if the Legislature was perhaps overly cautious in crafting the bill. 
Although it’s tough seeing his daughter have multiple seizures per day knowing medical cannabis could help, Bennett said all he can do for now is practice patience. 
“What’s happened has been a good step forward but there’s a long way to go,” he said. “I would say what I’d really like to see is have it be treated like any kind of medication.”

            Marijuana, meth still the top local drugs in '17
        
","Marijuana is still king among Mankato-area drug users, methamphetamine is still the most destructive, and the opioid epidemic plaguing other parts of America is still not a widespread problem locally, according to statistics from the Minnesota River Valley Drug Task Force. 
The task force — which covers Blue Earth, Nicollet, Watonwan and Martin counties — made 165 drug-related arrests in 2017, said task force Cmdr. Jeff Wersal. That's a 10 percent jump from the previous year, and the total number of cases handled rose a similar amount. 
""For the last five or six years, it's the most cases,"" Wersal said. 
The growth could indicate growing illegal drug use, but it could also reflect additional enforcement efforts by the task force, which added a fifth officer in 2017, he said. 
The numbers didn't show any major changes in drug preference such as skyrocketing use of heroin or opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and codeine that have devastated other regions of the United States. 
""I don't know why, because Rochester's got a problem, so does the metro and so does northern Minnesota,"" Wersal said. 
Among other work, the task force attempts to set up buys from drug dealers using undercover officers or cooperating informants. 
""Heroin is just tough to find,"" he said. 
Fewer than 4 grams of heroin (about one-seventh of an ounce) were seized or purchased in undercover drug buys by the task force in the four counties last year, which compares to 14,574 grams of marijuana and marijuana concentrates (32.1 pounds), 1,392 grams of methamphetamine (3.1 pounds), and 149 grams of cocaine (about a third of a pound). 
Opioids do show up in the area but almost exclusively as illegally obtained prescription pills and fentanyl patches. 
Roughly half of the 1,454 prescription pills obtained by the task force were opioids with most of the rest being the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and the ADHD-drug Adderall. The number of prescription pills seized or purchased rose by more than 50 percent last year. 
One reason heroin and related opioids haven't made major inroads in the Mankato area is that the large population of young adults aren't attracted to it. 
""It's really not a college student drug,"" Wersal said. ""They're more into the cocaine and party drugs (such as MDMA drugs commonly known as ecstasy and molly)."" 
The purchase and seizure of traditional marijuana (nearly 30 pounds) was up more than 57 percent, and the amount of marijuana concentrate — oil, wax and marijuana edibles — nearly doubled. Much of that, including popular THC-infused Gummy Bear knock-offs, came from Colorado and other states where the products are legal, he said. 
The amount of meth obtained was up 77 percent, and Wersal said that drug continues to be the most destructive in south-central Minnesota in undermining the health of users, disrupting families and prompting crime by addicts desperate for money for future meth purchases. 
""Just about every crime — burglary, robbery — you can link back to drug use and a large majority of the time it's meth,"" he said. 
Along with the seized drugs and the arrests, the task force removed 19 children from the homes of drug-abusing or drug-selling caregivers in 2017. Forty-four firearms were seized. 
The only drug the task force saw less of last year was cocaine, and that's because 2016's number was inflated by a single case in St. James where 2 pounds of cocaine was seized. 
Just four people were charged with manufacturing illegal drugs, all of it meth from two labs. That's three more arrests than the previous year but a fraction of what was seen two decades ago when most locally consumed meth was locally produced in makeshift labs. 
New regulations that made it harder to shoplift the cold medicines used as a raw ingredient for meth production are a major reason, and it now costs about as much to cook up a homemade batch of meth as to purchase imported meth, Wersal said. It's also much more risky because possession of a small amount of meth is a misdemeanor but manufacture of the same amount carries a 86-month prison sentence. 
""But a few of the old-school people still think they can do it,"" he said, saying the 2017 arrests all involved older meth users. 
Of the 165 drug arrests last year by the task force, 78 resulted in charges of first-, second- or third-degree charges for possession or sale of hard drugs or possession or sale of large amounts of any type of illegal drugs. There were also 75 charges for fifth-degree drug offenses, typically misdemeanors for possession of smaller amounts of drugs. 
The people facing fifth-degree charges weren't a target of the task force, Wersal said. Those charges often involved people on hand when a search warrant or investigation resulted in the arrest of a dealer. 
""He's usually got three or four friends there who have dope in their pockets,"" Wersal said. ""And they don't get a free ride.""

            Marijuana, bullets and stolen wallet allegedly found in North Mankato residence
        
","NORTH MANKATO â€” A felon is facing several new charges after a large amount of marijuana, bullets and a stolen wallet allegedly were found in his North Mankato residence. 
Police went to the Nicollet Avenue home of Adam Hans Sageng, 36, on Tuesday looking for a wanted man they suspected was staying there. 
They didn't find the man, but they found evidence of drug dealing and other crimes, according to a criminal complaint. 
Authorities allegedly found marijuana in several locations weighing a collective 24 ounces. They also allegedly found marijuana wax, pipes, scales and other paraphernalia, four cellphones and a box of shotgun shells, which Sageng is not permitted to possess because he has felony convictions. 
A wallet and gift cards that had been reported stolen from an employee's vehicle outside an area restaurant April 27 also allegedly were found. A co-worker of the victim told police a man came to the restaurant May 1 and tried to use a stolen gift certificate with the victim's name on it. A North Mankato police officer showed the co-worker a photograph of Sageng and the co-worker identified him as the man who brought in the gift certificate. 
Sageng was charged Thursday in Nicollet County District Court with felony and gross misdemeanor drug possession, felony possession of ammunition by a felon and misdemeanor possession of stolen property.

            Dramatic jump in deaths due to drugs, alcohol, and suicide among Americans leave experts searching for solutions
        
","The drug, alcohol, and suicide epidemics currently are responsible for 350 deaths per day, or 14 per hour, or one every four minutes, according to the report Pain in the Nation: The Drug, Alcohol and Suicide Epidemics and the Need for a National Resilience Strategy, released by the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) and Well Being Trust (WBT) earlier this year. Drug overdose deaths tripled from 2000 to 2015, alcohol-induced deaths increased 37 percent over that period, and suicide deaths jumped 28 percent in that duration. (File) 
OWATONNA — Despite public health efforts to educate Americans on the perils of substance abuse — as well as demystifying mental health in hopes of attenuating suicides — deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide continue to climb at staggering rates in the United States. 
The drug, alcohol, and suicide epidemics currently are responsible for 350 deaths per day — that’s 14 per hour, or one every four minutes — according to the report Pain in the Nation: The Drug, Alcohol and Suicide Epidemics and the Need for a National Resilience Strategy, released by the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) and Well Being Trust (WBT) earlier this year. Drug overdose deaths tripled from 2000 to 2015, alcohol-induced deaths increased 37 percent over that period, and suicide deaths jumped 28 percent in that duration. 
“It is discouraging,” said Amy Roggenbuck, public health director for Steele and Dodge counties. “Our biggest challenge in public health is finding the people who need services the most [...] and filling in the gaps.” 
At Public Health, “we do family home visits,” because “drugs and alcohol can be a cycle within families,” Roggenbuck said. So often, children who grow up in homes with drug or alcohol abuse “don’t know any different,” and “it’s their norm.” 
“We’re trying to break that cycle and teach them healthier habits,” she added. “We can be a support system for them.” 
Drugs, alcohol, and suicide could account for 1.6 million fatalities over the coming decade (2016 to 2025), according to the Pain in the Nation report. That would represent a 60 percent leap from the previous decade, as there were a million deaths from these causes from 2006 to 2015. 
Perhaps even more alarming, the study found that those estimates for the coming decade might actually be on the conservative side due to the exponential leap in use of drugs like heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil. If that trajectory continues, death rates would actually double, to 2 million, by 2025. 
“In almost every meeting I’ve been in over the past year, the opioid crisis comes up,” Roggenbuck said. 
Even the local area has seen recent deaths from fentanyl and carfentanil, in which victims unwittingly ingested it when it was mixed in with their usual drug of choice. 
All that said, while “opioids are getting most of the attention, alcohol is still our number one drug of choice,” she said. “It still tops all the others.” 
As of 2015, more than 43 million Americans experienced a mental health issue, more than 20 million had a substance use disorder, and more than 8 million experienced both. 
As high as those numbers are, they are almost assuredly conservative, due to the stigma around mental health and substance abuse, as well as a paucity of available treatment options, according to Pain in the Nation. Only about 10 percent of people with substance use issues receive the recommended treatments. 
In 2017, 60 percent of residents taken in by Safe Harbour — a community-based intensive residential treatment program under the South Central Human Relations Center umbrella — presented with dual diagnosis, i.e., mental health struggles and a substance abuse disorder, said Amy Bartz, treatment director for intensive residential services. Fortunately, in the past handful of years, more organizations have recognized the proliferation of dual diagnosis, leading to combining efforts, rather than “a silo of services.” 
Unfortunately, just as “there’s no one-size-fits-all treatment for people” battling addiction, there’s not “one root cause,” either, said Barb Durbahn, director of community programs for SCHRC. However, people do usually turn to drugs or alcohol to in hopes of attenuating some physical or emotional pain. 
While one can argue whether the world is any more stressful now than ever before, there is more of an emphasis on “quick relief” in American society, Bartz said. Rather than “leaning into pain” with the support of family and friends, individuals too often isolate themselves and reach for drugs or alcohol to ameliorate their problems. 
Despite social media’s inherent promise of uniting people, folks are as lonely as ever before, according to recent research. 
For example, in an online survey of more than 20,000 Americans conducted by Cigna earlier this year, 47 percent said they feel left out, 43 percent feel their relationships are not meaningful, 43 percent feel isolated from others, and one-in-five surveyed said they rarely or never feel close to people. The most-socially-isolated age group in the report was those 18-22, and young people with the highest rates of social media use felt no less lonely than individuals with very limited social media involvement. 
Suicide rates among teenagers continue to soar, up an incredible 70 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicides per 100,000 teens between the ages of 10 and 17 jumped from 2.97 in 2006 to 5.05 in 2016. 
Admissions for those ages 5-17 for suicidal thoughts and actions more than doubled from 2008-2015, according to a study of pediatric hospitals released in May of 2017. White males between the ages of 14 and 21 were the group at the highest risk of suicide. 
“I do think people are taking suicidal threats more seriously,” which may account for part of that uptick in hospital visits, Roggenbuck said. However, the number of individuals — especially young people — committing suicide or at least contemplating ending their lives is obviously disconcerting. 
“Just anecdotally, I think more bullying goes on — even though schools have addressed it well — because of social media, which makes it easier to cyber-bully,” Roggenbuck said. “You see it in the news all the time.” 
“I also feel there is more pressure on kids,” now, than even a decade ago, she added. “Kids deal with adult issues at a younger age.” 
Furthermore, drugs on the street have become both stronger and easier to procure in recent years, Durbahn said. “Those of us in the field are becoming aware of how easy it is to get addicted.” 
“These are people who didn’t plan to become addicted,” she added. “This was not their plan, but recreational use (shifted) to addiction pretty quickly, and then it is tough.” 
Drugs and alcohol, of course, can lead into suicidal behavior, Roggenbuck said. “People are self-medicating, but it’s not helping their depression, it’s making it worse.” 
More Americans actually die from suicide each year than from car accidents or opioids, according to the CDC. Suicide and “self-harm,” which includes suicide attempts, cost the nation $70 billion annually in medical care and lost work time. 
Public Health, of course, is “on the preventative side,” Roggenbuck said. “We’re upstream, trying to figure out the root causes.” 
On the issue of suicide, Crisis Response for Southeast Minnesota “has been a great resource,” and “they’re maybe underutilized,” she said. Anyone can call the 24/7 help line — because, naturally, people don’t tend to schedule their personal crises during regular business hours — at 844-274-7472, and staff will gather information, ensure safety, and connect callers with local resources. 
Additionally, as of April 1, Minnesota joined the national nonprofit Crisis Text Line, which is available every day of the year at any time. People who text “MN” to the number 741741 will be connected with a trained counselor. 
Furthermore, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and provides free, confidential support year-round for people in crisis. The service includes options for veterans and current military members. 
Preventing suicide is paramount, since so many individuals who live through attempted suicide are glad they failed, Bartz said. Of those she’s spoken to during screenings at Safe Harbour, “the vast majority are grateful they didn’t succeed (at suicide).” 
On a micro level, Steele County ranked 31st of 87 Minnesota counties in the health outcomes category in the latest edition of the Robert Wood Johnson and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute annual County Health Rankings. In the length of life category, Steele County ranked 25th. 
The Health Factors category examined everything from health behaviors (Steele County came in 29th) to physical environment (85th of 87 counties). In overall quality of life, Steele County ranked 47th in 2018. 
Steele County was once a stalwart at the top of the county health rankings, but has declined in recent years. In 2012, Steele County was the report’s healthiest county in Minnesota. 
Roggenbuck doesn’t put nearly as much stock in these rankings as she does in the community health survey residents of Steele County take every five years or the one given by Allina Health every three years. 
Despite the fall of Steele County in the County Health Rankings, “I don’t think we’ve gone down the drain,” she said. And, lest anyone think she’s just defending her county, Dodge County — also under her purview — finished fourth this year, and “I don’t take that very seriously, either.” 
She also closely examines data from the Minnesota Student Survey, which is “pretty telling,” she said. Since 90 percent of Americans with a substance abuse problem started smoking, drinking, or using other drugs before age 18, it’s instructive to see how many Steele County youth have already been introduced to those substances. 
In Steele County in 2016, 10 percent of eighth-graders reported drinking an alcoholic beverage at least once in the past month, while the state average among eighth graders was under 8 percent, according to the Steele County Safe and Drug Free Coalition. However, fewer Steele County high school freshmen and juniors were drinking than the state average in 2016, with 9 percent of local freshmen and 24 percent of local juniors reporting imbibing in a given month against 11 percent and 25 percent, respectively, for state averages. 
Fewer Steele County teens and adolescents were abusing prescription medications or using marijuana in a 30-day snapshot than the state average, according to the coalition. Only 7 percent of Steele County youth in grades 8, 9, and 11 were using marijuana — that number was 9 percent for the state average — and only 3 percent of Steele County students in those aforementioned grades reported abusing prescription drugs, contrasted with a state average of 5 percent. 
The Coalition is also working with the Statewide Health Improvement Partnership (SHIP) to reduce the availability of drugs and prescription opioids by enhancing access to safe storage and disposal methods; the goal is to increase the amount of those pills collected by 10 percent by next October, according to Mary Urch, Steele County Public Health nurse. Furthermore, a second prong of the strategy is to provide information to parents to prevent access to prescription drugs/opioids by their children, increase understanding of epidemic trends, and remind everyone of the risks involved. 
In order to stem the tide of deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide, “we need to get to kids early and don’t just tell them what to do, but show them how to be healthy in their daily lives,” Roggenbuck said. “We also need to make sure people know there is support out there, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached” to seeking help.

","The Independence Party of Minnesota has come out in favor of marijuana legalization, joining an emerging group of smaller political parties to do so. 
But the IP is the first major party in the state to take a definitive pro-legalization stance, another sign that social perceptions of the federally outlawed plant are changing. 
“I think eventually it’s going to be legalized in all 50 states cause there’s so much revenue that the state can pick up,” said Thomas Price, an IP-endorsed candidate for the state House of Representatives District 27A. 
That district includes Blooming Prairie and has a DFL incumbent in Rep. Shannon Savick. 
Price favors legalization of marijuana, as well as the expansion of medical programs. He pointed to high tax revenues in Colorado from legalized recreational use and said that current limitations create a “road block” between cannabis and the people who could potentially benefit from it. 
In legislative debates, some Minnesota lawmakers used the same Colorado policy as a cautionary slippery slope argument against medical programs. 
The IP has fielded candidates in multiple state and national races this year. They include Brandon Borgos, who is seeking the Attorney General spot. He sits on the board of Minnesota NORML, a marijuana legalization lobbying group. 
Hannah Nicollet, who is running on the IP ticket for governor, also has spoken in favor of legalization. 
To remain a major party in Minnesota, an IP candidate must receive at least 5 percent of the vote in a statewide race. Independence Party Chairman Mark Jenkins has said that the party is more than just its marijuana stance, and that taking sides on some issues was the right decision. 
Still, it is unclear if the pro-legalization position will overshadow other issues and whether voters will be attracted to or alienated by the party as a result. 
“I don’t see it as an issue that moves a lot of votes one way or another,” said Tim Penny, former U.S. Representative who also ran for governor in 2002 as an IP candidate. 
Penny now heads the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation in Owatonna. He said that he isn’t as active in the IP as he used to be, but said that there is a “core of party activists” in the region. 
He said that while the pro-legalization stance distinguishes the party from Democrats and Republicans, it may not be a net gain in support — in St. Paul or in Washington, D.C. Party leaders might be better off focusing on what he called more relevant issues like fiscal policy, government reform and campaign finance. 
In the end, he’s confident that at least one IP candidate will capture 5 percent of the statewide vote and retain major party status in Minnesota. 
Public views on marijuana have shifted over the past decade. Penny said he was surprised when he first heard of medical cannabis proposals during his gubernatorial run. This spring, Minnesota became the 22nd state to implement medical marijuana, though it is one of the strictest policies yet. 
Legalization models in Washington and Colorado are being closely watched by opponents and proponents alike, with the former worried about increased access. 
Darren Reed, project coordinator for the Steele County Safe and Drug-Free Coalition, said that whatever the legal status of a substance, the potential for abuse remains. He argued that loosening marijuana laws increases that risk. 
“It’s a scary thought for me, because I think any time we’re putting a drug into more people’s hands there is a danger to it,” Reed said. 
He believes that the changing social attitudes toward marijuana create a false sense of safety. And while he promotes moderation with a legal substance like alcohol, Reed doesn’t anticipate advocating safe use of marijuana over prohibition. 
In this election year, the marijuana movement is making a presence. In the races for Minnesota governor, auditor and attorney general, candidates have filed under pro-cannabis party affiliations such as Legal Marijuana Now and Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis. 
Early in Price’s campaign for state House, he said the issue hasn’t come to the forefront of discussion yet. But he feels he’s on the right side of a growing special interest. 
“Change is inevitable,” he said.

            Two charged with more than 30 pounds of pot
        
","It might be legal back home in Colorado, but the 30-plus pounds of marijuana and marijuana wax police reportedly found during a traffic stop Saturday has landed two men in hot water with Steele County prosecutors. 
Justin Mourray, 29, and Jesse Price II, 32, both of Colorado, were charged Monday with third-degree possession of more than 10 kilograms of marijuana, which carries a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years imprisonment or a $250,000 fine. 
According to the complaint, two Minnesota State Patrol troopers parked on Interstate 35 south of Owatonna spotted a car with an object dangling from its rear-view mirror at about 6 p.m. and initiated a traffic stop. The vehicle, which had partially obscured Colorado plates, was driven by Mourray, with Price in the passenger seat. 
The troopers reported a strong smell of marijuana, and a K-9 unit alerted to several points on the car. Both occupants initially declined to exit, and eventually stepped out and were placed in the back of a squad vehicle. Price reportedly told police they needed a warrant to search the vehicle, and continued locking the car with his key fob from the squad vehicle as troopers attempted to search it. 
In the car, the troopers reportedly found several dozen plastic bags and containers of marijuana, numerous mason jars containing marijuana wax, and marijuana debris and other paraphernalia scattered around the interior of the vehicle. 
By weight, police found 27 pounds of raw marijuana, and 7 pounds of marijuana wax. 
The complaint does not specify why the troopers were both parked at the same interstate crossover when the alleged drug couriers passed by. 
Court records show both men made initial court appearances Monday. Price was bail of $5,000 with conditions or $25,000 without and is set for another hearing March 30, while Mourray’s bail was set at $5,000 and $20,000 and no hearings are scheduled until a settlement conference in May.

            Final Owatonna man sentenced for synthetic marijuana sale
        
","An Owatonna man who admitted to possessing synthetic marijuana that he then sold to an undercover cop at an Owatonna tobacco shop told the judge during his sentencing hearing Monday that he was a “good guy.” 
Omar Ahmed Abdallah, 48, appeared in Steele County District Court Monday afternoon for sentencing on a charge of possessing and selling synthetic marijuana to an agent with the South Central Drug Task Force in March of 2013. Abdallah, who originally was charged with three felonies and a misdemeanor, faced up to 15 years in prison and a $100,000 fine for the most serious of the charges. 
He pleaded guilty to a single felony charge in June and will perform 580 hours of community service and pay $581 in combined fines and court fees. 
“I apologize for what I did,” Abdallah told Judge Joseph Bueltel through an interpreter. “I have been here 20 years and haven’t had any trouble. I never drink, I never smoke, and I’m a good guy. I am sorry.” 
It was his lack of any prior drug-related offenses that likely kept him from serving any time behind bars, said Assistant County Attorney Sasha Zekoff, who noted that pre-sentence investigation recommended community service for Abdallah. And, indeed, a search of Minnesota court records shows that the majority of Abdallah’s run-ins with the law have been for minor traffic violations. In 2008, he was charged with selling tobacco to a minor, a misdemeanor. 
It was a point that was not lost on Ben Cass, Abdallah’s attorney. 
“The long and short of it, Mr. Abdallah, in selling the products at the store, believed what he was selling was legal,” Cass told the judge. “...Mr. Omar Abdallah regrets what has happened ... He has no prior history of controlled substance offenses.” 
Judge Bueltel gave Abdallah two years to complete the community service. 
Abdallah’s arrest came following a nearly year-long investigation of a local tobacco business — what was then known as Jericho Tobacco. During the investigation, members of the drug task force found what they said was $150,000 worth of synthetic marijuana. 
Three men — Omar Abdallah, Khamis Abdallah and Wael Abdallah — were all charged in March 2013 with crimes related to the possession and sale of the synthetic drug. 
Khamis Abdallah, who was in court Monday to show support for his brother, pleaded guilty last November to possession of synthetic cannabinoid, a felony. Two other felony charges were dropped as a part of the plea agreement. 
He was sentenced to 90 days, though all but three days of his sentence were stayed for a year and he received credit for time served. He was put on unsupervised probation and ordered to pay $381 in fines and court fees. 
Wael Abdallah, the only one of the three men who was not charged with a felony in the case, pleaded guilty to a possession charge in March 2013, about a week after the charges were filed against the three men. Like Khamis Abdallah, he got credit for three days he served in jail, was placed on unsupervised probation for a year and ordered to pay $381 in fines and court fees. 
Jericho Tobacco has since changed ownership and its name.

            Two Minnesota men arrested on felony drug charges in Steele County
        
","Two Minnesota men were charged with felony drug possession on Friday after they allegedly transported marijuana from California to Minnesota in a rental car. 
Jason Ashley Kingsley, 34, of St. Paul and Todd Richard Libby, 38, of Osseo were both charged with third degree possession of a controlled substance, which requires suspects be in possession of at least 10 kilograms of marijuana. The crime carries a penalty of at least two years in jail, and as many as 30 years, along with a fine of $250,000. 
According to a Minnesota State Patrol criminal complaint, the Northwest Metro Drug Task Force was patrolling the Minnesota and Iowa border based on information from an informant that Libby was using a rental vehicle to transport large quantities of marijuana from California to Minnesota. The task force was working with local and state officers to enforce any traffic stop because members of the task force were in unmarked vehicles. 
At about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, an officer observed a red four-door sedan traveling north on Interstate 35. According to the complaint, one of the occupants in the vehicle matched Libby’s description and the vehicle had a California license plate. The vehicle was a Ford Taurus registered to Libby from Avis, according to the complaint. 
The officer observed the car was traveling at about 75 mph and was crossing over the fog line, according to the complaint. The state patrol had set up a staging area to execute a stop at the intersection of I-35 and Highway 30 near Ellendale. 
The state patrol trooper pulled the vehicle over near the northbound Straight River Rest Area. Upon making contact with the occupants of the vehicle, the trooper identified Kinglsey as the driver and Libby as the passenger, according to the complaint. Kinglsey was reportedly “extremely nervous and could not sit still.” 
According to the report, the trooper saw energy drinks, a single key in the ignition, multiple cell phones and little luggage in the rear seat. When the trooper went back to his squad car, he requested a canine unit to respond to the scene. 
The trooper returned to the vehicle and asked Kinglsey to get out of the car. Kingsley said he and Libby were traveling back from California, where they had been for two weeks on a business trip in Napa Valley for Libby’s wine store, according to the complaint. 
Before placing Kingsley in the back of his squad car, the trooper asked him where they had started driving from that day, to which Kingsley replied Grand Junction, Colo. 
The trooper then spoke to Libby, who said they had left from Denver. According to the complaint, Grand Junction and Denver are about 243 miles apart. The trooper asked Libby about the lack of luggage in the vehicle, and Libby said it was in the trunk. 
The canine unit arrived and immediately alerted the officers to the presence of drugs in the vehicle. Officer’s searched the trunk and found three suit cases and one duffel bag, according to the complaint. 
The duffel bag contained only clothing, but the suitcases contained a total of 17 bags that were vacuum-sealed. Inside the bags was a substance that tested positive as marijuana. The bags were 1.4 pounds each, containing 10.7 kilograms, or 23.58 pounds, of marijuana. 
The car was towed to Dean’s in Owatonna, where a more thorough search was conducted. During the search, authorities found $1,081 in cash, two iPhones and two Samsung flip phones. 
Both men have had previous drug conviction charges according to the complaint. On Friday, both men had their conditional bail set at $20,000 and were ordered to submit to testing if requested by a peace officer. They are next due in court on Dec. 13.

            Eye in the sky: police show new drone to city council
        
","Detective Joel Hunt, right, demonstrates some of the capability’s of the police department’s new unmanned drone before Tuesday’s City Council meeting. (William Morris/People’s Press) 
OWATONNA — City Council members were disappointed to learn they would not see a flight demonstration in the council chambers before Tuesday’s meeting. Detective Joel Hunt, however, held firm. 
“That would be against everything I learned in my FAA training,” he said. “That would be machismo.” 
Hunt is the police department point person on the new unmanned aerial drone system purchased by the city. And while he declined to fly it during Tuesday’s study session, he was still able to explain and demonstrate many of the new capabilities the drone brings to the police department, and to the city as a whole. 
The drone is a DJI Matrice 210, a heavy-duty drone designed with sophisticated public safety and engineering uses in mind. Between the drone, the batteries and controllers, and four different camera options, the city has spent almost $40,000 to get the project up and running, money Hunt said came largely from found property money or civil asset forfeitures. 
Several city departments in recent years have looked into drone technology, efforts that came together under the police department, Hunt said. 
“Engineering was also looking at purchasing a drone, they’re looking at a consumer grade drone, and once we started to look into different applications ... when you look at the amount of money you’re spending on a consumer-level drone, and then when you can use it, that’s the difference,” he said. 
Currently two officers, Hunt and Sgt. Jason Petterson, are trained to operate the drone. Hunt said the department is still working on its policies and standard operating procedures, but describes a wide range of possible uses for the drone, ranging from maintaining a perimeter around a building to searching for missing children to even autonomously following a suspect. 
“You can point your camera at a certain person and it will tab them, and then it’s going to lock onto that person and follow them, and depending on what different modes you have for obstacle avoidance, it’ll move around different things,” he said. 
Capt. Eric Rethemeier said drones in recent years have become much more affordable, giving smaller departments the chance to add aerial surveillance to their toolboxes. 
“I came from a police department [Cedar Rapids, Iowa,] that had an air wing,” he said. “Very useful, we used it all the time, really expensive. Quite often, the aerial wing we had responded faster than we could on the street, so we always had that air coverage.” 
The drone comes with certain restrictions, some laid down by the Federal Aviation Administration and some by federal court rulings. The drone has a theoretical range of 7 km, including up to 2.8 km above ground, but in practice must remain in line-of-sight to the operator. Department policy will forbid the drone to be weaponized. And operators must observe the same restrictions on searches and seizures as other forms of policing. 
“There are privacy concerns. I can’t just fly this over someone’s house with the [heat-sensing camera] and say, ‘Oh, there’s a lot of heat kicking out of this house, m. Maybe there’s a marijuana grow in there,’ unless I have a warrant for that,” Hunt said, adding that yards not visible from the street are usually safe from scrutiny. “With a drone, flying at 400 feet, I think it’s probably a grey area that courts haven’t exactly decided with new technology, but we’re always going to err on the side of caution unless it’s plain view that we can see.” 
The drone already has been deployed once, to help the Sheriff’s Office seek a juvenile suspect who had fled through woods and onto a thinly-frozen river. In the future, it will be available through mutual aid agreements to other local government agencies. 
And it’s not just the police who envision having a use for the drone. Hunt said the engineering, community development and parks department have all pitched in money for the project, and could put the drone to work on projects ranging from surveying pavement conditions on city streets to shooting promotional videos for city recreation activities to monitoring grass and structure fires. 
“You could probably pay a subcontractor a lot of money to do that, or we could do it ourselves,” Hunt said.

            Several charged after weekend brawl at the Blast
        
","An Owatonna man is charged with felony assault and threats after a melee involving baseball bats and a pellet gun broke out Saturday at an ice cream shop downtown. 
Police say at least half a dozen people, many juveniles, were involved in the incident Saturday at Blast Softserve on Rose Street, and Jarod Fuller, 18, was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault, terroristic threats, and misdemeanor obstruction and possession of drug paraphernalia. He could face between one and seven years imprisonment if convicted on the assault charge. 
Also facing misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges over the incident are 19-year-old Bryan Dupris and a 17-year-old male, police say. 
According to the complaint against Fuller, police were called Saturday to the fight in progress with a baseball bat, and spoke to several people found fleeing the scene. Several of the juveniles told officers that Fuller and the 17-year-old male were planning to fight, originally at Dartt’s Park, but then gathered at the ice cream shop instead, where Dupris and the teen instead began fighting. At some point, Fuller reportedly pulled out a realistic-looking handgun and Dupris a knife, and witnesses report hearing Fuller threatening others present. 
Several participants in the fight reportedly told police they’d been struck by a bottle or a baseball bat, with one bleeding from the head, and police found a possibly blood-stained bat on the scene. Dupris told police he saw Fuller bring the handgun to the fight, and that he took it from Fuller and threw it away after crossing the nearby bridge. 
An officer on patrol spotted Fuller on Sunday and arrested him, during which he reportedly struggled and yanked at the cuffs, scraping the officer, and also reportedly made statements such as “I kill cops.” Police found a butterfly knife in Fuller’s pocket, and in his backpack found a pipe with apparent marijuana residue, packaging and instructions for a BB air pistol and spare CO2 canisters, a stun gun and a notebook with statements about shooting and injuring unspecified people. 
Owatonna Police Capt. Jeff Mundale said investigators do not know what was the cause behind the fight, and said police have not located the handgun used, which they believe is a BB gun consistent with the evidence found on Fuller. 
Court records show Fuller has had several past brushes with the law as a juvenile, including one case where he was charged with shooting out a neighbor’s windows and firing at passing cars with another BB gun. In the newest case, court records show Fuller appeared in court Tuesday and was set bail of $10,000 with conditions or $20,000 without. His next hearing is set for April 12.

298,300,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/lifestyle/health/4425066-cbd-cannabis-wont-get-you-high-so-why-are-so-many-people-using-it,CBD is cannabis that won't get you high. So why are so many people using it?,"In a lowlit room at Joy's Spa in Washington, Dawn Franklin is smoothing a creamy white mask onto Jessica Osorio's face. The mask, she says, is infused with chamomile and sage and aloe vera, plus one ingredient that she still has to explain to her clients: CBD. 
An aesthetician, Franklin started working with an Oregon chemist last year to make CBD products for the skin, believing that a little of it swiped onto the face could help repair the ravages of age. 
But Franklin also takes CBD in gummy form, popping some in the morning and some at night. Like a magic pill, she says, it wipes away the sleeplessness and the stress and the nagging pain in her back that has left her with a slight limp, though she's only in her 30s. 
""It's crazy,"" she acknowledges. But she insists that CBD can do it all. ""It's just crazy, the different things that it has helped."" 
For Generation Anxious, affixed to its phones and stricken by news alerts, overworked and under-rested, the mysterious substance known as CBD is quickly becoming the new ""it"" drug. 
Devotees whisper about CBD as a soothing remedy for racing thoughts and aching extremities. CBD for those restless nights. Also, somehow, CBD for those listless mornings. 
Suddenly, you can find sugar-coated CBD gummies to gnaw on, and balms to rub onto pulse points. There's CBD for your dog (gluten-free and pumpkin-flavored!) and CBD for your aching feet. You can buy bottled CBD water in trendy, seasonally-driven fast-casual restaurants, and bags of CBD-laced coffee in shops on busy thoroughfares in Washington, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas and dozens of other cities. 
Back at Joy's, Osorio, the mask still plastered on her face, pipes up about her own experience with CBD, how it seemed to quiet the back spasms she has suffered since an accident years ago. 
Plus, is it just her imagination, or do her wrinkles seem to have faded? 
Have we mentioned CBD's relationship to the green gold mine that is the American marijuana industry? (Surprise.) 
Also known by its full name, cannabidiol (pronounced canna-bid-EYE-ol), CBD is just one of hundreds of compounds hiding within the cannabis plant. It's a distant cousin of THC, the stuff in pot that's notorious for getting you stoned and for inciting the wrath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. 
But while the term ""cannabidiol"" smacks of weed, ""CBD"" somehow sounds . . . tame. Like something you can name-drop around Mom, like turmeric and melatonin and charcoal and biotin or any of the other wonder-elixirs that have replaced Prozac in America's medicine cabinets. 
The dizzying rise of CBD is a story of timing as much as of branding. As more states deregulate marijuana, the Reefer Madness stigma that surrounded it for decades seems to have gone up in smoke. 
But here's why CBD appeals to some who would never smoke a joint after dinner: Take a few milligrams of CBD as, say, an oil slipped onto the tongue or a piece of candy, and it tastes unmistakably like cannabis, which is to say, slightly minty and herbacious, and just a little funky. But cannabidiol's effect is startlingly anti-climactic. It's weed without the high. 
And this may be why CBD is legal in many states, including several that don't allow legal recreational or medical marijuana. 
An organic chemist named Roger Adams isolated cannabidiol amid a wave of research into the medicinal promise of marijuana in the 1930s and '40s. He filed for a patent, and in the decades that followed, marijuana growers experimented with raising plants with high levels of CBD and almost no THC, hoping that a puff might trigger its own trippy bang. 
It didn't take long for them to realize that they were wrong. So, so wrong. 
""CBD became known as the hippie's disappointment,"" says Stuart W. Titus, the chief executive of Medical Marijuana Inc., a producer of several CBD oils and products that entered the market in 2012. 
Now, the hippie's disappointment is back, rebranded as the stressed-out modern office drudge's salvation. 
Gwyneth Paltrow's obsessively followed lifestyle site Goop, never one to miss a chance to gush about a wellness trend, recently published a guide to CBD cocktails. One of the many cushy lounges offering swag at Coachella next month is promising CBD oils, along with yoga and vegan food, for all its guests. A writer for the website the Cut wrote that a little CBD made her feel ""delightful."" 
""Some people do want the high, of course,"" Titus says. ""But others are looking for the health and wellness benefits."" 
Which, according to the charter members of the Cult of Cannabidiol, are many. Infinite, in fact. 
""I like to call it the super-nutrient, the super plant,"" says Spike Mendelsohn, the Washington-based former ""Top Chef"" contestant behind fast-casual restaurants including Good Stuff Eatery. More recently, he's a partner in the CBD-infused ""wellness drink"" Plnt Water, which comes in such flavors as turmeric and ginger, and matcha and mint and, for now, is available in a healthy-leaning fast-casual restaurant chain. 
""It's really mother's milk,"" he says. ""It's natural."" 
Naturally, not everyone is buying the hype. 
Last year, the FDA dinged a number of companies hawking CBD based on unsubstantiated claims - mainly that it could cure or reverse cancer. 
The agency hasn't evaluated all the claims around CBD, but some in the research field already have their doubts. 
""I think you're dealing with disease states where people are grasping for answers,"" says Timothy E. Welty, a professor of pharmacy at Drake University in Des Moines. ""So they're turning to this and saying, 'This is the answer.' "" 
Welty has been involved with CBD use in patients with epilepsy, and at least two reputable studies have shown it can relieve seizures. But as for the rest of it - the anxiety and sleep claims, all anecdotal - he's doubtful. ""They're not scientifically founded, in my mind,"" he says. 
So: Is CBD just this year's activated charcoal or functional mushroom? Harmless enough to pop without worry? 
""I would be very cautious,"" Welty says. With no oversight of the candies and waters and food products containing CBD, he says, ""you're not sure what you're really getting."" 
For true believers, though, it's worth venturing into the unknown if it means tossing out the aspirin and the painkillers and the anti-depressants. 
""For a long time now, there have been people approaching a lot of chefs about working with cannabis and edibles,"" Mendelsohn says. Weed seems like fun. ""But is it worth risking all the other work that I have? I'm in business with my family. I do a lot of work with kids. I do a lot of work with policy."" 
Drugs? Unwise. The wellness space? Whole different ballgame, he says. Plus, there's no question there's a market for CBD. ""People,"" he says, ""are already buying it.""

""I just think it's so sad why we can't set up a program that someone would find easier than (it is),"" said Pat Mullen of Duluth. ""They've got to find a way to inform people."" 
When Mullen's fiancee, the late Linnea Stephan, was fighting brain cancer, they sought a prescription for medical marijuana to counter the nausea caused by chemotherapy, he said. But they couldn't find any oncologist at either Essentia Health or St. Luke's Hospital in Duluth willing to certify her for that condition. 
Unable to find a certifying provider in Duluth, the couple turned to a Twin Cities clinic. 
""It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in Duluth, but that's part of the problem is how would I find out?"" Mullen asked. ""How would I know who it would even be?"" 
There's no provider directory on the website of the Minnesota Department of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis. The department ""cannot say"" what providers are in the registry, said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the cannabis office. 
That came as a surprise to the Health Department's boss when she was asked about it during a visit to Duluth last week. ""That's a new one on me, that we don't do that,"" said Jan Malcolm, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed as health commissioner in late January. 
Different hospitals, different approaches 
Patients may find more difficulty obtaining medical marijuana certification at certain hospitals. 
At St. Luke's, oncologists are the only practitioners who are on the registry, said Dr. Gary Peterson, the hospital's chief medical officer. That's not to say that an oncologist would necessarily agree to certify a particular patient. 
""I would think that each individual cancer patient ... would be evaluated individually as to the appropriateness of medical marijuana,"" he said. ""We wouldn't expect that to be the first-line treatment."" 
But the decision about whether to certify patients is left up to the practitioners, Peterson said. 
Essentia Health takes a more centralized approach. Dr. Jeffrey Lyon, an internist who is on the  medical cannabis committee at Essentia, said practitioners are asked to try ""evidence-supported treatments"" before considering medical marijuana as an option. If the clinician then wants to recommend medical marijuana, he or she first must refer the case to the committee, which then rules on whether the patient can be certified. 
An expedited process is allowed for terminally ill patients with ""intractable nausea,"" he said. 
Lyon has led the committee since the beginning of the year, and there hasn't been a single request during that time, he said. 
Arneson said he senses frustration from prospective patients in the Duluth area. 
""We get complaints about not being able to find (a practitioner) to certify a patient from all over the state, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""But we have received a number from the northeastern part of the state with specific complaints about organizations."" 
The cost 
Income may be a factor in holding down the number of participants from some parts of the state. 
""Most people can't afford this program,"" Arneson said. ""That's just the reality of it. So it depends a little bit on the distribution of income, I would say."" 
The average monthly cost for marijuana patients in Minnesota is $150, Dr. Adam Locketz said. 
Locketz is a practitioner for TimeWise Clinic, which operates in Duluth and Lake Elmo, Minn. He has certified close to 2,000 patients for medical marijuana, some referred from larger clinics. 
But there are other costs before the patient even gets to the marijuana distribution center, especially in the first year. Locketz said he charges $250 for the first visit to certify a patient, with declining rates after that. The state charges another $200 to place the patient on the registry, and then $50 every succeeding year. A patient must be recertified each year. 
The costs and the hurdles have created a problem for the state's medical marijuana program, Lyon said. 
""The state has created this system, and they're not seeing the number of people buying their product that they had hoped for,"" he said. 
Nonetheless, state data shows growth in the patient registry every month since the program started accepting patients in June 2015. The curve became steeper starting in August 2016, when intractable pain became a condition for which marijuana could be prescribed. 
As of March 31, 9,435 patients were enrolled and in active status in the registry, the Office of Medical Cannabis reported. That was up from 5,119 a year earlier. 
Nearly two out of three Minnesota patients who received medical marijuana are certified for intractable pain. 
Those patients may be able to break their dependence on opioids, Locketz said. 
""Daily I'm seeing patients back who, over a period of years, have been able to use this to come off of fentanyl patches or oxycodone,"" he said. 
But while data coming from states with legalized medical marijuana shows a trend toward lower opioid use, Lyon said there's still a lack of quality clinical research in the field. 
""Maybe medical marijuana will be a significant tool in decreasing opioid abuse,"" he said. ""We just don't know.""

300,302,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/community/people/4487425-there-are-no-seizures-heaven-northern-minnesota-girl-centerpiece-medical,"'There are no seizures in heaven': Northern Minnesota girl, a centerpiece in the medical marijuana debate, dies at 12","Amelia Weaver, the Hibbing girl whose fight with a rare form of epilepsy led her parents to the center of the campaign for medical marijuana in Minnesota, died Thursday, Aug. 16. She was 12. 
""Warrior Amelia, after a lifelong battle with Scn2a, passed away today,"" parents Josh and Angie Weaver posted on their ""Fighting for Amelia"" Facebook page. ""We did not take one single moment with our Amelia for granted. It was the greatest privilege of our (lives) to be Amelia's parents. There are no seizures in Heaven sweet girl."" 
After suffering from seizures in early childhood, Amelia was diagnosed at age 4 with Dravet syndrome Scn2a, a condition caused by a gene mutation that produces a particularly devastating form of epilepsy. She was one of only 150 children in the world known to have Scn2a. 
According to an article from early 2014, 7-year-old Amelia was experiencing between 20 and 30 seizures daily. She was unable to communicate verbally, and when she walked she did so aimlessly. 
Learning of success stories in other states for epileptic children treated with medical marijuana, the Weavers embraced the campaign to legalize the drug for medical purposes in Minnesota. They found a willing ally in then-state Rep. Carly Melin, DFL-Hibbing, who authored a legalization bill in the 2014 session. 
Amelia, with short brown hair and soulful brown eyes, put a public face on the effort, appearing alongside her mother at news conferences, rallies and meetings with legislators. After a vigorous campaign, the bill to allow treating epilepsy and other specific conditions with medical marijuana was passed and signed into law by Gov. Mark Dayton on May 29, 2014. 
Legalization didn't take effect until July 1 of the following year, and the Weavers experienced frustrating delays before it became available to their daughter. But LeafLine Labs, one of the state's two medical marijuana suppliers, eventually placed a distribution center in Hibbing. 
By the end of the first month, Angie Weaver reported Amelia had experience a seizure-free day. The next six months were the best since Amelia first had seizures, the Weavers reported later. At one point, she was seizure-free for 20 straight days. She would smile and make eye contact with little sister Penelope and her parents. 
A photo of Angie and Amelia Weaver was featured on the LeafLine Labs website, with a link to their story and more pictures. 
But Amelia was still a sick girl with a compromised immune system. She suffered setbacks and hospitalizations, including an anxious drive to the Mayo Clinic on Christmas Day 2015. 
She recovered slowly, but suffered additional setbacks and last Sunday was airlifted to the Mayo Clinic, her parents reported on Facebook. ""Sadly, Amelia is in very rough shape,"" they told friends and family last week. 
The Weavers said on Facebook that details for a celebration of Amelia's life will be announced within the next few days. 
Hibbing is 75 miles northwest of Duluth."
301,303,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/crime-and-courts/4410236-regional-drug-task-force-sees-rise-marijuana-heroin,"Regional drug task force sees rise in marijuana, heroin","Marijuana and methamphetamine continue to account for most of the drug-related arrests in Kandiyohi County. 
But heroin is starting to show up more often, and fentanyl recently was seized for the first time during an arrest, said agents of the CEE-VI Drug Task Force. 
""We had not seen fentanyl in our task force area until last year,"" said agent Robert Braness. 
Information on numbers and trends was shared in a recent report to the Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners. 
The task force, which has been active since 1990, coordinates multi-jurisdictional drug investigations in Chippewa, Kandiyohi, Meeker, Swift and Yellow Medicine counties. 
Its agents made 387 arrests last year. Marijuana accounted for the majority of drug seizures — 72 pounds with an estimated street value of $137,000. 
Ten pounds of methamphetamine and over 900 prescription pills also were seized during arrests carried out last year by the task force. 
Heroin seizures totaled 15 grams, an increase from the year before, Braness said. And in a first, an arrest last year led to the seizure of a gram of fentanyl, the potent narcotic behind a growing number of opioid-related overdoses and deaths in Minnesota. 
Although heroin has emerged as a significant problem in other areas of the state and the U.S., it has been slow to reach this region. 
""We have been somewhat sheltered,"" Braness said. 
But he noted this has begun to change. Over the last couple of years, ""we've been seeing it on a more frequent basis,"" he said. 
He and task force commander Ross Ardoff outlined some of the trends occurring in the five counties covered by the task force. 
Restrictions on sales of Sudafed, an over-the-counter cold remedy containing an ingredient that can be turned into crystal meth, have led to a decline in home manufacture of methamphetamine, Ardoff said. ""We don't see meth labs like we used to."" 
But the price of methamphetamine has dropped significantly in recent years, leading to larger amounts of meth being seized during execution of search warrants, he and Braness said. 
For example, a search warrant executed in New London last summer resulted in the seizure of two pounds of meth and a six-year prison sentence for a man convicted of first-degree drug possession. 
More needles are being found, an indication of deep addiction, Ardoff and Braness said. 
Polydrug use also is becoming more common — for example, a marijuana user might also be using prescription pills and/or meth. 
While the region has experienced a slight decline in meth activity, marijuana-related drug seizures have been on the rise. Concentrates such as butane honey oil, a homemade extract of THC, the main active ingredient in marijuana, are becoming more prevalent, Braness said. ""It's fairly new to our area but it is here and we're running into it on a monthly and weekly basis."" 
Drug dealing and use often hit families hard. Ardoff and Braness said 70 children — 39 in Kandiyohi County alone — were removed from their homes last year because of drug use by adults in the household. 
In an especially worrisome development, firearms increasingly have been turning up in conjunction with drug seizures and arrests. Property forfeitures stemming from drug-related investigations last year by the task force included 51 guns, Ardoff and Braness said. 
In one case, a grenade was found along with numerous firearms, Ardoff said. 
And in a high-profile case earlier this year, nearly four dozen handguns, rifles, shotguns and submachine guns, along with homemade silencers, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and suspected explosives, were found during the execution of a drug-related search warrant in rural Willmar.

302,304,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/nation/4475592-does-legal-weed-make-police-more-effective,Does legal weed make police more effective?,"Marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington state has ""produced some demonstrable and persistent benefit"" to police departments' ability to solve other types of crime, according to researchers at Washington State University. 
""Our models show no negative effects of legalization and, instead, indicate that crime clearance rates for at least some types of crime are increasing faster in states that legalized than in those that did not,"" the authors write in a study published in the journal Police Quarterly. 
A crime is typically considered ""cleared"" if authorities have identified and arrested a suspect and referred him to the judicial system for prosecution. The Washington State study examined clearance rates for crimes in Colorado and Washington from 2010 through 2015, using monthly FBI data. 
To isolate the effects of legalization, the researchers looked at how the trends in clearance changed after the implementation of marijuana legalization in November 2012 in Colorado and December 2012 for Washington. While recreational markets in these states didn't open until 2014, provisions allowing for personal possession and use took effect shortly after the votes were certified. 
Clearance rates were falling in both states before legalization. Afterward the decline stabilized in Colorado and began to reverse itself in Washington. The authors note that no similar shift happened in the country as a whole. 
The researchers stress, however, that the data can't prove conclusively that legalization directly caused the changes in clearance rates. There could have been other changes to policing in those states during that time period, such as increased use of overtime hours, the implementation of new policing strategies or a more aggressive focus on certain types of crime. 
They note, however, that no other major changes to public policy happened in those states that would affect clearance rates in the way they observed. ""We think the argument that legalization did in fact produce a measurable impact on clearance rates is plausible,"" they conclude. 
Property crime clearance rates show a dramatic reversal in Colorado, with a brief boost in Washington followed by a continuation of the prior trend. 
The authors also looked at trends for some specific types of crime, most notably burglary and motor vehicle theft. ""The clearance rate for these two offenses increased dramatically postlegalization,"" the authors found. ""In contrast, national trends remained essentially flat."" 
Going beyond simple visual comparisons, the authors ran a number of statistical tests that largely confirm the findings hinted at in the charts: ""While there were both immediate and longer term differences between states which legalized and the rest of the country in terms of crime clearance rates, the long-term differences are much more pronounced, especially in Colorado."" 
Advocates for legalization have frequently argued that freeing police from the burden of low-level marijuana enforcement would allow them to devote resources to more serious crimes. The Washington State researchers say their findings support this idea: ""Our results suggest that, just as marijuana legalization proponents argued, the legalization of marijuana influenced police outcomes, which in the context of this article is modeled as improvements in clearance rates."" 
They note, furthermore, that ""there were no crime types in either state for which legalization appeared to have a negative impact on clearance rates.""

304,306,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/4408850-legalization-growing-elsewhere-marijuana-makes-half-nd-drug-arrests,"With legalization growing elsewhere, marijuana makes up half of N.D. drug arrests","The legalization of marijuana, or at least the attempt to do so, has gained steam. 
But recreational use still is illegal in most states and federally, meaning those who are caught with marijuana without a prescription can face criminal charges. 
In North Dakota, more than 50 percent of the drug arrests have involved marijuana for several years, according to the Attorney General's Office. Arrests have been on the rise in the state, and it appears large busts are becoming more common. 
A large concern is people may not realize recreation use of marijuana isn't legal in North Dakota, Grand Forks Police Deputy Chief Jim Remer said. The U.S. is made up of what he called a ""patchwork"" of marijuana laws—some completely outlaw marijuana use, many have legalized medical marijuana and a handful allow recreational use. 
""We don't have those laws in place that make it legal in other states,"" he said of recreational use. ""I think at times people can get very frustrated over that because they maybe don't understand that or think, 'It's legal there. It should be something that is OK here.' That's just not the case."" 
A group of North Dakotans hope to change that as they gather signatures to put a legalization measure on the November election ballot. The measure would fully legalize marijuana in North Dakota and would require the state to expunge any marijuana convictions from anyone's record who has been convicted in the state. 
Proponents argue North Dakota is ready for recreational use, and decriminalizing it would free up law enforcement officers to focus resources on other criminal activity, said Josh Dryer, campaign manager for the group behind the measure, Legalize ND. 
""The main thing is there is a market for marijuana in the state,"" he said. ""We either are going to get it from the cartels, we are going to get it from the other states that have legalized it—all of that trafficking would come down if it were legal within (North Dakota). 
But until that happens, law enforcement officers plan to enforce the laws as they stand, and people should be aware of each state's laws before using, Remer said. 
""Obviously, we don't make the laws. We just enforce them,"" he said. ""Whatever those laws may be, we'll be making sure we are enforcing those appropriately."" 
Large busts 
Eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational use of marijuana, while Vermont and Canada have approved laws that would see users lighting up possibly in July. More than half the states, including Minnesota and North Dakota, have approved legislation to allow the use of medical marijuana to some extent. 
Several large marijuana busts have made headlines in North Dakota. The Stutsman County Sheriff's Office seized 476 pounds of pot last month near Jamestown and another 200 pounds in December. Authorities found another 286 pounds of weed in November in West Fargo. In Bismarck, a 71-year-old man was arrested on charges of hauling 183 pounds of marijuana through the state. 
Closer to home, two UND students were charged with possessing marijuana with intent to deliver after officers found 60 pounds of pot, large amounts of cash and a rifle in November at their home at 1611 Fourth Ave. N. Mark Charles Hildahl, 20, pleaded guilty Feb. 5 in Grand Forks District Court to the Class B felony and was sentenced to 130 hours of community service. Cade Matthew Hoben, 21, has a court hearing March 15 in relation to the bust. 
The larger amounts of marijuana seized by the North Dakota Highway Patrol appear to originate from outside North Dakota and are destined for other states, Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Roark wrote in an email. 
""North Dakota Highway Patrol troopers do a great job enhancing the public's safety across the state,"" he said. ""Troopers take their responsibility very seriously and work hard to protect and serve the citizens of North Dakota."" 
Rising numbers 
Arrests related to marijuana in North Dakota have increased every year since 2009 from 1,533 to 3,362 arrests in 2016, according to Attorney General's Office data. 
The State Highway Patrol has followed the same upward trend for the most part. It reported 852 marijuana arrests in 2012 compared to 1,382 marijuana arrests last year, or an increase of 62 percent in five years, Roark said. 
The only decline in the last six years was from 2015 to 2016, when the state agency made 1,339 and 1,338 arrests, respectively. 
The Highway Patrol meets with other state patrol agencies in the U.S. each year to ""discuss best practices"" when it comes to marijuana enforcement, he said. 
""We will be reaching out to those agencies where recreational use has been legalized to determine the amount of increased workload law enforcement faced with the change,"" he said. 
The Grand Forks Police Department typically doesn't separate marijuana arrests when compiling total numbers for controlled substances, but it does track the number of ""green leafy substance"" confiscations each year. Those numbers have been on the rise almost every year too, from 139 items in 2012 to 269 confiscations in 2017, Lt. Brett Johnson said. 
The steady increase could be due to various reasons, Remer said. His department gets reports of marijuana use throughout the community, and officers use their own discretion in making arrests, he said. Those arrests would go away if North Dakota legalized recreational marijuana, he acknowledged. 
""It would be a change, obviously, but we would handle that change as we have to,"" he said. 
What wouldn't change is enforcement at U.S. international borders. Selling, possessing, producing and distributing marijuana still is illegal by federal law, Border Patrol Agent Jesse Lindemer wrote in an email to the Herald. 
""Consequently, crossing the border with marijuana is prohibited and could potentially result in fines, apprehension or both,"" the Grand Forks Sector spokesman said. 
Canadians could have legal access to recreational marijuana as soon as July, but travelers wouldn't be allowed to bring it into the U.S. 
""U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the laws of the United States,"" Lindemer said. ""Further, CBP is responsible for determining the admissibility of individuals based on the requirements of U.S. immigration law, which may include inquiries regarding the individual's past conduct."" 
The Border Patrol's Grand Forks Sector tends to have a limited number of marijuana confiscations by pounds. According to annual sector profiles, the Grand Forks Sector confiscated a pound in fiscal year 2015 and 9 pounds in fiscal year 2014. The other fiscal years from 2012 to 2017 yield zero pounds, according to Border Patrol data.

305,307,MN,www.wctrib.com,http://www.wctrib.com/news/government-and-politics/4462698-legal-pot-gets-green-light-after-canadian-senators-sign,Legal pot gets green light after Canadian senators sign off,"Canada's Senate on Tuesday passed the federal government's historic bill legalizing the recreational use of marijuana, clearing the way for the country to become the first advanced industrialized nation to legalize the drug nationwide and fulfilling a major campaign promise of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 
The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 52 to 29, with two abstentions, lifting a prohibition on the recreational use of marijuana that has been in place since 1923. The law will not take effect until it receives royal assent - a final ceremonial stage of the legislative process - and the government sets a date for legalization. 
On Wednesday, Trudeau announced that marijuana would be legal on Oct. 17. He had hoped to make cannabis legal by July 1, but Canada's provinces and territories said they needed eight to 12 weeks to make final preparations before they would be able to sell cannabis to consumers. 
Trudeau heralded the vote in a tweet, saying, ""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that."" 
Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who sponsored the legislation, tweeted that the Senate vote was a ""historic milestone for progressive policy in Canada."" 
The law makes Canada the second country after Uruguay to have a nationwide, legal market for marijuana. 
It grants the federal government the power to license and regulate a restricted group of cannabis growers but gives Canada's 10 provinces and three territories the discretion to decide how to sell and distribute the drug. Some, like Ontario, will sell it at a small number of state-run stores operated by the provincial alcohol monopoly. Others, like Newfoundland and Labrador, will sell it to consumers at select grocery stores. 
The legislation sets the minimum age for purchase at 18 and allows for the personal possession of up to 30 grams for dried cannabis, with rules on edibles to come later. Those caught selling marijuana to a minor could face stiff penalties of up to 14 years in jail. 
Like tobacco, producers trying to market their product face strict advertising rules. Cannabis can only be sold in plain packaging that is a single, uniform color and free of flashy graphics or images. 
Canadians spent more than 5.7 billion Canadian dollars on marijuana in 2017, with the majority of it for recreational use, according to a Statistics Canada report released in January. That makes cannabis a multibillion-dollar industry that is larger than the tobacco industry and as large as the beer industry. 
Bill Morneau, Canada's finance minister, said that he expects the government to rake in nearly 300 million Canadian dollars from the taxes on legalized cannabis. The provincial and federal governments will split the excise tax revenue 75-25 for the first two years after legalization. 
One of Trudeau's first major policy pledges as leader of the Liberal Party was to legalize marijuana, a promise that became a central pillar of his party's 2015 federal election campaign. When his government introduced Bill C-45 in April 2017, its backers framed it as an effort to discourage consumption among youth, while also crushing the illegal market. 
In a news conference after the legislation was introduced, Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief who was an architect of the legislation, said, ""Criminal prohibition has failed to protect our kids and our communities."" 
And while public opinion polls show Canadians have widely supported legalization, introducing the legislation was the easy part for Trudeau's government. The bill has been the subject of more than a year of fractious debate and games of legislative ping-pong between the Senate and lawmakers in Canada's lower house of Parliament. 
Conflict between the two groups flared last week when lawmakers rejected 13 amendments that the Senate added to the bill, including a contentious one over whether provinces could ban home cultivation. The Senate eventually deferred to the government's position of allowing Canadians to grow up to four marijuana plants in their home. 
Even after Tuesday's vote, the government is left with a long to-do list. A second piece of legislation that would change impaired driving laws and give police new powers to carry out roadside intoxication tests has not yet been passed. Questions remain, too, over whether to grant amnesty for past marijuana convictions and over how strictly police forces should crack down on growing cannabis at home. 
The legalization of marijuana in Canada has implications for cross-border relations with the United States. Under the law, it will remain illegal for Canadians to take cannabis across the border into the United States, just as it will remain a criminal offense for Americans to bring cannabis into Canada. 
Leonard Saunders, an American immigration lawyer in Washington state, testified before a Senate committee that Canadians could be denied entry to the United States even after cannabis is legalized because it is still considered illegal at the federal level in the United States. 
""I see a wall on the northern border,"" he said, adding that Canadians could face more scrutiny at the border if they admit to having smoked cannabis. 
But Ralph Goodale, Canada's public safety minister, told the Senate that his message to Americans is that ""this should not be an issue."" 
""It becomes an issue if you make it one, but there's no need to make it one because the border rules have not changed,"" he said.

            Struggle with marijuana edibles law continues for Wyoming Legislature
        
","A marijuana-infused gummy candy sits on a sales counter Feb. 24, 2016, at Organic Alternatives in Fort Collins, Colorado. Blaine McCartney/Wyoming Tribune Eagle 
CHEYENNE – Reforming Wyoming’s marijuana laws to clarify how punishments should be dealt out for possessing edibles remains largely at an impasse for state lawmakers. 
Following failed attempts at doing so in the last two consecutive sessions, the Wyoming Legislature is looking to take another attempt at more clearly codifying its laws pertaining to marijuana edibles. The task of developing a bill palatable to lawmakers is in the hands of the Joint Judiciary Committee during the Legislature’s interim months. 
On Tuesday, the committee met in Sheridan to address the matter for the second time this year since a failed House bill died at the 11th hour of the 2017 session. 
Rep. Charles Pelkey, D-Laramie, said he’s frustrated with the lack of progress on the matter. He said he is questioning whether it’s worth the Legislature’s time debating again in 2018. 
“We’ve been discussing this for three years and haven’t gotten anywhere,” Pelkey said. “It’s demonstrative of the futility of trying to regulate something that’s quite legal in some states and totally illegal in others. It’s frustrating to the committee, it’s frustrating to those who want harsher punishments, and it’s frustrating for those of us who want lesser punishments. I don’t see any prospect for change to the law.” 
A complicated array of considerations has inhibited reforming laws for several reasons. For one, punishment for marijuana possession is in-part determined by weight. When it comes to edibles, it can be hard to determine how much of marijuana’s intoxicating agent, THC, is present in products such as brownies. While a marijuana-infused brownie might weigh 3 ounces or more – enough to constitute felony possession in plant form – some lawmakers are concerned about dealing out felonies for a product with an undetermined THC amount in it. Current state statute stipulates that all cutting agents, including products such as butter or flour used in baking, count toward the drug’s weight. 
But some edibles might include a high amount of THC. Other concentrate products, such as hash oil, inherently have high THC amounts. Many lawmakers think those factors should constitute a felony in certain cases. Furthermore, some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the forms some edibles come in, such as gummies, make them particularly dangerous because they could appeal to young children. 
Crime lab testing for THC concentration in edibles remains a challenge for Wyoming law enforcement and courts when dealing out punishments for the products. The confusion has led courts to tossing out felony edible possession cases. Now, lawmakers are struggling to find where to find common ground that addresses the concerns on all sides. 
House committee chairman Rep. Dan Kirkbride, R-Chugwater, said he’s not sure any progress can be made on figuring out fair punishments until technology changes that. 
“We’re almost at an impasse until the measurement technology evolves to the point where there’s accurate testing available in a widespread manner,” he said. “Until that time, there are going to be those concerned about individual rights that won’t pass a bill that would land someone in jail unfairly.” 
A draft bill debated by the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday again called for making possession of 8 ounces a felony, but an amendment was passed that took the amount back down to 3 ounces. 
Pelkey said it seemed like the same push-and-pull he’s seen in the past. 
“To quote the great (New York Yankees catcher) Yogi Berra: ‘It seems like déjà vu all over again,’” he said. 
But Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, said she’s more optimistic about the possibility of passing a bill in 2018. She said she thinks it’s imperative the Legislature answer the calls of courts and law enforcement to fill a void in the state’s laws as soon as possible. While she acknowledged it’s a daunting task, Nethercott said she thinks the committee could put forth a passable bill. Where it goes from there, however, would be up to her fellow lawmakers. 
“We are hearing the concerns from the criminal justice community, law enforcement and courts, so we are committed to bringing forth a bill for the Legislature to continue to consider,” she said. “How it gets amended and its ultimate success is anyone’s guess. ... I don’t think it’s at an impasse at all. I think there are a lot of big questions that need to be answered and a lot of big policy decisions that need to be made, but I think we’re close. The fact the committee has worked on this for years is actually helpful.” 
The committee is expected to vote on a bill during its November meeting. Kirkbride said he thinks it’s likely whatever is put forward would run into the same complicating matters once it reaches the Legislature. However, he said a bill is still probably coming for lawmakers to consider in 2018. 
“It will keep coming up – I almost think something’s likely to come up every session,” he said. “But our chances of succeeding, I don’t know if they’re real strong.”

CHEYENNE – Wyoming senators passed their marijuana reform bill Wednesday, which follows the House of Representatives killing its version of the bill in the Legislature’s first week. 
The Joint Judiciary Committee passed two bills during the interim, one for each chamber, attempting to reform marijuana laws to address several concerns put forth by law enforcement and courts. Wyoming lawmakers have tried and failed to address issues that have come up since Colorado began loosening laws on the drug in the last several legislative sessions. 
Products infused with cannabis, such as edibles and liquids, continue to vex policymakers in terms of what amounts constitute felonies. 
Sarah Barrett of the Wyoming State Crime Lab reported to lawmakers in November that no new advances have been made since the last session that might make it easier to discern the drug’s concentration in any particular product. This has led to some hesitancy on the part of lawmakers worried they would be voting for laws that could apply felony charges for relatively minor offenses. 
Currently, Wyoming law states possession of 3 ounces or more of marijuana in plant form is considered a felony in Wyoming. The bill would make it a felony to possess more than 36 ounces of a cannabis-infused liquid, more than 3 grams of cannabis concentrate products or more than 3 ounces of marijuana in another form. 
On Wednesday, Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, proposed an amendment that would allow defendants to contend that a product they are charged with possessing doesn’t constitute a felony based on the amount of intoxicating elements in a product, such as an edible, at their own expense. 
Sen. Leland Christensen, R-Alta, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he was against the amendment because he heard in testimony the testing wasn’t accurate enough to meet a legal standard. But Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, supported the amendment, arguing the testing is commonplace. It just hasn’t made its way into an affordable marketplace that would allow Wyoming law enforcement agencies to conduct regular testing, Rothfuss said. 
“The idea that we can’t do this when, for example, we can tell the concentration of certain gases on a star 100 million light years away – it’s absurd,” he said. 
But it wasn’t enough to convince senators to amend the bill, as it failed 13-17. The bill passed its third and final reading in the Senate 19-11. Laramie County Sens. Fred Emerich and Anthony Bouchard, both Republicans, voted “nay.” 
While the House apparently lacked the appetite to consider its own measure, it will now be up to that chamber to decide whether to pass Senate File 23. 
A bill that would codify penalties for non-plant forms of marijuana passed the Senate on Wednesday. It now moves to the House of Representatives, where lawmakers voted overwhelmingly not to introduce their own version of the bill earlier this session.

            Drake: Medical marijuana will improve quality of life
        
","It’s not legal to toke up in Wyoming yet, but the day is coming sooner than many might think. 
When it does, residents of the Equality State won’t suddenly develop “reefer madness” despite the fears of some conservatives. In the case of medical marijuana, the quality of life for people who suffer from a variety of diseases or other debilitating medical conditions will greatly improve. 
How do I know this? Because that’s what has happened in the 23 states that already have approved medical marijuana. Almost 40 percent of Americans live in jurisdictions with compassionate medical marijuana laws. Why isn’t Wyoming one of them? 
When recreational use of marijuana becomes as common as buying alcohol and cigarettes, studies point to some positive changes for adults that don’t occur with those legal substances. I’ll get to those shortly. 
The war on marijuana, which always has been a costly failure, 
is over. The federal Justice Department no longer considers busting pot smokers as a priority. The effect of improperly classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug like heroin has resulted in full prisons, ruined young lives and prosperous drug cartels. 
It’s also helped some politicians score points with voters by peddling such phony claims as marijuana being a “gateway” to harmful drugs. Their claims are propaganda, not facts, and they don’t make us safer or healthier. 
Times are changing in Wyoming. The war on marijuana here is being fought on two fronts: by some lawmakers who are ahead of many of their colleagues, and by citizens who are uniting to change the laws themselves 
Polls have been consistent in recent years, showing about 72 percent support medical marijuana. Even in this conservative state, lawmakers who refuse to do what three-fourths of the public demands eventually will find themselves out of office. The only question is how long it will take. 
Rep. James Byrd, D-Cheyenne, is bringing back his proposal to lower the state’s penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana. House Bill 3 would make having less than half an ounce subject to a civil fine of $50. The penalty would be more appropriately the equivalent of a speeding ticket. 
Will HB 3 pass this year? No. Last year the Wyoming House voted 38-22 against a similar bill. And during the month-long budget session beginning Feb. 8, a measure will need two-thirds support just to be introduced. To reach that level would require 18 opponents to change their minds, and that’s not remotely possible. 
But it will provide another chance to show the people why it is in the state’s best interest to decriminalize marijuana possession. Mr. Byrd’s fines won’t be a huge moneymaker for any locality, but the shift would keep people from needless felony records and jail time and ruined employment and educational prospects. 
Mr. Byrd is also sponsoring HB 7, a companion bill that would allow people from other states with prescriptions for medical marijuana to legally possess the substance in Wyoming. With medical marijuana legal in neighboring Colorado and Montana, it makes sense to allow tourists to come into the state without the fear of being arrested. 
In the meantime, supporters of medical marijuana are waging their own campaign to get the issue on the election ballot. They are already off to a good start. 
The Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has collected 10,000 signatures on its petition in only five months. A total of 25,673 signatures must be garnered in the next 13 months, which shouldn’t be hard to obtain at the rate the group is going. 
This grassroots campaign should gain momentum as it literally heats up during the summer and more people are outside available to be approached. 
NORML Wyoming spokeswoman Carrie Satterwhite said the group has the fewest number of volunteer petition circulators in the conservative northeast part of the state, but that region will be targeted in the upcoming months. 
Ms. Satterwhite said Wyoming NORML is encouraging people to write letters to the editor in support of HB 3. Like many state residents, she believes decriminalization is necessary. 
“Why are we going after kids with two grams of marijuana when we have a terrible heroin and meth problem that’s out of control?” she asked. 
Ms. Satterwhite noted a recent documentary showed how the use of marijuana is actually helping heroin and meth addicts clean up in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 
“The drug cartels are losing money, so they’re shipping heroin that is purer than they had been before to get kids hooked on hard drugs,” she said. “It’s really sad. Fourteen hundred kids have died of heroin overdoses. There have also been many suicides.” 
The NORML spokeswoman noted that in 2015 the Legislature passed a bill that legalized the possession of cannabidiol. But people can’t get it because it can’t be manufactured in the state. 
Cannabidiol oil, or CBD, does not contain THC, the active ingredient in cannabis that gets users high. Scientists discovered it can be used to treat people with epileptic seizures. It may also have antipsychotic effects. 
“There are hundreds of people literally crying that I’ve run into while circulating these petitions,” Ms. Satterwhite said. “They’re saying, ‘Just tell us where to get the CBD.’ But I can’t help them because I don’t know where they can get it either. ... Legislators threw us a bone, but you can’t produce any CBD in Wyoming and you can’t take it across state lines without breaking federal law.” 
Business Insider points to 23 health benefits of using medical marijuana, including treatment of glaucoma, reducing some of the pain and nausea from chemotherapy and stimulating the appetite of cancer patients. 
Pot also has been shown to decrease anxiety, slow the progression of Alzheimer’ disease and ease the pain of multiple sclerosis. 
Medical marijuana lessens side effects from treating hepatitis C and increases treatment effectiveness, helps reverse the carcinogenic effects of tobacco and improve lung health, treats inflammatory bowel diseases and soothes tremors for people with Parkinson’s disease. 
It also helps veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, protects the brain after a stroke and relieves arthritis discomfort. 
If any other drug provided even a fraction of the benefits that medical marijuana does, it would already be legal in Wyoming and the other 26 states where it is now banned. 
Several generations of Americans have been taught to equate using weed with encouraging the use of harder drugs and ignore the myriad medical benefits. 
It’s difficult to undo the decades of fear related to using marijuana, and some people will continue refusing to make marijuana legal despite the fact it has scientifically been proven to be a beneficial medical resource. 
Eventually, Wyoming will embrace the medical marijuana laws that are now helping reduce the symptoms of thousands of sick people in other states. 
Reason and compassion will prevail, but it will take more time for lawmakers to see the light and do what’s right to help constituents who needlessly suffer. 
The Drake’s Take is a weekly column by veteran Wyoming journalist Kerry Drake, and produced by WyoFile.com, a nonprofit news organization focused on Wyoming people, places and policy.

GILLETTE — When Ali Kistler was pulled over for not having her taillights on a Saturday night in September, she knew she would be arrested. 
As a sheriff’s deputy checked her driver’s license, she could smell the 2 ounces of marijuana that Kistler had bought at Denver dispensaries and brought on her visit to Gillette. 
Once a drug dog indicated there were drugs in Kistler’s car, the deputy searched inside and looked through a black case, which held individually packaged bags of marijuana. She also found a backpack that contained some marijuana, a grinder, an extra cellphone and a digital scale. 
Kistler, who lived in Denver at the time, was in Gillette visiting friends and told officers that she had sold 0.25 ounces to a friend’s sister for $100 earlier that day. She was arrested and charged with possession with intent to deliver, a felony, and possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. 
“It happens all the time,” Kistler said about people getting arrested in Campbell County after legally buying marijuana in other states. “I’ve known people to get caught and I’ve known people to not ever get caught. It’s comparable to a game of Russian roulette for sure.” 
Wyoming is one of 20 states where marijuana remains illegal for both recreational use and the majority of medical uses and borders Colorado, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. 
Two years after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, Nebraska and Oklahoma, two of its neighbors, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down parts of the voter-approved legalization measure by arguing that the growth of marijuana dispensaries in Colorado increased the presence of marijuana in other states, straining the criminal justice system. 
In 2016, the Supreme Court declined to hear the states’ lawsuit, leaving legalization intact. Colorado has since continued to issue a growing number of licenses to marijuana dispensaries and several neighboring states have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. 
As the legalization of marijuana spreads, the effects on Campbell County remain anecdotal. 
Neither the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office nor the Gillette Police Department tracks the source of drugs it finds, making it impossible to know how marijuana bought legally in other states has affected Campbell County. 
Officers have noticed an increasing amount of marijuana in dispensary packaging since legalization in nearby states, said Police Lt. Brent Wasson. They also are finding more marijuana edibles and THC oils. 
In 2015, the Police Department started separately recording the amount of edibles and liquid marijuana products it seizes annually rather than combining those items with marijuana plant seizures. 
Because 2015 is three years after recreational marijuana legalization in Colorado and several years after a handful of states in the region legalized medical marijuana, the Police Department data can’t yet show whether legalization has caused the increase in edibles and liquid marijuana. 
Police drug arrests overall have increased for the last 10 years, but the amount of marijuana seized has stayed relatively constant, according to the department’s annual reports. 
Like the Police Department, Wyoming Highway Patrol and the Sheriff’s Office are finding an increase in commercially packaged marijuana products. These include marijuana plants, edibles and THC-infused products and are from dispensaries all over the country. 
“I would say it’s very common for us to find dispensary-related stuff when there is an incident involving marijuana,” said Deputy Dave Hauber. “We see dispensary jars and edible packaging, and I think as time has passed since Colorado’s legalization, we’ve seen more and more of it.” 
Because so much Colorado marijuana is transported into neighboring states since recreational marijuana was legalized, it’s now considered a source state rather than a user state, like Wyoming. 
“A lot of the marijuana we find here is from Colorado, and that wasn’t always the case,” Hauber said. 
Based on her experience, Kistler said she thinks legalization has led to more arrests and seizures of marijuana. 
“It’s not really always people trying to sell it,” she said. “People get tired of dealing with the law out here. It’s easier, cheaper and lower risk than working with people in town because you never know who’s going to drop names to get a lesser sentence when they get caught.” 
There is limited data on the effects of marijuana legalization particularly because it happened recently. 
In one of the few analyses of how legalized marijuana in one state affects bordering states, researchers at Washington State University examined arrest information from an FBI database to compare marijuana-related arrests in counties that border Colorado and Washington both before and after the legalization of recreational marijuana. 
Their analysis showed a 30 percent increase in marijuana possession arrests among adults in counties bordering Washington and Colorado after legalization as compared to before. However, it’s possible that law enforcement increased traffic stops in border counties after legalization, accounting for the rise in arrests. 
They also found no change in arrests for the sale or growth of marijuana. 
Because this study was confined to border counties, the data analyzed didn’t include Campbell County. 
In a less comprehensive study, University of Nebraska researchers looked at the impact that medical marijuana in Colorado had on bordering Nebraska counties and found that marijuana-related arrests and the number of jail inmates in those Nebraska counties increased after medical legalization. 
The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a federally-funded task force with a well-documented anti-marijuana bias, publishes a widely cited annual report, which shows that marijuana legalization has led to significant diversion of marijuana from Colorado to other states, including Wyoming. 
In 2016 — the most recent year for which data is available — the group documented 252 felony arrests of people selling Colorado marijuana illegally. Likewise, seizures of Colorado marijuana by highway patrol officers across the country totaled 53 in 2005 and increased to 346 by 2016. It is not clear whether the arrests or seizures were a result of marijuana bought or grown legally in Colorado. 
The lack of information led Gov. Matt Mead in 2015 to form a council to review the existing research on the impacts of Colorado’s legalization of recreational marijuana on Wyoming. 
The council’s review found that it is difficult to find a link between marijuana use and other crimes. This means that if Colorado’s legalization has led to increased consumption of marijuana in Wyoming, it is unclear whether it has resulted in an increase in other crimes. 
However, the council noted that law enforcement across the state is increasing the number of officers trained as drug recognition experts because drugged driving — involving both marijuana and other drugs — is increasing. 
“Whether or not an adult can legally purchase these items Colorado, no one can legally possess any of it in Wyoming, and they certainly cannot consume any of these products and drive, yet we encounter people who choose to do this far too often,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Lt. Zilka. 
“There is a public debate about cannabis and why it should or should not be legal in Wyoming,” he added. “I would hope that people on any side of the argument could agree that no one should be driving while using marijuana/THC or any psychoactive product, yet that is how we find most of these substances.” 
Some law enforcement agencies, including Wyoming Highway Patrol, also are expanding their drug dog programs in response to troopers seeing more marijuana-related crimes since Colorado’s legalization. 
Troopers found that in 2009, 18 percent of marijuana-related incidents involved Colorado marijuana, while in 2015, the number had grown to 46 percent, according to the governor’s council report. The data doesn’t specify whether this marijuana was legally or illegally obtained in Colorado. 
The Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, which annually aggregates arrest data from across the state, started tracking marijuana-related arrests separately from other drug arrests in 2014, two years after Colorado’s legalization. This means the association’s data doesn’t reveal the effects marijuana legalization has had on Wyoming. 
For those who are arrested here, the effects can be long-lasting. 
Because of her arrest, Kistler had to give up her apartment in Denver and move back to Gillette to attend court appearances. 
In May, eight months after she was pulled over, District Court Judge John R. Perry gave her a deferred sentence for possession with intent to deliver, which means if she completes five years of supervised probation, the charges will be dismissed. He also gave her a suspended one-year jail sentence in favor of one year of unsupervised probation for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. 
Kistler said she hasn’t had trouble following the rules and restrictions of probation and foresees being able to complete her sentences successfully. 
“I do wish I got eventually transferred back to Colorado, but that is most definitely going to be a process since I lost my place,” she said. 
She’s now living and working in Gillette, paying her court fees, communicating with her probation officer and hoping to move on.

CHEYENNE – The Wyoming Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday recommended approval of a bill that would clarify state law on marijuana edibles. 
Senate File 96 would make it illegal to possess any baked goods, candies or similar substances containing marijuana or its active ingredient, THC. In the past, some district court judges have been reluctant to adjudicate cases involving marijuana edibles, since it’s difficult to determine how much THC they contain. 
SF 96 was amended so that anyone caught with three or more ounces (down from one pound) of edibles would be committing a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Lesser amounts would be a misdemeanor. 
Sen. Michael Von Flatern, R-Gillette, opposed both the bill and its amendment, arguing that there isn’t a reliable enough way of testing THC content in edibles, and it wasn’t right for someone to become a felon for having, say, three pounds of brownies with only a very small amount of THC content. 
But the bill ultimately succeeded on a 4-1 vote and will move to the Senate floor for three more readings.

            Wyoming DCI says CBD oils legally ambiguous
        
","This May 23, 2017, photo shows GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex, a medicine made from the marijuana plant but without THC. On April 19 a panel of Food and Drug Administration health advisers recommended approval of the drug, moving the closely watched medication closer to the U.S. market. Associated Press 
CHEYENNE – State laws regarding various controlled substances are sometimes puzzling, especially when it comes to cannabis. 
The Wyoming Legislature recently debated whether to strengthen laws pertaining to edible or concentrated marijuana, once again failing to reach agreement on the issue. But some, particularly those suffering from chronic illness, are demanding clarity on an element of cannabis that lacks psychoactive properties – cannabidiol, most notably found in CBD oil. 
Cannabidiol is one of the two main molecules in marijuana, the other being tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is known to have mind-altering effects. 
Recent studies suggest that CBD oil may treat epilepsy, anxiety, schizophrenia, heart disease and cancer. The molecule attaches itself to certain receptors in the body to act as a pain reliever, using methods similar to those of THC without the associated high. 
Last year, a report from the World Health Organization found that no public health problems are associated with the use of CBD, suggesting it has little potential for abuse. 
Wyoming is one of a number of states that have not legalized marijuana, but have laws directly related to CBD and other hemp extracts. 
During the 2015 legislative session, Wyoming’s “hemp extract bill” legalized the use of these products for registered epileptic patients. The extracts must be extremely low in THC and high in CBD – those containing less than 0.3 percent THC and more than 5 percent CBD by weight are legal with a registration card. 
The law requires neurologists to provide a statement to the Wyoming Department of Health detailing how a patient would benefit from hemp extracts, after which they may qualify for registration. 
Since 2015, there have been a total of 34 applications made, with 26 unique cards issued, which must be renewed annually, according to health department spokeswoman Kim Deti. 
Right now, there are approximately nine individuals with active, approved cards in Wyoming. 
The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation says CBD oils are being distributed at multiple locations throughout Wyoming, including in pet stores, convenience stores and grocery stores. 
In Wyoming, it is illegal to possess, use or distribute any substance containing THC without this hemp extract registration card. 
“The CBD oils are legal to possess as long as they do not have THC in them,” DCI Commander Matt Waldock said. “But, if the CBD oils contain even a trace of THC, the only way to legally possess it is with a card.” 
That said, it can be difficult to know exactly how much, if any, THC exists in CBD oils. 
“I don’t know how accurate the THC contents are,” Waldock said. “Businesses may be selling CBD oil that says it has none, but we have tested some and found trace amounts. I think the quality control there is lacking on the testing process, but the bottom line is right now we are trying to educate people.” 
CBD oil is marketed in everything from liquid drops to lotions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve these products for any purpose, which means their production and distribution are not subject to federal regulation. 
For this reason, it can be difficult to know whether a product has the properties stated on its packaging. 
If someone is caught with THC-laced CBD oil, the DCI has the legal authority to charge them with possession of a controlled substance, but Waldock said the department is looking to set the record straight first. 
“Obviously, if we were going to charge someone, we would work with the jurisdiction and get multiple opinions on what we should do about it. But I think there is some confusion about this topic, so I would like people to have the right information first.” 
Waldock also said it can be difficult to determine if a product is laced with THC, due to limited personal-use testing facilities in the state. 
“Just use your best judgment,” he said.

            Wyoming medical marijuana initiative doesn’t make 2018 ballot
        
","CHEYENNE – A medical marijuana initiative that had been in the works since 2015 won’t be on the ballot in 2018 after the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office did not receive petitions by last Tuesday’s deadline. 
Nonetheless, medical marijuana supporters said they will continue to push for legalization of medical marijuana in Wyoming. 
The deadline for the petition was 18 months after the petition began in 2015. 
While the Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) helped with the signature drive, the organization was not the official sponsor of the petition. 
On Monday, Wyoming NORML issued a statement saying the organization had turned in its signatures to the original sponsors, though Wyoming NORML Director Frank Latta told the Gillette News Record he thought the petition would be short signatures. 
However, those never made it to the Secretary of State’s office. 
Secretary of State’s Office spokesman Will Dinneen confirmed last week that signatures had not been received. 
The original organizers of the medical marijuana petition, known formally as the Peggy A. Kelley Wyoming Cannabis Act, were hoping to get the initiative on the 2016 ballot. 
When there weren’t enough signatures for the 2016 ballot, the effort continued with the goal of 2018. 
In the meantime, there was infighting among other marijuana groups, which may have hurt the potential success of the petition. 
Since the petition began, Wyoming NORML has new leadership and has had a presence at the Legislature this session. 
The group is now focused on legalizing medical marijuana. 
Carrie Satterwhite, a spokeswoman for Wyoming NORML, said the group will continue its efforts in the Legislature and potential ballot initiatives. 
“We feel very confident in how things should go from here,” she said. 
Satterwhite said she thinks infighting among other groups was a factor in public perception of the initiative. 
“People saw the infighting as being us,” she said. “There’s been no fighting in our group. We’ve all been on the same page.” 
Disagreement in other groups also negatively affected the number of signatures that were actually collected, she said. 
But Satterwhite says “the support is there” for medical marijuana, giving the group reason to continue its efforts. 
“A few years ago, nobody was even talking about it,” she said. “We’re making strides.” 
Latta said Wyoming NORML will have a board meeting next week to talk about the next steps. 
A University of Wyoming poll in October found that more Wyoming residents support legalizing marijuana now than in 2014. 
Support for medical marijuana (with a doctor’s prescription) increased from 74 percent in 2014 to 81 percent in 2016. 
Marijuana for personal use also saw increased support, from 37 percent in 2014 to 41 percent in 2016 – though the majority of respondents are still against it. 
Additionally, 72 percent of Wyoming residents feel possession of small amounts of marijuana should not result in jail time, compared to 66 percent in 2014. 
State lawmakers have discussed several bills dealing with marijuana. 
Only one bill has continued to move forward: House Bill 197, sponsored by Rep. Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne. 
As originally written, the bill would have created a tiered penalty system for marijuana possession violations in which each subsequent offense in a 10-year period would get a higher penalty. 
The bill would have also filled the “edibles loophole,” which refers to the situation in Wyoming law that does not adequately address edibles or other marijuana-infused products. 
Under the proposed law, someone caught with less than 3 ounces of marijuana in plant form or 8 ounces of a marijuana-infused product would face a fine of up to $200 and/or 20 days in jail for a first offense. Penalties increase for the second and third offenses, culminating with a felony on the fourth offense. 
The bill passed the House of Representatives with a change to make the look-back period five years instead of 10. 
However, the Senate Judiciary Committee last week reversed that change and was confronted with several other changes suggested by people who testified at the committee meeting. 
That committee also removed the plant form of marijuana from the bill entirely, making it only applicable to marijuana-containing products. 
The committee did not vote on the bill, instead tabling it to a future meeting, likely this week. 
While Wyoming NORML was not opposed to the original bill, Latta told the A Better Wyoming blog that changes that lessen the penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana would cause NORML to no longer support the bill. 
Latta, a former state lawmaker himself and past mayor of Gillette, has been a regular presence at the Legislature and has spoken during hearings on marijuana bills. 
Other marijuana bills this session included attempts to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana on first offense. 
After that bill didn’t make it out of committee, attempts were made to insert such a provision in HB 197, but Olsen and others fought back, saying the bill was not meant to be a decriminalization bill. 
Another bill that would have recognized medical marijuana cards from other states also failed. 
Further, Reps. James Byrd, D-Cheyenne, and Mark Baker, R-Rock Springs, introduced House Joint Resolution 11, which would have put a ballot initiative on the 2018 ballot for voters to decide whether to legalize medical and recreational marijuana. 
That resolution was never heard in the House. 
Regardless, there could be evidence of changing opinions among lawmakers. 
After medical marijuana patients testified at a House Judiciary Committee meeting a few weeks ago, several lawmakers said hearing personal experiences may be causing them to evolve on the issue. 
“I think they are; as the nation moves and as they continue to get educated,” Latta said when asked if he thought the Legislature was becoming more accepting of medical marijuana. 
Latta said he hopes the topic is discussed during interim committees, which would allow more doctors and medical marijuana patients to share their experiences with lawmakers. 
“We’ve already proven we have the numbers there,” he said. “It’s just taken time. I think we’re in great shape.” 
Following the November general election, recreational marijuana is or will be legal in Colorado, Washing-ton, Oregon, Alaska, California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. 
Medical marijuana is legal in more than half the states in the country, including Colorado and Montana.

            Laramie County state House candidates debate in forum
        
","Martinez during House District 44’s public forum, hosted by the League of Women Voters, on Tuesday, July 10, 2018, at Cheyenne City Council Chambers at City Hall in Cheyenne. Jacob Byk/Wyoming Tribune Eagle 
CHEYENNE – Candidates for three of Laramie County’s state House districts disagreed about issues such as alternatives to incarceration and economic diversification and discussed a number of other issues at a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters on Tuesday night at Cheyenne City Council Chambers at City Hall. 
Candidates attended from House District 10, which covers much of Laramie County east of Cheyenne and a sliver of eastern Goshen County; House District 12, which is located in the southwest corner of Laramie County; and House District 44, which primarily covers the downtown Cheyenne area, south of Pershing Boulevard and north of Interstate 80. 
Marguerite Herman, a League of Women Voters of Cheyenne member, moderated one panel for each race and asked similar questions on a variety of topics. All of the candidates had 90 seconds to answer each question, as well as 30 seconds to respond to their opponents. 
House District 10 
All three candidates vying for the House District 10 seat attended the forum. 
Incumbent Rep. John Eklund, a Republican, said he decided to run again because he had “unfinished business,” including bringing a skilled nursing center for veterans to the state and updating a Wyoming Department of Transportation database that keeps track of licensing information. 
Republican challenger Donn Edmunds said he wanted to do more to bring and keep young people in the state, and Democratic challenger Jenefer Pasqua said she’d focus on education funding and quality. 
While all three candidates said they support local control of money allocated for schools, Eklund and Pasqua debated on how much should be spent in that arena. 
Pasqua emphasized the need for “fully funding” education, meaning that she advocated for allocating the full amount of money calculated for each district using a formula based on student populations, property taxes and other measures – something that hasn’t always happened in the past. 
But Eklund said while there is a constitutional obligation to fund education, Wyoming already receives a high amount of per-pupil spending compared to other states. 
“There are few states that fund education as high as Wyoming,” he said. “There is a lot of question as to whether it is fully funded or whether it was (previously) overfunded.” 
The three candidates also disagreed on the state’s role in building prisons and paying for alternative programs for people convicted of crimes, such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. 
Edmunds said the state prison system already has many options for people who are incarcerated. 
“Most people who go to prison, it’s like going to college” because the people have so much time to read and exercise, he said. 
Eklund largely agreed, saying the state routinely has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the country. 
“Whatever we’re doing in our prison system is pretty good,” he said. 
He also said he didn’t think it was the Legislature’s job to determine whether somebody should qualify for alternatives to incarceration, such as community treatment. 
But Pasqua said the state needed to do more for people suffering from mental illness. 
“The main reason (mental illness) goes untreated is because there aren’t resources to pay for treatment,” she said. 
Pasqua said the state should spend more money on mental health treatment programs both in prisons and statewide. 
House District 12 
Republican Connie Czarnecki was the only candidate to physically appear at the forum, but a longtime friend of Republican candidate Clarence Styvar, Jana Ginten, appeared on his behalf. And Pasqua read a short statement for Democrat Ryan Lindsey. 
In the statement, Lindsey pledged to “focus on things that bring us together” as a state. 
Both of the men weren’t able to make it due to work obligations. 
When asked about education funding, Ginten cited Styvar’s involvement in improving education for children with disabilities. 
Ginten said that although Wyoming spends a lot for each student compared to other states, “we have very little to show for it as far as academic achievement.” 
She said Styvar would advocate for more accountability in school spending. 
But Czarnecki said she thought schools were generally fiscally responsible and there needed to be trust-building between the Legislature and local districts. 
“The local school boards know exactly what they need,” she said. “Most people on the boards are fiscally responsible, at least in my experience.” 
The candidates also differed on whether to tax tobacco in an effort to deter people from smoking. 
Czarnecki said as a surgical assistant and former smoker, she has seen the negative effects of smoking. 
“I would be in favor of a tax if it would deter anyone from smoking,” she said. 
Styvar’s answer was simple. 
“No new taxes,” Ginten said. 
House District 44 
Republican Paul Johnson was unable to attend the forum due to work obligations, but a statement was read on his behalf. 
In it, he talked about his top priorities for the state, including figuring out a solution to a “boom and bust” economy, attracting alternative health insurance options and “keeping dollars in the classroom” instead of cutting education. 
Democrat Sara Burlingame and Republican John Romero-Martinez both attended. They found a few points of agreement, including favoring the legalization of medical marijuana and promoting certain aspects of criminal justice reform. 
Both also agreed the state needed to take steps to bolster the technology sector. 
Romero-Martinez didn’t share many specifics on that point, but said in the past Wyoming had missed out on opportunities to break into the industry. 
But Burlingame cited her involvement in a tech jobs tour that brought prospective employers to the state to talk to tech-minded individuals in Wyoming. 
“It was really energizing to be a part of this,” she said. “We can position ourselves as tech innovation leaders.” 
Burlingame said she wanted to give young people more opportunities to thrive. 
She said part of that would be making sure there is equity in education – ensuring that low-income students are well-cared for. Overall, she said Wyoming’s public schools are “top notch.” 
Romero-Martinez focused on civil rights in schools and in the broader public. He said the state should especially focus on the rights of “unborn children,” religious groups and other protected classes.

            Wyoming House makes last-minute changes to “stand your ground” bill
        
","Cheyenne, visits with Sen. Drew Perkins, R-Casper, during the 64th Wyoming Legislature's budget session on Thursday, March 8, 2018, at the Jonah Business Center in Cheyenne. Blaine McCartney/Wyoming Tribune Eagle 
CHEYENNE – Last-minute changes came to a so-called “stand your ground” bill in the Wyoming House of Representatives, while another similar bill remains in flux in the Senate. 
While the concept of “stand your ground” has largely enjoyed the support of lawmakers in the Wyoming Legislature, it hasn’t been smooth sailing for the bills. House Bill 168 easily made it through its chamber of origin. But Senate File 71 went through a back-and-forth of amendments before moving to the House. 
The bill’s proponents – including its sponsor, Sen. Anthony Bouchard, R-Cheyenne – were concerned senators posing complex legal questions about immunity provisions in the original bill gutted SF 71 with amendments. On third and final reading in the Senate, the bill was amended to include provisions that shooters needed to hold an “honest” belief their safety was threatened, whether “real or apparent.” Another amendment also added protection for those who threaten use of deadly force to diffuse potential deadly outcomes. 
During the Senate Agriculture Committee meeting Tuesday evening, lawmakers amended the House bill to mirror the amended Senate version. Both bills passed their respective chamber’s committees that day. 
But on Friday, SF 71 came to the floor for its third and final reading. Rep. Mike Gierau, R-Jackson, brought an amendment to make it so civil immunity would not apply if a person engaged in the use of defensive force “recklessly injures or kills another whom the person did not intend to use the reasonable defensive force against.” 
Debate ensued, with lawmakers arguing a broad swath of reasons. Some questioned whether existing statute would already not allow for civil immunity in such a circumstance. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said the amendment’s sponsor was trying to “kill a bill (he) doesn’t like.” The House bill’s sponsor, Rep. Tim Salazar, R-Dubois, agreed with Biteman. 
Gierau made it clear he did not support the bill when he made the amendment, but wanted to make it more palatable assuming it would pass. 
The amendment was adopted by a voice vote, and the bill passed the House 51-9 on its final reading. In order to make its way to the governor’s desk, SF 71 would need to go back to the Senate for a vote on concurrence. 
On Friday, the Senate laid back HB 168, meaning the chamber could vote on it when it convenes today. 
Marijuana reform dies again 
The Wyoming Legislature has once again failed to pass marijuana law reforms. 
Senators passed their marijuana reform bill last week, which follows the House killing its version of the bill in the Legislature’s first week. 
The Joint Judiciary Committee passed two bills during the interim, one for each chamber, attempting to reform marijuana laws to address several concerns put forth by law enforcement and the courts. Products infused with cannabis, such as edibles and liquids, continue to vex policymakers in terms of what amounts constitute felonies. 
Senate File 23 seemed viable until the House did not consider it for the Committee of the Whole, killing the legislation Wednesday. 
Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said it’s frustrating to see it fail again. But the complexity of the matter has made moving the policies forward a challenge for a body of lawmakers somewhere between favoring legalization and further criminalization. 
Despite the apparent impasse, Nethercott said she’s confident the needle is being moved closer to codifying marijuana reform. 
“With more time comes a greater understanding of how these products are affecting people and what appropriate regulation is,” she said. 
On the other hand, Rep. Charles Pelkey, D-Laramie, said he hasn’t seen “an inch of progress.” 
“It’s time to concede that we are at an impasse, with the House staking out a more moderate position,” he said in an email. “Let’s stop wasting time until we get some new folks in both bodies.” 
All blockchain bills move forward 
Wyoming is now set up statutorily to become a national and world leader in the blockchain sector, if the legislative measures’ proponents are correct. 
All five bills related to blockchain technology – House Bill 19, House Bill 70, House Bill 101, House Bill 126 and Senate File 111 – made their way through the Wyoming Legislature during the 2018 session. All await the governor’s signature except HB 19, which was signed earlier this week. 
Blockchain is essentially a digital ledger for storing information, including cryptocurrency. Crypto-currencies – the most commonly known is bitcoin – are essentially money. Many have touted Wyoming as an ideal place for the blockchain sector to flourish. Given Wyoming’s need for economic diversification going forward, state lawmakers have gone all-in on making sure statutes can foster the sector. 
One of the Legislature’s leading proponents of the bills, Rep. Tyler Lindholm, R-Sundance, said Friday the push has been a success. While there’s a chance nefarious entities will try to take advantage of Wyoming’s statutes, he said he’s confident the secretary of state’s office has the tools it needs to address concerns. But as with any legislation, Lindholm said there can always be “unintended consequences.” 
“We don’t know where this is going to go or how it’s going to happen, but Wyoming is going to lead the way in the U.S. and the world,” he said. “That’s fascinating and really exciting.” 
CHEYENNE – Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead did not release any information about legislative measures he vetoed before press time Wednesday.

            Drug suspect disputes chase details
        
","Casey Hardison, the supposed drug dealer who police chased through town last week, is challenging almost every detail of the investigation. 
Hardison is wanted in Teton County on charges of delivery of marijuana and aggravated assault and battery after he allegedly sold pot to an undercover cop last week and then took off, resulting in a high-speed chase through Jackson. 
“After the handover with Mikey, a white truck stopped like he didn’t know where he was going,” Hardison told the News&Guide in a telephone interview from an undisclosed location. “The white truck tried to box me in. Then I saw two guys. I just threw it into gear and punched it.” 
Agents with the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigations had been planning the sting for over a year, according to documents, and said it was the result of several undercover drug deals with Hardison. 
But the attempted arrest left Hardison with $6,000 of government cash and cops with 2 pounds of marijuana. 
Police say Hardison almost ran them over when he realized he was about to be arrested. 
“Special agents jumped from the path of Hardison’s vehicle to avoid being struck,” court records state. 
But Hardison said he took off because he thought he was being robbed. 
“They were in unmarked cars and plain clothes,” Hardison said. “They displayed no insignia and were wearing none. At that point in time I had the right to protect my safety.” 
Hardison disputes most details of the probable cause affidavit, in which police shared details in order to get a judge’s signature on the arrest warrant. 
“As far as the officers approaching, there was no possible way for them to come to harm,” Hardison said. “It’s exaggerated and inaccurate. I had no intention of such thing. I was fleeing a scene where I was possibly being attacked by unknown intruders.” 
Police said they chased Hardison for a short time through Jackson but eventually stopped because of safety reasons. 
“As Hardison sped away a brief pursuit was conducted by law enforcement vehicles displaying emergency lights and sirens,” documents state. “Based on Hardison’s actions while driving, high speeds, numerous turns down streets and obvious disregard for the safety of the public, law enforcement ended any further attempts to stop Hardison’s vehicle.” 
But Hardison said he got away and police continued to search for him. 
“There were no lights,” Hardison said. “I pulled away and made the next right turn and next right turn. They pursued me all the way across South Park. They claimed they stopped for safety. I hooked into this little neighborhood and ditched myself out of view and saw them pursuing through the neighborhood.” 
Hardison is claiming entrapment and says the cops should stop dedicating so many resources to marijuana investigations. 
“They’re after me because they want a big fish,” Hardison said. “There are a ton of drugs in Jackson Hole, and I am certainly not supplying them. They have other drugs and other people they should be pursuing, real gangsters. People die from alcohol, tobacco, heroin, meth and cocaine.” 
Hardison, 47, is best known for challenging U.S. drug laws and spending time in prison for running a European LSD lab. 
In various articles he’s referred to as a semifamous drug wizard and a chemist. 
“My intention is to launch a constitutional assault through the state of Wyoming against the entire Controlled Substances Act in the federal system,” Hardison said. “The war on drugs is not a war on drugs. It’s a war on some people who use some drugs.” 
Hardison says dash cam video or nearby surveillance will back up his story as to what happened Aug. 6. 
“It would have played out differently if they had effectively played their game,” Hardison said. “They didn’t box me in.” 
Police said the investigation into Hardison started in June 2017 when a confidential informant bought a pound of marijuana from him. 
They arranged another undercover deal in March 2017, according to documents. 
Several DCI agents were involved in the Hardison sting. 
Agents have also been busy investigating stores in the state that are selling cannabidol products, saying they are illegal because they have trace amounts of THC. 
Stores like Jackson Whole Grocer and Lucky’s Market pulled their CBD products earlier this month after agents with DCI said they could face criminal charges. 
“Who in their command structure has such an anal-retentive view?” Hardison said. “Maybe they should use a CBD repository and transform their point of view.” 
Deputy Director of DCI Forrest Williams said their drug investigations involve all illegal substances. 
“We work violations under the Controlled Substance Act and that includes all the substances that are illegal,” Williams said. “The majority of our cases are methamphetamine cases.” 
A warrant was issued for Hardison’s arrest on Aug. 8 on several counts of delivery and aggravated assault and battery.

Casey Hardison 
Once again... how could anyone in there right mind think that Cannabis is a drug.. it’s a flower that the good lord gave us to use.. it’s all about money and taking people property and making money from them ,it has nothing to do with anything else .. CBD AND THC KILL CANCER !!! But it’s ok to sell tobacco because of why ??? money!! It’s simple math.. a sting op is entrapment!!  Almost every state has some form of legal herb. Why not Wyoming?? Why not tax it and put money into the pocket of the state..  We spend so much on “trying to keep it  illegal “ when we could be making money hand over fist with it legal?? 
Since you are talking about ""flowers"" that the good lord gave us to use, let's not forget the opium poppy from which most of the world's heroin supply is derived.  I also find it interesting that most people forget that marijuana smoke contains 37 common carcinogens to tobacco smoke; take a look at the California EPA report one day and then tell me that marijuana is harmless. There are also studies that show that significant exposure of the developing brain to marijuana smoke (i.e. teenagers) can lead to permanent alterations in brain chemistry and functioning. The literature is there if anyone is inclined to do a little homework.

            Cops say drug suspect eluded them in chase
        
","An undercover special agent bought $6,000 worth of drugs from Casey Hardison on Monday night, but when his backup officers moved in to arrest the suspect, Hardison took off. 
The exchange almost resulted in two special agents being run over by Hardison, cops reported, and launched a high-speed chase through the town of Jackson. 
Monday’s sting was planned after a year of undercover drug deals with Hardison, police said. 
A confidential informant bought a pound of marijuana from Hardison in June 2017. 
In March an undercover agent met with Hardison and bought 2 pounds of marijuana. 
“Hardison opened a black case, which Hardison took from the trunk of his car ... and removed two large, sealed packages of marijuana,” a probable cause affidavit states. 
On Monday night at 7:30 the same undercover agent met Hardison and two other people and arranged to buy 3 pounds of marijuana. 
The group hung out at a brewery until just after 9 p.m. and moved to a nearby intersection where the undercover officer bought five bags of pot for $6,000. 
Other agents of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation and detectives of the Teton County Sheriff’s Office moved in and parked to block Hardison’s car, documents state. 
Hardison grabbed his steering wheel and started to drive off as police approached. 
“Special agents jumped from the path of Hardison’s vehicle to avoid being struck,” court records state. 
Police chased Hardison through Jackson. 
“As Hardison sped away a brief pursuit was conducted by law enforcement vehicles displaying emergency lights and sirens,” documents state. “Based on Hardison’s actions while driving, high speeds, numerous turns down streets and obvious disregard for the safety of the public, law enforcement ended any further attempts to stop Hardison’s vehicle.” 
Hardison has several pending delivery charges in Teton County, police said. A warrant for his arrest was pending Tuesday evening. 
Hardison is well known for his drug activity. The 47-year-old is a semi-famous LSD chemist who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for running a European LSD lab, according to a 2004 Vice article. 
Hardison was also a witness in a coroner’s inquest into the death of a local artist. Hardison was partying with Anthony Birkholz on the night he died. 
Hardison hosted a fundraiser in Jackson after Birkholz died. He also raised money online and promised to donate it to the Buffalo Field Campaign. But the memorial money ended up in police custody in Idaho after Hardison was arrested there last year for drug possession. 
The charges were later dismissed and prosecutors there said the cash was returned to Hardison. But employees at the Buffalo Field Campaign said they’ve never received the promised donation. Hardison said in January that he planned to raise the money by hosting an online blotter art sale, but an organizer said the sale didn’t go as planned. 
“I will keep raising money for the Buffalo Field Campaign as long as they exist and as long as I do,” Hardison told the News&Guide then.

No doubt this clown needs to spend time in jail.. repeatedly doing stupid stuff and endangering human lives. However I feel like this article is trying to make  marijuana the real culprit here or at least an accomplice. The articles headline sensationalizes this, and that’s unfortunate. Marijuana for recreation and medical CBD oil, hemp for all of the great products that can be manufactured from it should be legal. Report the facts of the case. The weed is guilty of nothing quit demonizing it. 
Dope on dope, fleeing the Police without regard to the safety of others is despicable. 
What a waste of my tax money... free the weed !! When will the good people of this state legalize the healing herb.. CBD kills cancer , stops Seizures and helps with ptsd and just by a simple plant the the good lord made and at the end of that day he sed itt was GOOD... stop spending money on fighting the herb and start spending on education for those uneducated people who think it’s a” terrible drug epidemic “  and sting operations are Essentially entrapment.. FREE THE HEALING HERB!!!! 
A lot of holes in this story. Is the money and the dope gone? Maybe the cops should be investigated. 
Hi Ken, the drugs are being tested at the state lab and when they're not they are kept in evidence storage in Afton, according to documents. Thanks for reading.

            Senate approves bill to update penalties for marijuana edibles, vape pens
        
","Partially in response to several cases in the past few years in which people in possession of marijuana edibles have been given on misdemeanors because of current law, the Wyoming Senate passed a bill specifying penalties for nonplant form marijuana. 
The Wyoming Senate approved a bill specifying penalties for the possession of nonplant form marijuana by a vote of 19 to 11. 
Currently, Wyoming does not prosecute possession of nonplant form marijuana as a felony. Several cases, including one in Teton County, were thrown out or reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor last year because state law only applied to the plant form of the drug. 
“This does create an interesting situation with this ruling by the court that I want to clarify,” Teton County Deputy Prosecutor Clark Allan said during Daniel Bates’ sentencing in Teton County last year. “A person can come through with 4 ounces of plant form marijuana and be convicted of a felony and sent to the penitentiary, but if a person has an 18-wheeler full of gummy candies, it’s just a misdemeanor.” 
Should the bill pass, possession of no more than 0.3 grams of liquid marijuana, 3 grams of resin or 3 ounces of another form of nonplant-form marijuana products would carry a misdemeanor charge resulting in no more than one year in prison and no more than a $1,000 fine. 
Anything more than the weights listed above would result in a felony charge. 
Conviction of third misdemeanor offense would carry an increased penalty of no more than five years in prison and no more than a $5,000 fine.

            CBD oils pulled from store shelves
        
","Jackson Whole Grocer was asked to pull CV Sciences’ CBD oil from its shelves after the product tested positive for THC. 
Jackson Whole Grocer had to pull CV Sciences’ CBD oil from its shelves. On Tuesday store employees turned away several people looking for it. 
Certain cannabidiol products have disappeared from shelves at Jackson Whole Grocer and Lucky’s Market after the stores received a visit from police. 
An ongoing investigation has sparked a debate on the legality of the substance in Wyoming. 
After being told the store would face charges if they didn’t pull CBD products, employees at Whole Grocer complied. 
“They were very kind,” Whole Grocer Vice President and General Manager Tom Scott said. “They didn’t come in here guns blazing.” 
The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation claims a product the stores were selling contains traceable amounts of THC, which it says makes it illegal to possess or sell. 
“They gave us seven days to get rid of it,” Whole Grocer Herbalist Heather Olson said. “We’re sad to see it go. It’s a great category for our department. It was a huge move forward for herbal medicine. But psychoactive chemicals in the product are not appropriate in Wyoming.” 
DCI agents say the only exception to possessing THC in Wyoming is if you have a “hemp extract registration card” issued by the Wyoming Department of Health. 
Those cards are rare, state officials said. 
One of the CBD products police say is testing positive for THC comes from CV Sciences, a CBD hemp-oil manufacturing and distributing company. 
“We will address this like any issue with our lobbyists and attorneys,” said Josh Hendrix, director of business development at CV Sciences. “It should be an easy conversation. But we need clear-cut legislation.” 
Hendrix disagrees with DCI on the product’s legality. 
“We don’t get our products from marijuana,” he said. “This has happened enough times that the misinterpretation gives us an opportunity to educate.” 
Olson said the product is popular with Whole Grocer customers. She turned away half a dozen customers on Tuesday alone. More than 50 bottles are now in a cardboard box in the back of the grocery store. 
CBD is often used by people who suffer from epilepsy, anxiety, depression, seizures and chronic pain. 
Olson said the stores will rely on the CBD companies to send certificates of analysis to confirm none of their other products have THC in them. 
Lucky’s Market also took products off shelves last week. 
“We’ve pulled the products in a gesture of good faith,” said store director Chris Martinez. “There were multiple brands we had to pull.” 
The Division of Criminal Investigation said lab analysis confirmed the presence of THC in “many of the items” it received. 
According to CV Sciences, CBD oil is derived from agricultural hemp, does not make you high and has “a remarkable safety profile.” 
The World Health Organization does not consider it a controlled substance. 
“Cannabidiol does not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm,” its website states. 
A World Health Organization expert committee continues to review the extracts. 
DCI Operations Commander Ronnie Jones told the News&Guide that his agents have been collecting CBD around Wyoming since late last year. 
“We are still conducting an investigation,” Jones said. 
DCI Deputy Director of Operations Forrest Williams said the investigation began because of inquiries from the public and law enforcement officers about CBD’s legality. 
“We have bought from stores in Casper, Cheyenne, Laramie, Gillette, Rock Springs, and whatever products we’ve bought we submit them to the lab for testing, and if it contains any amount of THC it’s illegal,” Williams said. 
Jones wouldn’t say that the ongoing investigation is a priority for DCI. But several agents around the state are involved. 
“They are wasting their time,” Hendrix said. “This is a very disruptive thing. Cannabis has been demonized for so long. I’ve grown hemp on my farm. You can’t get high off it.” 
Hendrix says the investigation is based off misinformation. 
“They have bigger things to worry about,” he said. “There are hard drugs on the steeets. This doesn’t harm anyone. It helps people.” 
Hendrix says his company plans to clear it up any confusion surrounding levels of THC in their products and where it comes from. 
“It’s kind of like decaf coffee or Kombucha,” Hendrix said. “There are kids that take this product.”

No wonder your dispatch is getting fake emergency calls.  They are trying to give you something better to do!  This is fantastic idea for people with the symptoms listed without relying on the use opioids or benzodiazepines! 
[thumbdown] When Wyoming comes out of the dark ages, let me know..my wife suffers from Addisons, PTSD, and pinched nerves in her neck which hemp oil with THC helps with. As Florida and soon TN wakes up to reality, I would hope Wyoming would as well. I don't fault the police just backwards laws that need to be changed. 
It’s important that the store management pulled down the hemp-based CBD oil from the shelves on the advice of the police, but it would have been more important, had the pulled down the illegal products on their own. The customers should source their medical CBD oil products more cautious and only from licensed dispensaries after getting recommendations from reputed licensed clinics like Online Medical Card, https://www.onlinemedicalcard.com/ 
Yes.... Wyoming you are smarter than this. What a huge waste of taxpayer dollars and resources. It’s time for our legislators to grow up and get over it! 
I dont smoke with Willie , but outlawing this stuff is simply ignorant. If it can provide any relief to those suffering they should have access to it. Come on Wyoming youre smarter than this 
Has there been any documentation of people being addicted to this product? If not , they might consider using opiods..!!!   SARCASAM !

            Blotter, May 2
        
","Hungry kids: At least four teenagers have tried to steal donuts from the grocery store this week. Officers have given several middle schoolers trespass notices for the attempted thefts. In most cases their parents were called to come get them. In at least one case a juvenile was cited for shoplifting. 
Too close for comfort: A man called police at 7:50 p.m. April 24 because he said a man erratically driving a pickup almost ran him over. The driver was heading toward Jackson from Grand Teton National Park and failed field sobriety tests after officers stopped him. The 42-year-old was arrested on charges of DUI, driving without a license, driving without insurance and speeding. 
Environmentally friendly pothead: Recycling center employees found a marijuana pipe and a baggie with suspected marijuana from a bin they picked up from Jackson Hole High School. The pipe is recyclable, but police took the drugs for destruction. 
Nosy neighbor: Someone called police April 25 because a neighbor was smoking pot in his apartment. Officers confiscated a pipe, a half-gram of marijuana and hash oil. 
Nontraditional funeral: Someone honored their dead dog by wrapping it in a blanket and leaving it near Mosquito Creek covered in rose petals, but police were called because no one buried the fallen pooch. Leaving carcasses and unnatural objects like blankets in the forest is frowned upon. 
Illegal variety pack: Just before midnight Thursday officers stopped a car near the entrance of the National Elk Refuge. Two people told police they were looking for a place to camp. Officers smelled marijuana, and the driver said he has a medical marijuana card and works in the cannabis industry in Colorado. Police located dispensary containers, a glass container with THC wax, a container of a coconut oil and THC mixture, a dropper bottle and a vape pen. The 25-year-old was arrested and charged with two felony counts of possession and one misdemeanor count. 
Rookie mistake: A man driving a box truck tried to park in the parking garage but ran into the structure and its clearance sign. The collision caused damage to the building and the truck, but the man took off without reporting it. As of Monday police had located the truck, but the suspect had not received a citation. 
Drunken intellectual: A heavily intoxicated man passed out on his keyboard at Teton County Library. Library employees called police because the man was unresponsive. Officers had to remove the man’s headphones to get his attention. His portable breath test registered 0.30 percent blood alcohol content, and he was arrested for public intoxication. 
What was the first job you had as a teen?: Two teenagers were arrested around 10:15 p.m. Friday with 170 grams of marijuana, glass pipes, rolling papers, razor blades, wire filters, a scale and $850 cash. A 17-year-old was arrested for felony possession and intent to deliver. The other 17-year-old was charged with misdemeanor possession. 
Late-night frosty dreams: A man was passed out in his driver’s seat in the Wendy’s drive-thru at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, and when officers tapped on his window he sped off. A short pursuit ensued until the man pulled over and told police he “freaks out when he sees reds and blues.” Surprisingly, the man wasn’t drunk. But he was arrested for eluding police.

            U.S. House of Representatives
        
","Three Republicans and two Democrats are competing for Wyoming’s sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of each party will advance. 
Liz Cheney (R, incumbent) 
Prior to serving in Congress, Liz Cheney practiced law and worked at the U.S. State Department. In the U.S. House she has supported legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, expand concealed carry and defund Planned Parenthood. 
“I have championed conservative reform to create jobs, cut taxes and regulation, expand America’s energy, mining and ag industries and restore the strength and power of our nation’s standing in the world,” Cheney said. 
She said she’ll work to reduce federal overreach, streamline regulations and return authority to states and local communities on public lands. 
Rod Miller (R) 
Rod Miller grew up on a Wyoming ranch and has worked on natural resources and federal lands in the offices of Wyoming Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan. 
“I have a deep understanding of how good government should operate in the Cowboy State, as well as issues crucial to the state gained from that experience,” he said. 
He supports the heaviest tax burden for those with the greatest wealth, separating religion from politics, legalization of marijuana, keeping public lands public, women’s rights and reducing defense spending while maintaining a strong military. 
Blake Stanley (R) 
Blake Stanley is a self-described “blue-collar conservative.” He’s pro-life and believes in limited government that allows business and industry to lead the Wyoming economy. 
“As a veteran, I think we have an obligation to take care of our nation’s protectors — from the day they enter service until the day they graduate from this earth,” Stanley said on his website. 
He supports border security, bolstering the military, and the federal government “stepping back” to give Wyoming control over its natural resources. 
Travis Helm (D) 
Travis Helm, a Laramie-based immigration attorney, touts his “solid Wyoming” connections and credentials. 
Helm said he’ll choose Wyoming priorities ahead of any national party agenda: “By being independent, I will make Wyoming’s vote actually worth something, and we will be able to negotiate the best outcomes for our state.” 
He cares about maintaining public lands, public universal health care and providing for rural health care, diversifying the state economy, and investing in infrastructure. He supports repealing Citizens United and fixing immigration laws. 
Greg Hunter (D) 
Greg Hunter is a Laramie businessman who has also worked with government agencies in Washington, D.C. 
“After 30-plus years working for federal agencies and public lands, I have the skills and experience to protect our lands, navigate legislation, and save the taxpayer money while achieving the goals important to Wyomingites,” he said. “Wyoming can be progressive and still maintain its Cowboy character.” 
He supports universal health care, compassionate immigration reform, overturning Citizens United, diversifying Wyoming’s economy, defending public lands, legalizing marijuana, and some regulation of guns.

","Friends through the good and bad: A man was pulled over at 2:30 a.m. July 23 for speeding. The 21-year-old Victor, Idaho, man admitted to having a few beers and had an open Modelo in the car. The man was arrested on charges of DUI, open container, driving without a valid license and speeding. His passenger, a 22-year-old Jackson man, had the chance to take a cab home but said he’d rather go to jail with his friend. He was booked on a charge of public intoxication. 
Odor eaters: A man pulled over for speeding tried to cover the smell of marijuana in his car with cologne and air freshener, police said. The 24-year-old was cited for possession and released. 
Cut off: A drunk man became so disruptive at The Wort Hotel after the bartender wouldn’t serve him more drinks that the cops were called and other patrons started to leave. “When he finally left he started yelling at people on the sidewalk in a threatening manner,” said Jackson police Lt. Roger Schultz. The 49-year-old Los Angeles man was arrested on charges of public intoxication and breach of peace. 
Whiskey and guns: Someone called police July 24 to report “a group of kids drinking whiskey and shooting guns” up Curtis Canyon. When deputies arrived they found the men, but they weren’t drunk, and they were shooting rounds legally. However, one of them had a warrant out for his arrest, so he was taken to jail, Teton County sheriff’s Sgt. Todd Stanyon said. 
Cotton candy with a side of pot: Some contract workers who were in town to sell food to patrons at the Teton County Fair were caught with over 648 grams of marijuana, police said. A 26-year-old male and a 25-year-old female, both from Arizona, were arrested on felony possession charges. 
Friendly drunks: Police stopped two people staggering down the middle of the road Thursday. The couple couldn’t keep their balance, reports stated. “We are drunk,” the man told officers. The 50-year-old Utah man failed a 20-step test, so he was arrested on a charge of public intoxication. 
Counting sheep: A man and woman were passed out in someone’s driveway Sunday, using a car’s tire for a pillow. “They were taking a dirt nap right there,” Schultz said. The two were drunk and didn’t want to drive, so they decided to sleep in a stranger’s driveway, reports said. They were arrested on charges of public intoxication. 
Caught in the act: An officer observed a man acting suspicious around 3:25 a.m. Saturday. The man was standing near a bike rack and looking around. The man then took one of the bikes and started riding off. An officer stopped the man and asked him if he’d stolen the bike. At first he claimed it was his friend’s bike. Then he admitted to lying and said he would put the bike back. “I’m just trying to go home, man,” he told the officer. The man was arrested on a charge of public intoxication.

            Talk to your kids about smoking marijuana
        
","Marijuana is, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the most commonly used illegal psychoactive substance in the world. In the United States, of course, marijuana is subject to changing state and often contradictory federal laws. 
Marijuana is increasingly being legalized for medical and recreational use around the U.S., and child health advocates expect this will result in an increase in its use among teens. Already 55 percent of U.S. high school seniors report having tried marijuana. Twenty-three percent report current ongoing use, and 6 percent report daily use or signs of addiction. 
The tricky thing about marijuana is that it defies categorization. It’s legal yet illegal. It’s natural yet medical. It’s safe yet harmful. All of these statements are simultaneously true. Such contradictory and nuanced ideas can be hard for parents to keep straight in their head, let alone an adolescent. 
Most parents would prefer that their adolescents not use marijuana, and experts strongly agree. However, beginning and ending a discussion about marijuana with, “It’s bad for you,” is unlikely to be effective. The conversation will probably require some nuance, like our understanding of pot itself. 
Open a discussion. Like in any talk with a teen, it’s best to be non-confrontational. Maybe ask, “Have you heard about anyone at school smoking pot?” 
Solicit and listen to your teens’ viewpoints without judgment. “What do you think people like about weed?” Or, “What do you like about weed?” It’s OK to recognize that the euphoric feeling one can get from a cannabis high is a legitimate thing to like. 
On the other hand, maybe they like it because it’s a way to self-medicate depression, anxiety or sleep problems. Maybe it’s to fit in, or maybe it’s because they don’t fit in. The opposite of addiction is community, or so substance abuse experts say. 
It’s certainly true that marijuana can be used as medicine. Research studies have shown that it can help those with chronic pain, side effects from chemotherapy, seizures, and perhaps glaucoma. Marijuana is certainly a safer medicine for chronic pain than narcotics. If adolescents are having chronic pain, however, they should be working with a doctor to fix the underlying cause. 
Next, ask what they don’t like about marijuana. It can make you feel anxious or paranoid. It decreases your short-term memory and attention span. It slows down your motor control, coordination, reaction time and judgment. 
A major study also has shown that long-term marijuana use initiated in adolescence has negative effects on intellectual ability, such as executive function and processing speed, which do not recover by adulthood even when cannabis use is discontinued. 
Adolescent marijuana users are more likely to suffer depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and schizophrenia (data on anxiety disorder are mixed). Smoking marijuana decreases your lung function, even if smoke is inhaled through a vaporizer, and may increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. It lowers sperm count and causes tooth and gum disease. 
Of note, I do not include the “gateway drug” theory among the known risks of marijuana here. This idea has increasingly been supplanted by the “common liability” theory; current studies suggest pre-existing genetic and environmental factors contribute to all substance abuse disorders. Therefore, specific use of any given drug at one time does not cause abuse of other substances later. Also, although cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogens as that of tobacco, it has not been definitively shown to cause cancer. 
So we can all come to the conclusion that marijuana has its good, but it also has its bad. Most experts believe that the bad clearly outweighs the good. This is especially true for adolescents, whose prefrontal cortex will continue to develop until their mid-20s. 
If your teens haven’t been exposed to marijuana yet, ask them to think about their personal reasons for using or not using the substance. Give them information to back it up. Ask them to think about what they would say if they were ever in a peer pressure situation — they could even rehearse the conversation with you. 
If your teen is smoking pot already, respectfully explore their perceptions. Just because marijuana is “medicinal” and “natural” doesn’t mean it’s safe. Opiates like morphine are medicines naturally derived from poppies, yet they and their synthetic cousins were responsible for over 42,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2016. 
If your teens already smoke marijuana you could challenge them to stop marijuana use for a defined period of time. Treat it as an experiment, to see how they feel different. If they can’t or won’t stop, that’s a red flag for a true substance abuse disorder. If they do stop, follow up with them at the end of the experiment. If things didn’t go well, explore why. 
At any time in this process, it’s a good idea to include your pediatrician in the discussion. Hopefully you and your child have developed a personal relationship with a doctor specifically trained in working with adolescents who can have a confidential discussion with your teen. 
The pediatrician can determine if criteria are met for a true substance use disorder, assess for indications that the teen might be self-medicating, and use proven techniques to help the teen make healthy decisions. When needed, the pediatrician can refer to another mental health professional with the tools to address the problem. The pediatrician can determine if the teen, or anyone else, is at imminent risk of harm (in this case, it might be necessary for the doctor to break confidentiality with the teen.) The American Academy of Pediatrics and many other national organizations consistently caution against involuntary drug testing in adolescents. 
Marijuana is a complicated topic with inherent contradictions; it warrants a candid, nonthreatening dialogue between parents and teens.

I have just a small issue with a statement in the third paragraph:  ""It's natural yet medicinal"".........It should read: ""It's natural and medicinal"".  I don't know what proportion of our medicines are derived from and synthesized from plants, but, correct me if I'm wrong, perhaps the majority of our medicines come from ""natural"" plants.  Therefore, it is certainly no surprise that it is natural yet medicinal.

            Blotter, April 11
        
","Bangkok noodle bandit: A man who was splurging on drinks and dinner at Teton Tiger last week “ran out the door” when he was given his $51.94 check, police said. It happened around 7:30 p.m. April 2, and police said they have a lead on who the thief might be. 
BBQ clobber: Police responded to Moe’s BBQ on April 2 around midnight after a woman punched another woman in the face. “The two females went there and got into an argument about one of their boyfriends,” Jackson police Lt. Roger Schultz said. “The argument was followed by a knuckle sandwich to the face.” The victim wasn’t seriously injured, but police are searching for the 30-year-old suspect. 
They’re onto you: Someone ordered almost $800 worth of skin care products with someone else’s credit card and sent them to the card owner’s house. “It’s not uncommon for scammers to send it to the correct address and then try to intercept it,” Schultz said. The card owner reported the fraudulent charges to police and returned the beauty products. 
No off-roading in town: A man was pulled over around midnight April 4 after he plowed through someone’s yard to turn westbound on Karns Avenue. The 25-year-old parked at Snow King Motel and refused to do any field sobriety tests but was arrested on a DUI charge anyway. 
Pick a room, any room: Four young adults were busted April 4 for trespassing and partying in a hotel room at the Virginian Lodge. The room was supposed to be unoccupied, but one of the individuals at the party had somehow acquired a room key. An 18-year-old female from Grover was arrested on a Lincoln County warrant and for being a minor in possession of alcohol. 
Grandma’s greens: A car was pulled over for going 47 mph in a 30 zone around 10:30 a.m. Saturday. The officer smelled marijuana, but the driver claimed she didn’t have any. Police found six marijuana cigarettes in the center console. The 63-year-old Bondurant woman was cited for speeding and possession and released on scene. 
Fresh dumpings: Some employees at the Lockhart Ranch called police on Sunday and said a person in an RV has been dumping human feces into their ditch. The individuals in the camper were warned, and they agreed to move on. 
Let’s get this over with, officer: A driver was pulled over after midnight Friday for going 33 mph in a 25 zone and for not coming to a complete stop at a red flashing light. Officers made contact with the man and smelled alcohol, reports said. The 53-year-old admitted to having a beer before driving, and during field sobriety tests he asked the officer, “How about we just go to jail?” The Blackfoot, Idaho, man was charged with driving without a license, open container and DUI.

Musser was arrested Oct. 27 when police pulled over a minivan at about 9 p.m. because it didn’t have headlights. The police officer smelled marijuana and asked the five people inside the minivan about it. Near where Musser had been sitting, police found a baggie with 7.1 grams of marijuana and a backpack with 1 gram of hash and paraphernalia. A drug dog indicated on a black filing cabinet in his office downstairs during a subsequent search of his house. That turned up 23 bags of 1⁄4-ounce portions of marijuana totaling 5.58 ounces. Elsewhere in the home, police found a bottle of liquid THC weighing 26 grams, a digital scale and loose marijuana, according to court documents.

            Changes to cannabis laws unlikely
        
","CHEYENNE – Efforts to strengthen Wyoming’s marijuana laws are likely dead for now. 
The Wyoming Legislature has found itself at an impasse in the last several sessions over the issue. The Joint Judiciary Interim Committee passed two bills leading up to the 2018 budget session, one for each chamber, attempting to change marijuana laws. They were meant to address concerns put forth by law enforcement and courts with regard to products flowing in from Colorado, where recreational and medical use are legal. 
Wyoming’s laws were written several decades ago, when the plant form of the drug was by far the most prevalent manifestation. Today, in addition to concentrates such as shatter and wax, edible and liquid-infused products are increasingly commonplace. 
Wyoming law states possession of 3 ounces or more of marijuana in plant form is considered a felony in the state, but it lacks definition when it comes to other products that are often higher in the drug’s intoxicating ingredient, THC. 
“The dilemma for the Legislature is that two judges looked at a pile of (cannabis-infused) gummy bears and said, ‘I don’t see any green-leafy, therefore you can’t tell me that gummy is green-leafy,’” said Byron Oedekoven, executive director of the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police. “So we have wrestled with defining that infused product, trying to come up with some equivalency to the green-leafy. Essentially, how many gummy bears does it take to make a felony?” 
Sarah Barrett of the Wyoming State Crime Lab reported to lawmakers in Wheatland last year that no new advances have been made since the 2017 session that might make it easier to discern how many doses are contained in a particular product. That led to some hesitancy on the part of lawmakers worried they would be voting for laws that could apply felony charges for relatively minor offenses. Add that to lawmakers who want to reform marijuana and cannabis laws to ease punishments and Wyoming has an impasse on changing its laws. 
The troubles for the bills in the House of Representatives came in the first week, when the chamber overwhelmingly voted against introducing the measure 49-10, with one excused. While the Senate’s measure passed with strong support throughout, it died a quiet death in the chamber down the hall when it was not introduced to the House’s Committee of the Whole. 
And it appears that is where the issue will lie for the foreseeable future. Oedekoven said this week it’s his understanding the Judiciary Committee has no interest in picking up the issue leading up to the 2019 general session. 
“(The Judiciary Committee said) we’ve beat this horse, we understand the issue,” he said. 
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Dan Kirkbride, R-Chugwater, said that’s probably accurate. 
“I think it has to do with not being able to accurately measure the THC,” Kirkbride said. “That process is not widely or inexpensively available, and there’s a number of legislators who would be reluctant to charge and incarcerate people if they think it’s done unfairly. We’ve worked on it for three to four years, and we’re just kind of stuck.” 
Though the 30-member Senate seems mostly on the same page on the issue, Kirkbride said it feels to him like the 60-member House is more divided. 
The Legislature’s Management Council, which includes House and Senate leadership, could direct the Judiciary Committee to address the issue, but there’s been no indication that will happen. The council meets in April to make several key determinations on the course of interim months. 
Oedekoven said it’s possible a review of the matter in the courts could provide some answers or better define penalties for cannabis-infused products. Individual lawmakers could also bring a bill forward in 2019. 
“I’m hoping they’ll deal with the issue, and deal with it correctly,” Oedekoven said.

","NICOLE GRAY LANDSEM, 19, and DENNIS ROBERT GONDER, 20, have been charged in Circuit Court with possession with intent to deliver marijuana, a felony. They were arrested April 16 after an anonymous caller to the Crime Stoppers tip line reported there was “a large amount of marijuana inside apartment #8” at 3506 Foothills Blvd., according to court documents. A police officer and his drug dog went to the apartments and the dog indicated drugs were present in apartment 8 after showing no interest in three other apartments. Gonder responded to the officer’s knock and the officer “could smell the overwhelming odor of raw marijuana,” according to an affidavit. After getting a search warrant, the officer found 7.5 ounces of marijuana concealed in a closet in the living room. Landsem said Gonder had gone to Colorado to buy the marijuana. Gonder said the only marijuana he knew about was shake on a couch cushion. Also in the apartment, police found 0.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms in the kitchen and 0.2 grams of LSD in Landsem’s bedroom, according to court documents. Both also are charged with misdemeanor counts of possession of a controlled substance for psilocybin mushrooms. Landsem also is charged with misdemeanor possession of LSD.

            Marijuana reform passes Senate
        
","Wyoming senators passed their marijuana reform bill Wednesday, which follows the House of Representatives killing its version of the bill in the Legislature’s first week. 
The Joint Judiciary Committee passed two bills during the interim, one for each chamber, attempting to reform marijuana laws to address several concerns put forth by law enforcement and courts. Wyoming lawmakers have tried and failed to address issues that have come up since Colorado began loosening laws on the drug in the last several legislative sessions. 
Products infused with cannabis, such as edibles and liquids, continue to vex policymakers in terms of what amounts constitute felonies. 
Sarah Barrett of the Wyoming State Crime Lab reported to lawmakers in November that no new advances have been made since the last session that might make it easier to discern the drug’s concentration in any particular product. This has led to some hesitancy on the part of lawmakers worried they would be voting for laws that could apply felony charges for relatively minor offenses. 
Currently, Wyoming law states possession of 3 ounces or more of marijuana in plant form is considered a felony in Wyoming. The bill would make it a felony to possess more than 36 ounces of a cannabis-infused liquid, more than 3 grams of cannabis concentrate products or more than 3 ounces of marijuana in another form. 
On Wednesday, Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, proposed an amendment that would allow defendants to contend that a product they are charged with possessing doesn’t constitute a felony based on the amount of intoxicating elements in a product, such as an edible, at their own expense. 
Sen. Leland Christensen, R-Alta, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he was against the amendment because he heard in testimony the testing wasn’t accurate enough to meet a legal standard. But Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, supported the amendment, arguing the testing is commonplace. It just hasn’t made its way into an affordable marketplace that would allow Wyoming law enforcement agencies to conduct regular testing, Rothfuss said. 
“The idea that we can’t do this when, for example, we can tell the concentration of certain gases on a star 100 million light years away — it’s absurd,” he said. 
But it wasn’t enough to convince senators to amend the bill, as it failed 13-17. The bill passed its third and final reading in the Senate 19-11. Laramie County Sens. Fred Emerich and Anthony Bouchard, both Republicans, voted “nay.” 
While the House apparently lacked the appetite to consider its own measure, it will now be up to that chamber to decide whether to pass Senate File 23.

            Powell officials find pot in city planters
        
","City of Powell workers recently discovered a different kind of “weed” sprouting up in a couple of city planters: marijuana plants. 
Powell Police Chief Roy Eckerdt suspects someone slipped marijuana seeds into the city planters some time ago. 
Amid the other plants and flowers growing in the pots, city workers unknowingly watered and cared for the cannabis plants for a period of weeks before discovering a couple on the afternoon of June 29, Eckerdt said. 
“They recognized what it was once everything started to leaf out,” he said. 
City Parks and Recreation Superintendent Del Barton said the plants were difficult for his seasonal workers to distinguish at first. 
“To be honest with you, and to be fair, without having a marijuana field testing kit, I can’t tell the difference between hemp and marijuana,” Barton said with a chuckle. “But it sure looked like marijuana to me.” 
Barton’s workers pulled the plants and took them to police. A couple days later, another plant was found, bringing the total to three plants in three different pots. 
“They [the workers] just mentioned to me this morning that in the course of watering, they think — though we’re not sure yet — that there may be some additional ones popping up,” Barton said Wednesday. 
While the chief can only speculate on the intent behind the clandestine plantings, “my guess is that’s somebody’s sense of humor,” Eckerdt said.

            Guns, God, weed and land: Survey reveals public opinion on legislative issues
        
","A new survey asked Wyomingites for their opinions on a number of hot-button issues facing the Wyoming Legislature this session — including public lands, marijuana, “stand your ground” legislation and separation of church and state. 
While many of the proposed bills relating to these issues have already failed, others are still in play, and Brian Harnisch — a senior research scientist with the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center — said the survey could provide valuable information to state lawmakers. 
“A lot of time, at the state, what we hear is anecdotal evidence about what constituents may or may not feel, so what we wanted to do is provide a tool that can actually ... say, ‘This is what the citizens of Wyoming as a whole feel about these issues,’” Harnisch said. 
While most surveys conducted by WYSAC take weeks or months to complete, the 2018 Legislative Session Survey of Wyoming Citizens was fielded in four days, gathering responses from 694 survey completions, while using an online probability-based panel of respondents called WyoSpeaks. 
Harnisch said the panel ensures everyone in Wyoming has an equal chance of being asked to participate. 
“The WyoSpeaks panel is a tool we’ve been developing for almost two years now — the idea being that we build a probability panel of Wyoming citizens to enable us to do these fast-turnaround, low-cost, web-based surveys that produce statistically valid results,” he said. 
Though the legislative-issues survey is the first publication based on the WyoSpeaks panel, WYSAC has performed “test runs” before. 
“We’ve tested the panel — against our scientifically-rigorous telephone survey results for the same questions — to make sure that we got results that were statistically valid and comparable to those really robust, scientifically rigorous methodology questions,” Harnisch said. 
He added he hopes the survey and future similar surveys will be used by state legislators to gauge public opinion. Given the quick turnaround time and low cost of WyoSpeaks panel survey, Harnisch said the survey could be deployed more frequently and maybe even multiple times throughout the year. 
“As we develop this — this is still in its infancy — I’d like to have more of a partnership with the Legislature,” he said. “(If) we know about some issues that might be coming up, we can actually get a bit of a head start and try to get this information out to the Legislature as a service to them to make sure they’re informed about what the citizens of the state actually feel about the issues.” 
Public lands 
The survey found Wyoming residents were divided on issues related to the transfer of public lands, with 43 percent saying they support the transfer of federal lands to the state and 41 percent saying they oppose. There was a similar split on whether the state could financially handle the management of land being transferred. 
However, a majority of residents — 71 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to raise revenue for the management of remaining lands, and an even greater majority — 76 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to reduce budget deficits. 
More than half — 55 percent — agree the state could do a better job of managing public lands in Wyoming than the federal government. 
A plurality — 47 percent — said they would support an amendment clarifying how the state would handle public lands transferred from federal to state control. House Bill 131 — which speaks to this issue — failed introduction Feb. 14. 
Marijuana 
A majority of residents — 70 percent — support medical marijuana and oppose jail time for minor possession convictions, but residents are divided on issues of recreational marijuana, according to the study. 
A plurality — 49 percent — said they oppose allowing adults to legally possess marijuana for personal use, while 43 percent support it. 
A proposed house bill seeking to establish penalties for edible marijuana products failed introduction one day before the survey period began, but a senate file providing for similar penalties has passed the Senate and been referred to committee in the House. 
The survey finds residents are divided on the issue, with 33 percent saying they support a bill with such penalties but 37 saying they oppose such a bill. 
‘Stand your ground’ 
Senate File 71, which would introduce “stand your ground” legislation to state statute, has considerable support in the Legislature. Sponsored by Sen. Anthony Bouchard, R-Cheyenne, the bill has 22 co-sponsors. 
The bill also has support from a majority — 62 percent — of residents, according to the study. Senate File 71 was passed by the Senate Wednesday and referred to committee in the House the next day. 
Cryptocurrency 
House Bill 70 — which would enable blockchain token, or cryptocurrency, trading in Wyoming — has citizens divided, with 18 percent saying they support it and 29 percent saying they oppose it, and more than half refusing to take a side — 28 percent of survey respondents say they neither support nor oppose it, while 25 percent say they don’t know or are not sure. 
The bill was passed unanimously by the House and passed second reading in the Senate on Thursday. 
‘In God We Trust’ 
A proposed bill requiring classrooms, school libraries, the state capitol building and other state-owned or leased buildings to display “In God We Trust” passed in the House and has been referred to committee in the Senate. A majority of Wyoming residents — 54 percent — said they support the bill, while 30 percent said they oppose it. 
Stalking laws 
House Bill 8 — which would increase the punishments for stalking and was passed by both chambers — is supported by 83 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study. 
Taxes 
The study polled respondents on a number of tax proposals brought before the State Legislature this session, though the most popular bills are already dead. 
A majority of Wyoming residents — 71 percent — said they support increasing the cigarette tax, while 70 percent supported increasing the tax on moist snuff. A bill doing both failed introduction Feb. 16, the day the survey began. 
A bill increasing the tax on alcohol — supported by 64 percent of Wyoming residents — similarly failed introduction. The Legislature also killed a statewide lodging tax supported by a majority — 53 percent — of Wyoming residents. 
A wind energy production tax hike, which divided residents, is also dead. While 40 percent of respondents said they support the bill, 34 percent said they oppose it. 
A tax cut for the oil and gas industry — which is supported by 51 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study — is still alive, having passed in the Senate and referred to committee in the House.

Quincy-based Ermont Inc. has been selling cannabis-infused pizza for about three weeks to rave reviews. 
Director of Operations Seth Yaffe says the company has a whole range of marijuana edibles, but he wanted to offer meals that patients could eat without a lot of sugar. 
The 6-inch cheese pizzas sell for $38 apiece. The tomato sauce contains 125 milligrams of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. The company has sold about 200 already. Yaffe says if patients want toppings, they can add their own. 
Only people with state-issued medical marijuana ID cards are eligible to buy the pies.

THERMOPOLIS – With the legalization of marijuana and marijuana-based products in neighboring Colorado, Wyoming has seen an influx of non-plant contraband, including edibles and oils, often found in candies, sodas and baked goods. 
While the state currently has no law governing the prosecution of edibles, or a definition of standard weights for prosecution, and past legislation has failed to be passed due to wording and a broad scope, the House and Senate Joint Judiciary Committee took up the topic on Thursday in Thermopolis, to hear from a wide variety of witnesses regarding future legislation which would regulate the products. 
“We are seeing things we’ve never seen before [in Powell] from candy and vaporizers to oils, which are hard to detect,” said Powell Chief of Police Roy Eckerdt, testifying before the committee. “We’re kind of being left to hold the bag while the weight of this bill [to set criminal penalties for edibles] is being debated.” 
While Chief Eckerdt noted that the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, has found to be higher in the candy and liquid form, it still does not meet the states definition of marijuana as being “a leafy plant or parts.” 
Wyoming Chief Deputy Attorney John Knepper Jr. testified that the state should determine the appropriate levels of THC for prosecution, before the federal government sets a mandate. 
“We need to dete rmine THC levels which would make possession a felony, relevant for state prosecutors to deal with it at a state level without federal intervention from the federal system,” said Knepper. “We are fortunate, however, to have a cooperative relationship with federal law enforcement, for now.” 
Byron Oedekoven, executive director for the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, noted that the state currently defines marijuana as any part of the plant, but with no way to test for THC in edibles, they don’t fall under the definition. Oedekoven recommended to the committee that the legislature first define marijuana, before trying to determine penalties for an undefined product such as edibles. 
Senator Larry Hicks (R-Baggs) suggested the committee could change the definition to include any compound derived from the plant, but warned that the danger in creating a new definition is that too many loopholes already exist on the subject. 
Frank Latta, state director for the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML), urged the committee to go slow, and not be in a rush to define penalties when loopholes already exist, creating a budget crisis in the legal system. “I don’t believe this is a public safety issue,” said Latta, noting that THC has not been proven to be toxic, as compared to opioids or other scheduled drugs. 
Representative Nathan Winters (R-Thermopolis) challenged Latta’s contention that THC is not dangerous, referencing an increase in emergency room visits in Colorado, and an increase in traffic accidents associated with drivers under the influence of marijuana. 
“No one has ever died from THC,” remarked Latta. 
“You can talk about revenue increases in Colorado all you want,” said Winters, “but Peter has been robbed to pay Paul ... as a matter of fact, he’s been flogged.” 
“We can play ping pong all day, but I don’t want to do that,” replied Latta. “The fact remains: we have seen no deaths from THC or edibles or anything else.” 
At the conclusion of public comments, Chairman Leland Christensen (R-Alta) noted that the committee has several more meetings on the topic ahead, and that there were simply too many concepts to consider, but that redefining marijuana was a good approach to further creating a set of laws to prosecute the possession of edibles. 
“Quite frankly,” said Senator Hicks, “we need a more measured approach to this.”

The Sublette County Sheriff’s Office says state and local police searched the farm on Aug. 25 on a warrant after receiving information about marijuana being grown at the site. 
The office says officers confiscated about 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) of processed marijuana, about 300 marijuana plants and more than $63,000. 
The search resulted in felony drug charges against three individuals.

360,365,WY,www.wyodaily.com,https://www.wyodaily.com/story/2015/08/06/news/city-endorses-statement-condemning-marijuana-use/263.html,Northern Wyoming Daily News - Serving the Big Horn Basin for over 100 years,"The Worland City Council approved a resolution Tuesday condemning marijuana use. 
Worland City Council members unanimously endorsed a resolution condemning the use of marijuana. 
Worland Chief of Police, Gabe Elliott told the council, at its regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday night, that the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police (WASCOP) is raising awareness of the drug in response to states legalizing marijuana. 
Colorado citizens voted to legalize marijuana during the 2012 election. 
According to information provided by WASCOP, the goal of the project is to ""inform the citizens of Wyoming as to the harmful personal and societal effects of marijuana."" 
According to a statement released by WASCOP, Wyoming residents are becoming de-sensitized and/or disbelieving of the dangers of marijuana use. Marijuana use/dependence is the No. 1 reason kids are admitted to substance abuse treatment across the nation. 
During the meeting, Elliott advised the council of the consequences of marijuana use. 
""It's a gateway drug. It's definitely harmful to our society, in my opinion,"" Elliott said. 
Elliott said, with the city's endorsement of the anti-marijuana campaign, state legislators would see that municipalities throughout Wyoming have condemned the drug. 
Councilperson Dennis Koch voted for the measure. 
""Obviously, there are going to be some people who are not going to be thrilled with us opposing marijuana, but I think it's time for communities and governments to take a stand,"" Koch said. 
At a meeting in February, law enforcement and school officials warned the community about the dangers of marijuana use. Elliott said there is a ""new generation of users"" in today's world. 
Elliott also warned about the new methods of marijuana use. 
Dabbing is ""the new form of marijuana smoking,"" according to Elliott. 
""Butane oil is used to extract the THC out of marijuana. The high is more intense; the duration is longer and we're seeing a lot of ill effects from it,"" Elliott said, adding that people don't realize how much THC they are injecting. 
Marijuana can also be ingested through dabbing, Elliott said. 
""It changes the whole game of what we're seeing these days. Now, they eat a full brownie and bad things happen,"" Elliott said. 
According to the information released by WASCOP, the negative consequences of legalization in Colorado include a 26 percent in youth (ages 12 to 17 years of age) monthly marijuana use. 
Also listed as a harm in the report, the number of pets poisoned from ingesting marijuana has increased six-fold. Traffic fatalities involving operators testing positive for marijuana have increased 100 percent in Colorado. 
The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) lobbies legislators for legalization of marijuana for both medical and recreational use. 
Wyoming Chapter Director Chris Christian called WASCOP's report false. 
""It is nothing but false-faced propaganda with no supporting evidence presented,"" she said, citing the claim marijuana use has increased 26 percent by youth. 
""This is directly in contradiction to every published report there is. I want to know where they got this data, and I want to see it. This is unsupported hearsay. I'm way pissed off about the way they're going about doing this,"" Christian said. 
The report also delves into the ways marijuana is consumed. 
""Marijuana is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints) or in pipes or water pipes (bongs). It is also smoked in blunts – cigars that have been emptied of tobacco and refilled with a mixture of marijuana and tobacco. 
""Marijuana is associated with a higher likelihood of dropping out of school. Several studies also associate workers' marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers' compensation claims and job turnover.""

361,366,WY,www.wyodaily.com,https://www.wyodaily.com/story/2018/03/06/news/survey-reveals-public-opinion-on-wyoming-legislative-issues/6623.html,Northern Wyoming Daily News - Serving the Big Horn Basin for over 100 years,"A new survey asked Wyomingites for their opinions on a number of hot-button issues facing the Wyoming Legislature this session — including public lands, marijuana, “stand your ground” legislation and separation of church and state. 
LARAMIE — A new survey asked Wyomingites for their opinions on a number of hot-button issues facing the Wyoming Legislature this session — including public lands, marijuana, “stand your ground” legislation and separation of church and state. 
While many of the proposed bills relating to these issues have already failed, others are still in play, and Brian Harnisch — a senior research scientist with the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center — said the survey could provide valuable information to state lawmakers. 
“A lot of time, at the state, what we hear is anecdotal evidence about what constituents may or may not feel, so what we wanted to do is provide a tool that can actually ... say, ‘This is what the citizens of Wyoming as a whole feel about these issues,’” Harnisch said. 
While most surveys conducted by WYSAC take weeks or months to complete, the 2018 Legislative Session Survey of Wyoming Citizens was fielded in four days, gathering responses from 694 survey completions, while using an online probability-based panel of respondents called WyoSpeaks. 
Harnisch said the panel ensures everyone in Wyoming has an equal chance of being asked to participate. 
“The WyoSpeaks panel is a tool we’ve been developing for almost two years now — the idea being that we build a probability panel of Wyoming citizens to enable us to do these fast-turnaround, low-cost, web-based surveys that produce statistically valid results,” he said. 
Though the legislative-issues survey is the first publication based on the WyoSpeaks panel, WYSAC has performed “test runs” before. 
“We’ve tested the panel — against our scientifically-rigorous telephone survey results for the same questions — to make sure that we got results that were statistically valid and comparable to those really robust, scientifically rigorous methodology questions,” Harnisch said. 
He added he hopes the survey and future similar surveys will be used by state legislators to gauge public opinion. Given the quick turnaround time and low cost of WyoSpeaks panel survey, Harnisch said the survey could be deployed more frequently and maybe even multiple times throughout the year. 
“As we develop this — this is still in its infancy — I’d like to have more of a partnership with the Legislature,” he said. “(If) we know about some issues that might be coming up, we can actually get a bit of a head start and try to get this information out to the Legislature as a service to them to make sure they’re informed about what the citizens of the state actually feel about the issues.” 
Public lands 
The survey found Wyoming residents were divided on issues related to the transfer of public lands, with 43 percent saying they support the transfer of federal lands to the state and 41 percent saying they oppose. There was a similar split on whether the state could financially handle the management of land being transferred. 
However, a majority of residents — 71 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to raise revenue for the management of remaining lands, and an even greater majority — 76 percent — said they oppose the state selling off public lands to reduce budget deficits. 
More than half — 55 percent — agree the state could do a better job of managing public lands in Wyoming than the federal government. 
A plurality — 47 percent — said they would support an amendment clarifying how the state would handle public lands transferred from federal to state control. House Bill 131 — which speaks to this issue — failed introduction Feb. 14. 
Marijuana 
A majority of residents — 70 percent — support medical marijuana and oppose jail time for minor possession convictions, but residents are divided on issues of recreational marijuana, according to the study. 
A plurality — 49 percent — said they oppose allowing adults to legally possess marijuana for personal use, while 43 percent support it. 
A proposed house bill seeking to establish penalties for edible marijuana products failed introduction one day before the survey period began, but a senate file providing for similar penalties has passed the Senate and been referred to committee in the House. 
The survey finds residents are divided on the issue, with 33 percent saying they support a bill with such penalties but 37 saying they oppose such a bill. 
‘Stand your ground’ 
Senate File 71, which would introduce “stand your ground” legislation to state statute, has considerable support in the Legislature. Sponsored by Sen. Anthony Bouchard, R-Cheyenne, the bill has 22 co-sponsors. 
The bill also has support from a majority — 62 percent — of residents, according to the study. Senate File 71 was passed by the Senate Wednesday and referred to committee in the House the next day. 
Cryptocurrency 
House Bill 70 — which would enable blockchain token, or cryptocurrency, trading in Wyoming — has citizens divided, with 18 percent saying they support it and 29 percent saying they oppose it, and more than half refusing to take a side — 28 percent of survey respondents say they neither support nor oppose it, while 25 percent say they don’t know or are not sure. 
The bill was passed unanimously by the House and passed second reading in the Senate on Thursday. 
‘In God We Trust’ 
A proposed bill requiring classrooms, school libraries, the state capitol building and other state-owned or leased buildings to display “In God We Trust” passed in the House and has been referred to committee in the Senate. A majority of Wyoming residents — 54 percent — said they support the bill, while 30 percent said they oppose it. 
Stalking laws 
House Bill 8 — which would increase the punishments for stalking and was passed by both chambers — is supported by 83 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study. 
Taxes 
The study polled respondents on a number of tax proposals brought before the State Legislature this session, though the most popular bills are already dead. 
A majority of Wyoming residents — 71 percent — said they support increasing the cigarette tax, while 70 percent supported increasing the tax on moist snuff. A bill doing both failed introduction Feb. 16, the day the survey began. 
A bill increasing the tax on alcohol — supported by 64 percent of Wyoming residents — similarly failed introduction. The Legislature also killed a statewide lodging tax supported by a majority — 53 percent — of Wyoming residents. 
A wind energy production tax hike, which divided residents, is also dead. While 40 percent of respondents said they support the bill, 34 percent said they oppose it. 
A tax cut for the oil and gas industry — which is supported by 51 percent of Wyoming residents, according to the study — is still alive, having passed in the Senate and referred to committee in the House.

            Traffic stops net hundreds of pounds of marijuana
        
","The Wyoming Highway Patrol recently conducted a massive crackdown on drug trafficking along the Interstate 80 corridor. Drug traffickers routinely move product across the state and into other states along the corridor, according to WHP Lt. Bob Garner. 
During the past week, the Highway Patrol made multiple drug arrests and seized large amounts of marijuana within Carbon County. 
The Carbon County initiative was led by the Highway Patrol with assistance from other units from across the state. On Oct. 5, the WHP stopped a vehicle from Pennsylvania carrying 190 pounds of marijuana. 
“This was a concentrated effort from units around the state,” Garner said. 
Trooper Joshua Carris stopped the car because he noticed multiple duffel bags in the car, causing him to become suspicious, believing the bags were carrying large amounts of marijuana. When Carris approached the male driver, he claimed he was there to visit his son, but he named three different places his son lived. Carris said the male admitted that he was carrying the drugs and was making $200 per pound of marijuana. The two individuals are now facing felony charges for possession of marijuana and conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance. A special K-9 unit was called in for this operation. During the week-long bust, seven individuals were arrested from out of state. All those arrested are still waiting to be arraigned in district court.

            Traffic stop leads to 48 pounds of marijuana
        
","An Indiana couple was arrested earlier this week after a traffic stop led Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers to a discovery of 48 pounds of marijuana. 
Michael Ellet, 59, and Monica Milliner, 24, of Marion, Ind., each face charges of felony possession of marijuana, possession with intent to deliver marijuana and conspiracy to deliver marijuana. The maximum penalty is 25 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Court documents show that Milliner is being held on a $25,000 cash bond, but similar documents for Ellet were not immediately available. 
According to a Carbon County Sheriff’s Department affidavit, WHP Trooper David Chatfield pulled over the couple’s vehicle on Interstate 80 near milepost 235 for traveling 78 mph in a 75 mph zone at around 9:05 p.m. Monday. Chatfield, upon stopping the vehicle, requested identification from the driver, Ellet, who “appeared to not be paying attention.” 
Chatfield had Ellet come to his vehicle, and while speaking with him and saying he’d be issuing a warning, “detected an odor of marijuana” on Ellet. Ellet said he “has never used marijuana and did not know what Trooper Chatfield was talking about.” 
Chatfield, the affidavit stated, “kept the conversation going” and learned from Ellet that he and his girlfriend, Milliner, had traveled to Portland, Ore., to attend Ellet’s nephew’s wedding. However, Ellet was unable to tell Chatfield exactly when the wedding was. 
Chatfield said he’d talk with the passenger, Milliner, who said they’d traveled to Salem, Ore., to visit Ellet’s family. She said there was no special occasion or event that happened while there. 
The trooper told Ellet he’d be deploying his K-9, Buster, on the vehicle, who “alerted to the exterior.” Chatfield searched the vehicle and “located a large amount of marijuana in the trunk.” 
The vehicle was towed by Jack’s Body and Fender to the Rawlins Wyoming Department of Transportation Building, where items within were seized. 
Those items included, according to the affidavit, two duffle bags containing 24 packages of marijuana and three package of THC edibles, each estimated to weigh 24 pounds. 
Four credit cards, a white pill bottle containing a “small amount of marijuana,” a small plastic bag of THC edibles, two cell phones and “miscellaneous paperwork” were also seized. 
According to the affidavit, Milliner “indicated” that she was paid $1,000 to go on the trip “to transport the marijuana and assist with the driving” during an interview with police. She also said there were “text messages from different individuals requesting ’20 sacks’ of marijuana on the seized cell phones. 
Ellet, in his interview with police, said he purchased the marijuana for $2,300 per pound and intended to resale the drug in Indiana for $3,000 to $4,000 per pound.

            Steinfeldt sentenced to 13-20 years in prison
        
","There were two Bobbi Steinfeldts presented to the court during her sentencing Tuesday morning. 
One Bobbi Steinfeldt was a hard-working mother of six, a former addict and a success story of sobriety who had achieved 15 years of clean living before fate and misfortune dealt her a wrong hand, and opened her up to resuming drug abuse. 
The other Bobbi Steinfeldt was the kingpin of a massive criminal conspiracy that had distributed methamphetamine in copious amounts to multiple counties and over state lines. 
It was the second Steinfeldt that Carbon County District Court Judge Wade Waldrip sentenced Tuesday morning to 13-20 years incarceration for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, with 2-5 years to be served concurrently for marijuana possession. 
Describing Steinfeldt as a “purveyor of meth,” Waldrip heard out the defense’s impassioned plea for mercy on her client’s behalf. Jamie Woolsey emphasized that Steinfeldt wasn’t just a defendant, but she was also a mother, a daughter, a member of a family. 
“All defendants who come before this court (are) somebody’s mother, daughter...and all defendants deserve the mercy of this court,” Waldrip said. 
He then said that Steinfeldt had enjoyed that mercy, and the presumption of innocence until her conviction, but that her crimes had harmful impacts on the lives of people in multiple Wyoming counties. 
County Prosecutor Cal Rerucha was similarly unmoved by the defense’s continued assertions of Steinfeldt’s personal virtues and familial focus. 
“This isn’t a person who just uses drugs,” Rerucha said, having spent much of the over two-hour long sentencing hearing going through the long list of conspirators and drug runners who had been arrested and sentenced in connection to Steinfeldt’s drug operations. 
“She went on a rampage that ruined dozens of lives. You have seen the level of misery this person has caused...she makes a lot of excuses, but ignores the lives she has ruined,” he said. 
Steinfeldt was joined in the courtroom by her family, a collection of her sons and relatives, some of who spoke to the quality of her character. Her son, Jonathan Jolly, came up to the podium to talk of his mother’s strength. 
“She tried to raise six boys alone. She is a strong woman. She isn’t (this) type of person,” Jolly said. “She fell, but she can get back up. I ask from the bottom of my heart that you not give up hope in her.” 
Steinfeldt had a statement prepared that she read aloud, pausing from time to time as her emotions caused her voice to break, and visibly crying as she made her way through the statement. 
She spoke to much of the same story her defense had been emphasizing: that she had been a former addict, had worked her way back to sobriety and supported six children on her own. Facing the death of a grandchild, a home devoid of children, and the extreme physical disability and pain left behind from a vehicular crash involving a semi-truck, Steinfeldt said she found herself hopped up on opiates, in constant pain and that opened her up to a relapse. 
“I thank God and everyone here today for these 15 months of sobriety,” she said. 
Steinfeldt’s defense passed around a photograph of Steinfeldt and her family, for the Court’s consideration. 
The length of the hearing was largely spent going over an enormous chart that detailed the various persons who were involved with Steinfeldt’s organization, many of whom were also serving sizable sentences, while about nine from Carbon County had been granted probations in exchange for testimony. Several of those who had been sentenced to probation had since violated those probation terms. 
“This is a somber day in my life,” Steinfeldt said. “I apologize to each and every member of my family.” 
She paused to turned back and look at her family, seated behind her, before continuing. “...and to the community. Even though I am being tried for my crime, I am being enlightened as well.”

            Medical marijuana will not be on 2018 ballot
        
","Tuesday marked the deadline for the Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws to submit their signatures to place a medical marijuana act on 2018’s ballot. 
“What I can tell you is that Wyoming NORML, while the committee did not ...turn the petitions in, we are not going away,” Carrie Satterwhite, secretary for Wyoming NORML, said in a phone interview Friday. “We are going to continue on. We are not going to quit until these patients can get the treatment they need.” 
Wyoming’s chapter of NORML had been working to acquire a requisite 25,673 signatures in order to place the Peggy A. Kelley Wyoming Cannabis Act of 2016 onto the 2018 General Election Ballot. According to a release by the Secretary of State’s Office, the signatures required to be placed on the ballot had to equal at least 15 percent of the total number of votes cast in the 2014 general election. Those signatures were required to be obtained proportionally from 15 percent of resident voters in at least 16 of Wyoming’s 23 counties. 
The Peggy A. Kelly Wyoming Cannabis Act would provide for the lawful acquisition, growth, cultivation, extraction, production, distribution, retail sales, licensing and taxation of medical marijuana and infused products. The act would also make it legal to cultivate and produce hemp and hemp products for commercial use and research. 
NORML has faced strong resistance from anti-drug and law enforcement groups, resistance Satterwhite said is born from a want of federal funding. 
“I don’t see the resistance (to legalization in Wyoming) softening,” Satterwhite said. “(Law enforcement’s) bread and butter comes from federal funding. Law enforcement gets federal money for the War on Drugs. As long as they keep their drug bust numbers high, and marijuana is an easy target, and say ‘look at all the drug busts we’ve got!’ they keep getting the federal funding.” 
Satterwhite said NORML is going to continue to try and soften the adverse effects of the drug war through legislative reforms, supporting bills and laws that would ease punishments for non-violent drug offenders. Satterwhite said it would be nice to try and fight for a place on the 2020 ballot, but that the group is currently in the process of planning and changing their goals. 
“We’re in the process of talking about fundraising because it is not cheap,” Satterwhite said. “We are more of a grassroots organization, we don’t have a lot of funding.”

            Governor hopeful Sam Galeotos addresses campaign platform in Rawlins
        
","Gubernatorial candidate Sam Galeotos (R-Cheyenne) looks to continue recent actions of the state in areas of budgets and the state penitentiary if elected. 
Meeting Carbon County residents at Econo Lodge Monday evening, Galeotos addressed the state prison, education, marijuana usage and healthcare. 
With state penitentiary questions still lingering, Galeotos said he would prefer to continue repairs on the current facility. 
“The legislative committee that was working on that made certain recommendations,” he said. “I think there are a lot of great people on that committee from architects to everybody else that worked on that. I think their recommendation needs to be given serious consideration.” 
Hitting on the increase of inmates, Galeotos questioned if the state needs to look into its sentencing and if changes are necessary. 
“Are there people that really don’t need to go (to the penitentiary), that need to be diverted to something else that already exists?” he asked. “The funding will be in the hands of the legislature, but sometimes having to go to the penitentiary is an extra sentence on life that doesn’t need to go there.” 
Galeotos added the state needs to develop a program for inmates to help them exit the penitentiary in a positive way. 
Switching to concerns with the education budget, Galeotos said the next governor needs to continue the spending studies currently in place to help the state determine where wasteful spending is taking place. 
“Last year the legislature had an efficiency study that they commissioned, where they looked at four agencies in the state and determined that there was roughly, give or take, around $2 million of opportunity for us to either improve for collection of revenue or cut back wasteful funding,” he said. “That is pretty significant to the state.” 
Galeotos said the state has another study that’s going on that could yield another $2million of potential opportunities. 
Galeotos further said the state’s short-term needs must focus on accelerating both industry and tourism to generate funds. 
Galeotos explained that people in the mining, oil and gas industries across the state have additional areas holding them back. 
“They believe they could be producing more if it were not for some of the red tape and everything that exists both at the federal level and at the state level,” he said. “I think, first and foremost, we need to look at how can we unshackle those industries to produce more.” 
Touching on the use of marijuana, Galeotos said he feels the state should allow medical usage. Galeotos explained that his brother’s secondary progressive multiple sclerosis could possibly be helped through prescribed medical marijuana. 
“Why would we not allow that for people, when it’s proven to be beneficial?” he asked. 
Galeotos said while there are still a lot of questions to be answered about recreational use, the state needs to address the penalties given to young adults who use it so as it doesn’t hang over them their entire life. 
Wrapping up with healthcare, Galeotos said the state needs to allow groups of people to join together for healthcare insurance and allow individuals to go across state lines for healthcare insurance. 
Galeotos, looking to the future, said he would like to see Wyoming lead the development of service delivery such as telemedicine and telediagnostics. 
“I think by focusing on that, and getting private enterprise to come in and focus on those things here, we can not only solve our own problems but we can lead in the innovation of the solutions— which then can go on and create jobs for us and our young people and everything else in that industry,” he said.

            Wyoming State Senate candidates
        
","Editor’s note: These questions/answers from political candidates running for state positions were supposed to be printed in Wednesday’s election guide; however, they were cut off. 
Senators serve four-year terms in the upper house of the Wyoming legislature, without term limits. Stipends are $150 per day during the legislative session or for committee meetings—the stipend includes travel days. Per Diem expenses are allowed at maximum rate of $109, less when the meeting is in their community. There are three different Senate Districts in Albany County; SD 9 encompasses some of the county around Laramie. SD 10 includes another portion of Laramie and the rest of the county except a portion of western Albany County including the town of Rock River, which is part of SD 11 that includes Carbon County. Candidates are listed below grouped by district. Voters may call the Albany County Clerk at 307 721-2541 to request their district number, or find it on their “elections” web site. The Senator for SD 10, Glen Moniz (R) is not up for reelection this year. Voters only choose from the candidates for the District in which they live; candidates must live in the District also. No Republican filed for SD 9. 
What experience, qualifications and interests do you have that would encourage voters to select you for this office? 
Chris Rothfuss (D-SD 9): I have served in the WY Senate since 2011, including the past six years as Senate Minority Leader. I am a member of the Education Committee, the Minerals Business and Economic Development Committee and numerous other select committees and task forces. Outside of the legislature, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor for the UW Honors College and an advanced technology consultant. I received a BA in international studies and an MS in chemical engineering from the University of Wyoming; and an MS in applied physics and a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Washington. [www.linkedin.com/in/rothfuss/] 
Larry Hicks (R-SD 11): Education: B.S. University of Wyoming, M.S. Montana State University, Doctoral work @ UW. Twenty-eight years’ experience in natural resource management working with federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Landowners on the management and regulation of natural resource in Wyoming. Served on local and national boards related to water, agriculture, and natural resources. Eight years in the Wyoming Senate, including Chairmen of the Agriculture-Public Lands and Water Resources, and Select Natural Resource Funding. Also served on Judiciary, Corporation- Election-Political Subdivision Committee and Select Water. Represent Wyoming Legislature on national committees for Agriculture, Water Resource and Infrastructure, and Environment. 
Lee Ann Stephenson (D-SD 11): I graduated from the University of Wyoming with a bachelor degree in Administration of Justice in 1989. While living in Cheyenne, I worked for the Department of Family Services investigating child abuse. I was promoted to the DFS state office to provide training, rules, procedures, office audits for the child protection division, including work on legislation for child protection and welfare reform. I next moved to the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, as a program manager for domestic violence in the Division of Victim Services, also working with the legislature on laws concerning domestic violence. Retired in 2007, moved to Riverside. 
What do you advocate for solving the problem of substandard prison facilities, overcrowding and lack of rehabilitation programs in Wyoming? 
Chris Rothfuss (D-SD 9): We don’t need more prison space, we need fewer prisoners. As the expression goes, “there are two types of people in prison: those we’re afraid of, and those we’re mad at.” Sensible criminal justice reform legislation should be our first priority to reduce the number of prisoners that we’re just mad at. In particular, we should pursue alternatives to incarceration and enhanced substance abuse / treatment programs, decriminalize marijuana possession, restore funding for prison rehabilitation programs, and reduce criminal sentences for many non-violent crimes. I strongly oppose prison privatization and exporting prisoners to other states. 
Larry Hicks (R-SD 11): Wyoming does not have substandard prison! While we are currently getting close to capacity we still have shuttered space at the medium correctional facility in Torrington. Also, the Wyoming legislature has taken a hard look the last three years at criminal justice reform and sentencing guidelines. In the last session initial efforts were passed by the legislature to begin some of those reforms. Your statement is wrong, in studies conducted by PEW charitable trust Wyoming ranked as one of the best in the nation for low recidivism rates. That is only possible because of the successful programs delivered by the Department of Corrections. 
Lee Ann Stephenson (D-SD 11): I would like to work with the legislature on criminal justice reform. Substance abuse, addiction and mental health is often the base causes for incarceration and our growing prison population. Treatment options need to be made available at each stage of involvement in the criminal justice system. Diversion and drug courts that include close supervision by the court hold promise. 
What revenue enhancing measures, including but not limited to a state income tax, will you support in the 2019 Legislative session? 
Chris Rothfuss (D-SD 9): We will not diversify the WY economy away from our reliance on the mineral industry without concurrently diversifying our state tax structure. Earlier this year, I sponsored ‘Tax Reform 2020’ legislation to assemble a Select Committee that would look ahead to a series of hypothetical future Wyomings, each with diversified economies, and propose an appropriately balanced, fair and equitable tax system. I also joined Rep. Connolly in co-sponsoring ‘Comprehensive tax reform’ legislation that would modernize nearly all of our state and local taxes while adding very progressive personal and corporate income taxes. Everything should be on the table. 
Larry Hicks (R-SD 11): I will not support a state income tax!!! Your assumption is that we have a revenue problem instead of a spending problem! The revenue generating measure I do support are regulatory reforms, low tax policies that attract private sector business investment, pursuing value added economic strategies to our existing industries that provide both jobs and opportunities for Wyoming people. 
Lee Ann Stephenson (D-SD 11): No one wants to pay more taxes. First, I want to make sure we have all the tools in place to make sure we are correctly collecting all the taxes currently legislated. Next, I would like to look at all the tax exemptions currently granted and evaluate if they should still be supported. I would like to work with the legislators in creative solutions, particularly in school financing. I do not feel we can cut school financing any further. I would like to focus finances on our students and teachers over building new school buildings.

            Restoring voting rights
        
","Voting, who gets to do so and under what conditions, is a State issue. A lot of people are surprised to learn that. The first thing that comes to most people’s minds on the issue is The Voting Rights Act of 1965. This was a Federal law passed to force states to follow the 15th Amendment of the Constitution, which says in part that states are prohibited from denying a male citizen the right to vote based on “race, color or previous condition of servitude.” 
States get to set most of the rules on voting. Here in Wyoming our voting is generally a very open process. It is easy to register, we have absentee (vote by mail) balloting which is easy to use, you can register on the date of the election and still vote, there are multiple voting places and the hours are long. 
There is one group of citizens in Wyoming who are disenfranchised, however. That group is the State’s convicted felons. Things are better now after the passage of a bill in 2017 that automatically restores the voting rights of first time, non-violent offenders upon completion of their sentence. This only applies to those convicted after Jan. 1, 2010. And it still leaves a number of ex-felons in limbo. 
The process for someone who does not fit into the new law’s guidelines can be quite complex and time consuming and can also be arbitrary. You need to have completed your sentence somewhere between five and 10 years ago. You need to apply to the Governor. If your crime involves sex or children you will not even be heard. If you still soldier on the odds are against you. The last numbers I found were from 2003 to 2011. A total of 22 pardons and 28 restorations of rights were granted, which is about 25 percent of the total reviewed. From what little I found it appears all those numbers are down for the past eight years. 
There are various arguments for and against giving felons back their civil rights. Two states – Maine and Vermont – never take those rights away. Even inmates serving life sentences still have their right to vote and to engage in civil discussions. In 14 states and the District of Columbia, rights are automatically restored upon the completion of the sentence. In 21 states, felons lose their rights while incarcerated and for some period of time afterward, then they are restored. In 13 states, the rights are lost indefinitely or require a governor’s pardon. Wyoming is one of the 13. 
This is a big issue. There are about six million people who have lost their right to vote nationally. Only a quarter are incarcerated, half have completed their sentences and the rest are on probation or parole. That is a lot of people with no voice in their governance. 
For those who oppose restoration, the argument is that one shouldn’t have a voice in making law if you can’t obey the law. Another argument is that the incarcerated lose their ability to enter into contracts, to determine their living conditions, to move. They are treated as wards of the State, and are deemed incapable of making informed decisions. Both of these stances work best when dealing with those who are in prison, and can even be stretched to cover those on probation or parole. I don’t see either as being compelling for anyone who has completed their sentence. 
Those who recommend restoration of rights say felons who have paid their debt to society should regain the right to vote. Casting a ballot is one way to positively contribute to society. It also helps overcome feelings of helplessness. Being a felon makes it much harder to get a job. Frequently families have grown apart, so support is weak. Voting, feeling like part of the community, can help give a needed sense of worth and belonging. 
While I understand the argument to take away rights, and even agree with that point of view for those still serving a sentence, I think both the inmate and society would be best served if voting rights were restored upon completion of sentence. The act that was passed for first time, non-violent offenders is a good start, but should be broadened to cover every inmate upon completion of sentence. 
The way the law is applied currently is arbitrary and unfair. If your daughter gets caught with two baggies of marijuana in her possession, one for each of her besties, she is eligible for restoration. If your son gets caught with one baggie on Tuesday and one baggie on Thursday, both for his best bud, he’s not eligible. If you serve 25 years for robbery why should you have to wait another 10 years before you can even apply for a commutation? And have, at best, a 25 percent chance of success? 
I see our current law as a violation of the 15th Amendment. It is definitely a violation of its spirit. Being tough on crime should not equal adding conditions that increase the punishment. This is an issue I hope our legislators will revisit. Ask your candidates where they stand on this. For the rest of us, take advantage of the rights we have. Study the issues, know what the effects will be. Vote at every opportunity. Because you never know when your class of citizen will find themselves on the outside looking in.
