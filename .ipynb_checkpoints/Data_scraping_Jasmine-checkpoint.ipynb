Some applicants with heavyweight backers didn't get a medical marijuana permit, while others without pedigreed recommendations won dispensing authority.Still, the letters offer a glimpse into the ways politicians weigh in on high-profile regulatory issues behind the scenes and how business leaders think those relationships can be beneficial.The highest-profile endorsement came from U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, who offered his backing to Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies for a permit in the Lafayette region. The company also had letters of support from Attorney General Jeff Landry, House Speaker Taylor Barras and Lafayette Mayor-President Joel Robideaux, among others.\"I can say with confidence that Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies has the knowledge and experience to operate a medical marijuana pharmacy that is above reproach and compliant with all state rules and regulations,\" Barras wrote.Robideaux also wrote a letter of recommendation for competing applicant The Apothecary Shoppe. Landry wrote a \"character reference\" to support a doctor involved in two medical marijuana proposals, for Acadiana Therapeutic Remedies and Calcasieu Therapeutics in Lake Charles.Landry wrote that the doctor, J. Kevin Duplechain, \"has been a trusted caretaker for several of my family members. Additionally, he has been a loyal friend and someone I can rely upon for sage advice.\"Neither of the Landry-backed applications was selected for a dispensing permit.Though it won't be located in his area, West Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Mike Cazes gave his backing to Hope Pharmacy for a northwest Louisiana-based permit. Cazes wrote that he's known co-owner and commissioned sheriff's deputy Chris Whittington for two decades.\"I have been in law enforcement my entire life, and I am confident that if Mr. Whittington observes any improprieties whatsoever in the medical marijuana industry in general, and the pharmacy in particular, he will take all steps necessary to immediately correct it,\" Cazes wrote.Hope Pharmacy was selected for the permit.Medical marijuana is expected to be available to Louisiana patients in the fall, after years of start-up work.Under a law passed in 2015 and tweaked twice since then, Louisiana is allowing therapeutic cannabis to treat a long list of diseases and disorders, such as cancer, epilepsy, intractable pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson's disease. Marijuana can be available in medicinal oils, pills, liquids, sprays and topical applications, but cannot be sold in a form to be smoked.Only the agricultural centers at LSU and Southern University are allowed to grow the product. LSU estimates its vendor will have the first medical marijuana products available within months.By capping the number of dispensing pharmacies at 10, lawmakers placed a premium on permits.

      "The biggest problem with an effort by Tuscaloosa leaders to relax penalties for marijuana possession is that it makes entirely too much sense. Well, that, and the fact that Tuscaloosa leaders don’t have home rule and can’t make such a change without the Legislature voting to approve it. That means it would be needlessly politicized with the usual banter of misinformation that often stymies any effort for sensible change in our state.Last Thursday, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox and the City Council hosted state lawmakers from West Alabama for an annual breakfast that traditionally happens shortly before the legislators begin a session.One of the topics discussed was the problem Tuscaloosa has with jail overcrowding. This city is not alone in that. It is a problem throughout the state, but here locally it is at a crisis level. The mayor noted that the criminal justice system is overwhelmed. A huge contributing factor in that problem is that in Alabama if you’re caught with even a small amount of marijuana, state law says you’ve got to be locked up.More than half the nation has legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, 29 states so far. Seven states, and Washington, D.C., have legalized it for recreational use. A number of states have decriminalized the possession of a small amount of cannabis. Cities in neighboring states, such as Nashville, Memphis and Atlanta, have relaxed laws so that possession of a small amount is still illegal but there’s a fine instead of jail time.But here in Alabama, where our prisons are so overcrowded the federal government is threatening to step in and take them over, we still lock people up for small amounts of weed. As a result, valuable resources are spent on an effort that actually makes our streets less safe.“We don’t need to be tying officers up on this,” Maddox said, explaining that the effort to arrest and jail someone isn’t worth the effort, time and money. “We need to deal with this in a different pattern besides throwing someone in jail.”Most states where marijuana is still illegal have found it much more effective to have police just confiscate the marijuana and write a ticket. It’s been that way a few miles down the road in Mississippi for many years, where the first offense for up to 30 grams, or a little more than an ounce, is a $250 fine. Actually, Mississippi decriminalized small amounts way back in 1978.The city’s proposal wouldn’t legalize weed. It wouldn’t make it more prevalent. It wouldn’t lead to more drug use. It wouldn’t even change the penalties associated with a misdemeanor charge of possession.All it would do would be to free up hours of police officers’ shifts so they could spend time enforcing other laws, free up jail space and otherwise help prevent the waste and misuse of valuable resources.It’s a good idea and like many other good ideas, it is likely to get drowned out by half-truths and rhetoric in Alabama.\n",

      "Tuscaloosa city leaders are seeking help from state legislators on a number of topics, from protecting Lake Tuscaloosa to shoring up losses in sales tax collections.The city also is pushing to relax the penalties associated with possessing small amounts of marijuana.The council hosts a breakfast for the area's members of the Alabama Legislature each year before the legislative session begins.During the Tuscaloosa City Council’s Legislative Breakfast on Thursday, Mayor Walt Maddox, City Attorney Glenda Webb and others highlighted several issues that are facing City Hall. Among them is the requirement that anyone caught with marijuana, no matter how small an amount, must be arrested and booked into jail.That takes up a lot of hours and bedspace in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, both of which could be used toward more serious matters, Maddox said.“With the collapse of the corrections system and mental health, our criminal justice system is overwhelmed,” Maddox said. “We don’t need to be tying officers up on this. ... We need to deal with this in a different pattern besides throwing someone in jail.”“This allows us to do that, to focus on other crimes to continue to make Tuscaloosa safe.”Maddox and the City Council are not pushing to decriminalize the substance. In fact, none of the penalties associated with the misdemeanor possession of marijuana would be altered.Rather, the city is seeking a change in how police must deal with those who are found with relatively small amounts of the drug. And Maddox said he’s willing to allow the Legislature to decide how little of an amount would qualify for the citation.About six of the state House of Representative and Senate members who represent portions of Tuscaloosa were in attendance for the breakfast, which the City Council hosts prior to the start of each session of the Alabama Legislature.The 2018 session begins Jan. 9 – the second Tuesday in January – because this is the final year of the quadrennial, or four-year term of the elected delegation.It begins earlier in the fourth year to allow legislators time to complete the session and return home to campaign for an additional term.This year’s breakfast was sparsely attended by the Tuscaloosa delegates. But of those who did show, some seemed willing to at least explore the city’s request on dealing with marijuana offenders.“I’ve always been a big proponent of decriminalizing marijuana,” said Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro.“We’ve got so many people sitting in our jails for small amounts of marijuana.“Where you have many states that are making it legal now, we have to look at that in the state of Alabama in terms of our overcrowdedness – I think we could see a big reduction – and I think this is a great step toward the city of Tuscaloosa looking at the seriousness of this crime but also allowing people who have just committed some minor incident to themselves by smoking a small amount of marijuana not to be filling our jails up.”Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, also said he believed the move to be a good idea.England reiterated Maddox’s point about how much time – sometimes hours – of an officer’s shift is spent on arresting, transporting and jailing someone caught with marijuana, no matter the amount.Allowing police to ticket those who have small amounts of the substance could reduce the officer’s engagement to about 45 minutes, England said.“It’s a public safety issue,” England said. “It’s more efficient and it actually keeps people out of jail who probably shouldn’t be there, anyway.”Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, wasn’t as enthusiastic as his fellow lawmakers.Poole, who chairs the state House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Education Committee, said changing how marijuana possession is policed at the local level would require a statewide change – not just one for Tuscaloosa – and doing so would demand a lot of consideration.“That would be a new proposal,” Poole said. “I haven’t seen anything like that in the Legislature. I think it would have a long way to go.“I think there’s a lot of analysis that would have to go into a proposal like that, and lot of public input. You’d have to really put it out there and have a public discussion on an issue like that.”Maddox touched on a number of other issues, as well.He asked the Legislature for help in regulating restaurants that, during the evening, transition into a more bar-like atmosphere. Currently, there is no license available through the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to indicate such a change.Creating one, the mayor said, would allow those living or working near these establishments to have a better understanding of what’s moving in next door.Maddox also voiced the City Council’s opposition toward eliminating prescription drug transactions from a pharmacy’s overall gross receipts. These sale totals are used to set business license fees and factoring out these sales would hurt municipalities.He estimated Tuscaloosa would lose about $200,000 each year.“And it’s not the mom-and-pop (pharmacies) that will benefit,” Maddox said. “It’s your large, out-of-state corporations that will gain the benefit of this.”Webb highlighted the city’s wish for legal liability limits extended to city employees as they are now for state or county workers.She also said the city would like clear legislation granting municipalities the authority to enforce parking regulations as civil citations. Now, cities are relying on a non-binding attorney general’s opinion to collect parking fees.Maddox also asked the delegation to consider altering the distribution model of the Simplified Sellers Use Tax and Remittance Program (SSUT), a voluntary program through which online retailers can pay a flat, reduced tax rate on certain online sales.Under this program, the state gets 50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent is divided among counties and 25 percent among cities, based on population.Currently, about 150 businesses – or about 1 percent of those that actually conduct business online in Alabama – have signed on to the program.And based on the collections and distribution model, the city of Tuscaloosa received about $409,000 in SSUT proceeds while Tuscaloosa County got about $533,000 in fiscal 2017.Maddox said this is unfair, primarily because most of the retail centers of a county lie within the corporate limits of municipalities.“Commercial sales have nothing to do with population. Commercial sales have everything to do with where those sales are occurring,” Maddox said.And unless some sweeping changes are made to how online sales are taxed in Alabama, the entire state stands to suffer, Maddox said.“Sales tax is analogous to a comet hitting the earth. The comet has hit the earth, and sales taxes are the dinosaurs,” Maddox said. “We’re all going to be impacted by it, from Huntsville to Mobile.”Reach Jason Morton at jason.morton@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0200.\n",

Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, wasn’t as enthusiastic as his fellow lawmakers.Poole, who chairs the state House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Education Committee, said changing how marijuana possession is policed at the local level would require a statewide change – not just one for Tuscaloosa – and doing so would demand a lot of consideration.“That would be a new proposal,” Poole said. “I haven’t seen anything like that in the Legislature. I think it would have a long way to go.“I think there’s a lot of analysis that would have to go into a proposal like that, and lot of public input. You’d have to really put it out there and have a public discussion on an issue like that.”Maddox touched on a number of other issues, as well.He asked the Legislature for help in regulating restaurants that, during the evening, transition into a more bar-like atmosphere. Currently, there is no license available through the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to indicate such a change.Creating one, the mayor said, would allow those living or working near these establishments to have a better understanding of what’s moving in next door.Maddox also voiced the City Council’s opposition toward eliminating prescription drug transactions from a pharmacy’s overall gross receipts. These sale totals are used to set business license fees and factoring out these sales would hurt municipalities.He estimated Tuscaloosa would lose about $200,000 each year.“And it’s not the mom-and-pop (pharmacies) that will benefit,” Maddox said. “It’s your large, out-of-state corporations that will gain the benefit of this.”Webb highlighted the city’s wish for legal liability limits extended to city employees as they are now for state or county workers.She also said the city would like clear legislation granting municipalities the authority to enforce parking regulations as civil citations. Now, cities are relying on a non-binding attorney general’s opinion to collect parking fees.Maddox also asked the delegation to consider altering the distribution model of the Simplified Sellers Use Tax and Remittance Program (SSUT), a voluntary program through which online retailers can pay a flat, reduced tax rate on certain online sales.Under this program, the state gets 50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent is divided among counties and 25 percent among cities, based on population.Currently, about 150 businesses – or about 1 percent of those that actually conduct business online in Alabama – have signed on to the program.And based on the collections and distribution model, the city of Tuscaloosa received about $409,000 in SSUT proceeds while Tuscaloosa County got about $533,000 in fiscal 2017.Maddox said this is unfair, primarily because most of the retail centers of a county lie within the corporate limits of municipalities.“Commercial sales have nothing to do with population. Commercial sales have everything to do with where those sales are occurring,” Maddox said.And unless some sweeping changes are made to how online sales are taxed in Alabama, the entire state stands to suffer, Maddox said.“Sales tax is analogous to a comet hitting the earth. The comet has hit the earth, and sales taxes are the dinosaurs,” Maddox said. “We’re all going to be impacted by it, from Huntsville to Mobile.”Reach Jason Morton at jason.morton@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0200.\n",

      "A University of Alabama football player arrested earlier this week was charged after police found less than a tenth of a gram of marijuana in his dorm room, according to court records.Officers found 0.08 grams of marijuana locked in a safe after freshman tight end Major Tennison let them search his room in the athletic dorm late Jan. 28.Tennison, 19, was in his first-floor room at Bryant Hall when an officer working in the lobby smelled marijuana at 11:21 p.m., according to records filed Friday in Tuscaloosa County District Court.The officer knocked on the door to the room because it is adjacent to the lobby, according to the report. Tennison allowed him inside, and admitted he had smoked marijuana after the officer noticed residue on a table.The officer read Tennison his rights at 11:38 p.m. before asking if there was any more marijuana in the room. Tennison first said no, according to the report, but then told him there was some left in the locked safe on the table.A police supervisor arrived at the dorm at 11:43 p.m. and searched the room, without finding anything else. The officers tested and weighed the marijuana, reporting that it was 0.08 grams -- about a quarter of the amount in an average-sized joint. Tennison wasn't arrested until Wednesday on the misdemeanor charge. He was released on $300 bond.Tennison as a 6-foot, 5-inch, 245-pound tight end from Flint, Texas listed as a freshman on the 2017 team. He played in five games during the 2017 season and caught two passes for 30 yards, according to the team’s website.\n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \" The push for legalized marijuana has moved into Utah and Oklahoma, two of the most conservative states in the country, further underscoring how quickly feelings about marijuana are changing in the United States.If the two measures pass, Utah and Oklahoma will join 30 other states that have legalized some form of medical marijuana, according to the pro-pot National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws. Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year.Utah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow use of an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns.Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, is confident the Utah and Oklahoma measures will pass.\"America's appetite for cannabis is not going away,\" Strekal said. \"We are in the death rattles of prohibition.\"Marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before \" including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.Mormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the \"Word of Wisdom,\" which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the \"wise counsel\" of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana.Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana.Advocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the Mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, Schweich said. His Washington, D.C.-based organization helped draft the measure.Unlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own except under limited circumstances, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.\"It's a question of compassion,\" Schweich said.Oklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings.Ted Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo \" one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use.Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.\"In 10 years, the church may say something different,\" Lyon said. \"This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'\"Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.\"I think there's some room for interpretation on this,\" said Frodsham.The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.\"We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state,\" McOmber said. \"This is an addictive drug.\"____Associated Press writer Adam Kealoha Causey in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.____This story has been updated to clarify that the Utah proposal would allow for some people to grow marijuana under limited circumstances.____Find complete AP marijuana coverage here: https://apnews.com/tag/LegalMarijuana\n",

Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.\"It's a question of compassion,\" Schweich said.Oklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings.Ted Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo \" one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use.Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.\"In 10 years, the church may say something different,\" Lyon said. \"This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'\"Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.\"I think there's some room for interpretation on this,\" said Frodsham.The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.\"We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state,\" McOmber said. \"This is an addictive drug.\"____Associated Press writer Adam Kealoha Causey in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.____This story has been updated to clarify that the Utah proposal would allow for some people to grow marijuana under limited circumstances.____Find complete AP marijuana coverage here: https://apnews.com/tag/LegalMarijuana\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood. But it's not quite medical marijuana.\n",
      "The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant -- but not the one that gets users high. It's not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.\n",
      "British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.\n",
      "FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.\n",
      "The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.\n",
      "Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn't contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.\n",
      "Physicians say it's important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.\n",
      "\"I'm really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,\" said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. \"In the artisanal products there's often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.\"\n",
      "Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.\n",
      "Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.\n",
      "\"I preferred this to some of those other options because it's is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,\" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.\n",
      "Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer \"drop\" seizures -- in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.\n",
      "CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.\n",
      "The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear.\n",
      "FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with \"uncertain dosages and formulations.\"\n",
      "\"We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n",
      "The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.\n",
      "Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.\n",
      "Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.\n",
      "\"I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,\" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation's largest CBD companies. \"I really don't think it's going to affect us much.\"\n",
      "Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.\n",
      "A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.\n",
      "For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.\n",
      "The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.\n",
      "The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.\n",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.\n",
      "Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.\n",
      "Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.\n",

Musser was arrested Oct. 27 when police pulled over a minivan at about 9 p.m. because it didn’t have headlights.

Elsewhere in the home, police found a bottle of liquid THC weighing 26 grams, a digital scale and loose marijuana, according to court documents.\n",

      "SECOND STREET: Officers pulled over Jamie Keefe, 39, for a broken brake light at about 9 p.m. Friday, Police Sgt. Jason Marcus said. She appeared to be under the influence of meth and a search of her car turned up two meth pipes containing meth residue, a jeweler’s bag containing meth residue and a liquid used for defrauding drug tests. Keefe performed poorly on field sobriety tests and was arrested. She was told that she couldn’t bring drugs into jail, but detention officers found 0.3 grams of marijuana in her purse. She was charged with three felonies: taking drugs into jail, possession of marijuana and possession of meth. She also was charged with five misdemeanors: using drugs, driving under the influence of drugs, not wearing a seat belt, having a broken brake light and possession of materials for defrauding a drug test, Marcus said.\n",

      "NICOLE GRAY LANDSEM, 19, and DENNIS ROBERT GONDER, 20, have been charged in Circuit Court with possession with intent to deliver marijuana, a felony. They were arrested April 16 after an anonymous caller to the Crime Stoppers tip line reported there was “a large amount of marijuana inside apartment #8” at 3506 Foothills Blvd., according to court documents. A police officer and his drug dog went to the apartments and the dog indicated drugs were present in apartment 8 after showing no interest in three other apartments. Gonder responded to the officer’s knock and the officer “could smell the overwhelming odor of raw marijuana,” according to an affidavit. After getting a search warrant, the officer found 7.5 ounces of marijuana concealed in a closet in the living room. Landsem said Gonder had gone to Colorado to buy the marijuana. Gonder said the only marijuana he knew about was shake on a couch cushion. Also in the apartment, police found 0.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms in the kitchen and 0.2 grams of LSD in Landsem’s bedroom, according to court documents. Both also are charged with misdemeanor counts of possession of a controlled substance for psilocybin mushrooms. Landsem also is charged with misdemeanor possession of LSD.\n",
